# Foreward

Welcome to "Understanding Atmospheric and Ocean Circulations: Dynamics and Phenomena". This book aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex dynamics and phenomena that govern the interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean. As we delve into the intricacies of these circulations, we will explore the role of eddy saturation and eddy compensation, two key mechanisms that have been extensively studied in the context of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).

## Eddy Saturation and Eddy Compensation

Eddy saturation and eddy compensation are two distinct dynamical mechanisms that have been the subject of extensive research. Eddy saturation refers to the insensitivity of the mean current to an increase in wind stress, a phenomenon that has been observed in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). This insensitivity is a result of the cancellation between the Eulerian circulation and eddy-induced circulation, which is depth-dependent.

On the other hand, eddy compensation refers to the near independence of the MOC to the increase of wind stress. This phenomenon is believed to be a consequence of the dynamical link between the sensitivities of the transport in the ACC and MOC. However, it is important to note that the occurrence of one does not necessarily entail the occurrence of the other.

## Models and Sensitivity

Eddy permitting and eddy resolving models have been used to examine the effect of eddy saturation and eddy compensation in the ACC. These models have shown that the MOC response is more sensitive to model resolution than the ACC transport. This suggests that the degree of eddy compensation in the Southern Ocean is currently unknown.

Ocean observations do not have a high enough resolution to fully estimate the degree of eddy saturation and eddy compensation. Idealized studies have shown that the MOC response is more sensitive to model resolution than the ACC transport. A general conclusion in such numerical models is that southward eddy transport in combination with enhanced westerlies results in an increase in EKE.

## The Labrador Sea and Convection

The Labrador Sea is a region of particular interest in the study of ocean circulations. Characteristically fresh Labrador Sea Water (LSW) is formed at intermediate depths by deep convection in the central Labrador Sea. This convection is a result of the interaction between the atmosphere and the ocean, and it plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the AMOC.

In the following chapters, we will delve deeper into these topics, exploring the complex dynamics and phenomena that govern the interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean. We hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for students and researchers alike, providing a comprehensive understanding of these crucial circulations.

Thank you for joining us on this journey.

## Chapter 1: Atmospheric and Ocean Circulations:




### Introduction

Welcome to the first chapter of "Understanding Atmospheric and Ocean Circulations: Dynamics and Phenomena". In this chapter, we will be exploring the fascinating world of shallow water gravity waves. These waves play a crucial role in the dynamics of both the atmosphere and the ocean, influencing weather patterns, ocean currents, and even the global climate.

Shallow water gravity waves are a type of wave that occurs in a fluid layer, such as the atmosphere or the ocean, where the fluid's density is stratified. These waves are generated by disturbances at the surface, such as wind or earthquakes, and propagate downwards into the fluid layer. They are governed by the principles of fluid dynamics and gravity, and their behavior can be described using mathematical equations.

In this chapter, we will delve into the fundamental principles of shallow water gravity waves, starting with their basic properties and behavior. We will then explore the different types of shallow water gravity waves, including internal waves, surface waves, and internal tides. We will also discuss the role of these waves in the larger context of atmospheric and ocean circulations, and how they interact with other phenomena such as atmospheric pressure systems and ocean currents.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of the dynamics of shallow water gravity waves and their importance in the study of atmospheric and ocean circulations. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for the rest of the book, as we delve deeper into the complex and fascinating world of atmospheric and ocean dynamics. So, let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of shallow water gravity waves.




### Section: 1.1 Surface Motions on Shallow Water

#### 1.1a Surface Gravity Waves

Surface gravity waves are a type of wave that occurs at the interface between two fluids of different densities. In the context of atmospheric and ocean circulations, these waves are often observed at the interface between the atmosphere and the ocean. They are governed by the principles of fluid dynamics and gravity, and their behavior can be described using mathematical equations.

The mathematical description of surface gravity waves is based on the linearized shallow water equations, which are derived from the Navier-Stokes equations. These equations describe the motion of a fluid layer, such as the atmosphere or the ocean, under the influence of gravity. The linearized shallow water equations are given by:

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + H_0 \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} = 0
$$

$$
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} + g \eta = 0
$$

where $\eta$ is the vertical displacement of the fluid surface, $\phi$ is the geopotential, $H_0$ is the fluid depth, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $t$ is time.

The solutions to these equations represent the propagation of surface gravity waves. The wave speed, or phase speed, of these waves is given by:

$$
c = \sqrt{\frac{gH_0}{\rho_0}}
$$

where $\rho_0$ is the fluid density. This equation shows that the wave speed increases with the square root of the fluid depth and the square root of the fluid density.

Surface gravity waves play a crucial role in the dynamics of atmospheric and ocean circulations. They are responsible for the transfer of energy and momentum between the atmosphere and the ocean, influencing weather patterns, ocean currents, and even the global climate. In the following sections, we will explore the different types of surface gravity waves and their role in these circulations.

#### 1.1b Internal Waves

Internal waves are another type of wave that occur within a fluid layer, such as the atmosphere or the ocean. Unlike surface gravity waves, which occur at the interface between two fluids, internal waves occur within a single fluid layer. They are also governed by the principles of fluid dynamics and gravity, but their behavior is described by different mathematical equations.

The mathematical description of internal waves is based on the internal wave equation, which is derived from the linearized shallow water equations. This equation describes the propagation of internal waves within a fluid layer. The internal wave equation is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x^2} = 0
$$

where $\eta$ is the vertical displacement of the fluid surface, $c$ is the wave speed, and $x$ is the horizontal direction.

The solutions to this equation represent the propagation of internal waves. The wave speed, or phase speed, of these waves is given by:

$$
c = \sqrt{gH_0}
$$

where $H_0$ is the fluid depth. This equation shows that the wave speed of internal waves is proportional to the square root of the fluid depth.

Internal waves play a crucial role in the dynamics of atmospheric and ocean circulations. They are responsible for the transfer of energy and momentum within a fluid layer, influencing the vertical structure of the atmosphere and the ocean. In the following sections, we will explore the different types of internal waves and their role in these circulations.

#### 1.1c Tidal Waves

Tidal waves, also known as tidal currents, are a type of wave that occur in the oceans due to the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun. They are a result of the conservation of angular momentum in the Earth-Moon-Sun system. Tidal waves are responsible for the rise and fall of the tides, which are crucial for the marine ecosystem and navigation.

The mathematical description of tidal waves is based on the tidal equation, which is derived from the linearized shallow water equations. This equation describes the propagation of tidal waves in the oceans. The tidal equation is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x^2} = 0
$$

where $\eta$ is the vertical displacement of the ocean surface, $c$ is the wave speed, and $x$ is the horizontal direction.

The solutions to this equation represent the propagation of tidal waves. The wave speed, or phase speed, of these waves is given by:

$$
c = \sqrt{gH_0}
$$

where $H_0$ is the fluid depth. This equation shows that the wave speed of tidal waves is proportional to the square root of the fluid depth.

Tidal waves play a crucial role in the dynamics of ocean circulations. They are responsible for the mixing of the ocean, influencing the distribution of heat and nutrients. They also play a role in the generation of internal waves, which are important for the vertical structure of the ocean. In the following sections, we will explore the different types of tidal waves and their role in these circulations.

#### 1.1d Wave Propagation

Wave propagation is a fundamental concept in the study of atmospheric and ocean circulations. It refers to the movement of waves through a medium, in this case, the atmosphere or the ocean. The propagation of waves is governed by the wave equation, which describes the relationship between the wave's speed, wavelength, and frequency.

The wave equation for shallow water gravity waves is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x^2} = 0
$$

where $\eta$ is the vertical displacement of the fluid surface, $c$ is the wave speed, and $x$ is the horizontal direction. The solutions to this equation represent the propagation of waves.

The wave speed, or phase speed, of these waves is given by:

$$
c = \sqrt{gH_0}
$$

where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity and $H_0$ is the fluid depth. This equation shows that the wave speed increases with the square root of the fluid depth.

The wavelength, or the distance between successive peaks or troughs of a wave, is given by:

$$
\lambda = \frac{2\pi}{k}
$$

where $k$ is the wave number, which is related to the wavelength by the equation:

$$
k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}
$$

The frequency, or the number of oscillations per unit time, is given by:

$$
f = \frac{1}{\tau}
$$

where $\tau$ is the period, which is the time it takes for the wave to complete one oscillation. The frequency is related to the wavelength and the wave speed by the equation:

$$
f = \frac{c}{\lambda}
$$

These equations show that the wavelength and the frequency of a wave are inversely proportional to each other. This means that waves with longer wavelengths have lower frequencies, and vice versa.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of waves that occur in the atmosphere and the ocean, and how their properties influence their propagation.

#### 1.1e Wave Interactions

Wave interactions are a crucial aspect of atmospheric and ocean circulations. They occur when two or more waves interact with each other, leading to the creation of new waves or the modification of existing ones. These interactions can be nonlinear, meaning that the resulting wave is not directly proportional to the input waves, or linear, where the resulting wave is directly proportional to the input waves.

One of the most common types of wave interactions is wave reflection. This occurs when a wave encounters a boundary, such as a shoreline or a layer of different fluid density, and is bounced back. The angle of reflection is typically equal to the angle of incidence, or the angle at which the wave hits the boundary. This is known as the law of reflection.

Another type of wave interaction is wave refraction. This occurs when a wave travels from one medium to another, or from one layer of fluid to another. The wave speed changes as it enters the new medium, causing the wave to bend. The amount of bending is determined by the wave's wavelength and the change in wave speed. This is known as the law of refraction, or Snell's law.

Wave reflection and refraction are important in the study of atmospheric and ocean circulations. They can cause waves to be trapped in certain regions, leading to the formation of standing waves. They can also cause waves to propagate in specific directions, influencing the overall circulation patterns.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of wave energy and how it is transferred between different waves and the atmosphere and the ocean.

#### 1.1f Wave Energy Transfer

Wave energy transfer is a fundamental concept in the study of atmospheric and ocean circulations. It refers to the movement of energy from one wave to another, or from a wave to the atmosphere or the ocean. This transfer of energy can occur through various mechanisms, including wave reflection, refraction, and wave breaking.

Wave energy transfer is a crucial aspect of the dynamics of atmospheric and ocean circulations. It plays a significant role in the transport of heat, momentum, and nutrients. For instance, wave energy can drive ocean currents, influencing the distribution of heat and nutrients in the ocean. It can also contribute to the mixing of the atmosphere, affecting weather patterns and climate.

The transfer of wave energy can be quantified using the concept of wave power. The power of a wave is given by the equation:

$$
P = \frac{1}{2} \rho g H_0 c \eta
$$

where $\rho$ is the fluid density, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $H_0$ is the fluid depth, $c$ is the wave speed, and $\eta$ is the vertical displacement of the fluid surface. This equation shows that the power of a wave is proportional to the wave's amplitude, frequency, and fluid depth.

Wave energy transfer can occur through wave reflection and refraction, as discussed in the previous section. It can also occur through wave breaking, which is the process by which a wave loses energy and breaks into smaller waves. This process is particularly important in the ocean, where it can lead to the mixing of the ocean surface and the atmosphere.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of wave breaking in more detail and discuss its implications for atmospheric and ocean circulations.

#### 1.1g Wave Breaking

Wave breaking is a critical process in the dynamics of atmospheric and ocean circulations. It is the mechanism by which waves lose energy and break into smaller waves. This process is particularly important in the ocean, where it can lead to the mixing of the ocean surface and the atmosphere.

The breaking of waves is a complex phenomenon that involves the interaction of waves with the ocean floor, the atmosphere, and other waves. When a wave breaks, it transfers energy and momentum to the surrounding water and the atmosphere. This energy transfer can drive ocean currents and influence weather patterns and climate.

The breaking of waves can be quantified using the concept of wave breaking rate. The breaking rate of a wave is given by the equation:

$$
B = \frac{1}{2} \rho g H_0 c \eta
$$

where $\rho$ is the fluid density, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $H_0$ is the fluid depth, $c$ is the wave speed, and $\eta$ is the vertical displacement of the fluid surface. This equation shows that the breaking rate of a wave is proportional to the wave's amplitude, frequency, and fluid depth.

The breaking of waves can occur through various mechanisms, including wave reflection, refraction, and wave-wave interactions. For instance, when a wave encounters a shoreline or a layer of different fluid density, it can be reflected or refracted, leading to the breaking of the wave. Similarly, when two waves interact, they can form a new wave with a different frequency and amplitude, leading to the breaking of the original waves.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of wave-wave interactions in more detail and discuss their implications for atmospheric and ocean circulations.

#### 1.1h Wave Mixing

Wave mixing is a crucial process in the dynamics of atmospheric and ocean circulations. It is the mechanism by which waves interact with each other and the surrounding medium, leading to the mixing of different properties such as momentum, energy, and heat. This process is particularly important in the ocean, where it can influence the distribution of nutrients and the formation of ocean currents.

The mixing of waves can occur through various mechanisms, including wave reflection, refraction, and breaking. For instance, when a wave encounters a shoreline or a layer of different fluid density, it can be reflected or refracted, leading to the mixing of the wave with the surrounding medium. Similarly, when a wave breaks, it can mix with the surrounding water and the atmosphere, leading to the transfer of energy and momentum.

The mixing of waves can be quantified using the concept of wave mixing coefficient. The mixing coefficient of a wave is given by the equation:

$$
K = \frac{1}{2} \rho g H_0 c \eta
$$

where $\rho$ is the fluid density, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $H_0$ is the fluid depth, $c$ is the wave speed, and $\eta$ is the vertical displacement of the fluid surface. This equation shows that the mixing coefficient of a wave is proportional to the wave's amplitude, frequency, and fluid depth.

The mixing of waves can have significant implications for atmospheric and ocean circulations. For instance, it can influence the distribution of heat and nutrients in the ocean, affecting the growth of marine ecosystems. It can also drive ocean currents, influencing the global climate system.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of wave mixing in more detail and discuss its implications for atmospheric and ocean circulations.

#### 1.1i Wave Propagation

Wave propagation is a fundamental concept in the study of atmospheric and ocean circulations. It refers to the movement of waves through a medium, such as the atmosphere or the ocean. This process is governed by the wave propagation equation, which describes the evolution of the wave field in response to the forces acting on it.

The wave propagation equation is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + c \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} = 0
$$

where $\eta$ is the vertical displacement of the fluid surface, $t$ is time, $x$ is the horizontal direction, and $c$ is the wave speed. This equation shows that the rate of change of the wave field in the horizontal direction is balanced by the wave speed.

The wave speed $c$ is determined by the wave dispersion relation, which relates the wave frequency to its wavelength. For shallow water waves, the dispersion relation is given by:

$$
\omega = \sqrt{gk}
$$

where $\omega$ is the wave frequency, $k$ is the wave number, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. This equation shows that the wave speed increases with the square root of the wave number, which is proportional to the wavelength.

The wave propagation equation can be used to study the propagation of waves in the atmosphere and the ocean. For instance, it can be used to analyze the dispersion of waves, which refers to the variation of the wave speed with the wave frequency. This can provide insights into the dynamics of atmospheric and ocean circulations, such as the formation of ocean currents and the transport of heat and nutrients.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of wave dispersion in more detail and discuss its implications for atmospheric and ocean circulations.

#### 1.1j Wave Breaking and Turbulence

Wave breaking and turbulence are two important phenomena in the dynamics of atmospheric and ocean circulations. They are closely related to wave propagation and mixing, as discussed in the previous sections.

Wave breaking occurs when a wave becomes unstable and breaks into smaller waves. This can happen due to various reasons, such as the interaction of waves with the ocean floor or the atmosphere, or the presence of strong vertical shear in the wave field. The breaking of waves can lead to the generation of turbulence, which is a chaotic motion of the fluid.

The breaking of waves can be quantified using the wave breaking rate, which is defined as the rate at which the wave energy is transferred to the turbulence. The breaking rate can be estimated from the wave field using the method of Lighthill (1947) or the method of Hasselmann (1962).

Turbulence, on the other hand, is a complex and chaotic motion of the fluid. It is characterized by a wide range of scales in space and time, and it plays a crucial role in the transport of energy, momentum, and heat in the atmosphere and the ocean.

The dynamics of turbulence can be studied using the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe the motion of the fluid. However, due to the complexity of the turbulent motion, these equations are often supplemented with additional assumptions and models, such as the eddy viscosity model or the k-epsilon model.

The interaction of waves with turbulence is a key aspect of atmospheric and ocean circulations. It can influence the mixing of different properties in the fluid, such as momentum, energy, and heat. It can also affect the propagation of waves, leading to phenomena such as wave trapping and wave focusing.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the study of wave breaking and turbulence, and discuss their implications for atmospheric and ocean circulations.

#### 1.1k Wave-Wave Interactions

Wave-wave interactions are a fundamental aspect of atmospheric and ocean circulations. They refer to the interactions between waves of the same or different types, which can lead to the generation of new waves, the transfer of energy and momentum, and the modification of the wave field.

The study of wave-wave interactions is a complex task due to the nonlinear nature of the wave equations. However, several methods have been developed to approximate the wave-wave interactions, such as the method of Stokes (1847) for shallow water waves, and the method of Taylor (1938) for deep water waves.

The wave-wave interactions can be quantified using the wave-wave interaction coefficient, which is defined as the ratio of the wave-wave interaction force to the wave force. This coefficient can be estimated from the wave field using the method of Longuet-Higgins (1962) or the method of Peregrine (1967).

The wave-wave interactions can have significant implications for atmospheric and ocean circulations. For instance, they can influence the dispersion of waves, leading to the formation of wave packets or the generation of solitons. They can also affect the mixing of different properties in the fluid, such as momentum, energy, and heat.

# Internal wave

## Dispersion relation

The dispersion relation describes the relationship between wavelength and frequency in waves. Distinction can be made between pure internal waves – fully dominated by the effects of buoyancy – and internal–gravity waves which are also affected by gravity.

### Internal waves, proper

The dispersion relation for internal waves is

\omega^2=\frac{g}{\rho_0}\, |k|^2,
where $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $g$ the acceleration due to gravity, $\rho_0$ the density of the fluid, and $k$ the wavenumber. The wavelength is
$$
\lambda=\frac{2 \pi}{k}.
$$
For the boundary between fluid and vacuum (free surface), the dispersion relation reduces to
$$
\omega^2=\frac{g}{\rho_0}\, |k|^2.
$$

### Gravity–internal waves

When internal waves are also affected substantially by gravity, they are called gravity–internal waves. Their dispersion relation reads, for waves on the interface between two fluids of infinite depth:

$$
\omega^2=|k|\left( \frac{\rho_1-\rho_2}{\rho_1+\rho_2}g+\frac{g}{\rho_0}k^2\right),
$$

where $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ are the mass density of the two fluids ($\rho_1 > \rho_2$). The factor $(\rho_1-\rho_2)/(\rho_1+\rho_2)$ in the first term is the Atwood number.

#### Gravity wave regime

For large wavelengths (small $k = 2\pi/\lambda$), only the first term is relevant and one has gravity waves.
In this limit, the waves have a group velocity half the phase velocity: following a single wave's crest in a group one can see the wave appearing at the back of the group, growing and finally disappearing at the front of the group.

#### Capillary wave regime

Shorter (large $k$) waves, which are proper internal waves, do the opposite: an individual wave's crest can be seen to move forward in the group, while the wave's trough moves backward.

#### 1.1c Tidal Waves

Tidal waves are another type of wave that occur in the atmosphere and oceans. They are generated by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun on the Earth's oceans. Tidal waves are responsible for the rise and fall of the tide, and they play a crucial role in the dynamics of atmospheric and ocean circulations.

The mathematical description of tidal waves is based on the linearized shallow water equations, similar to surface gravity waves. However, tidal waves are influenced by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun, which adds a layer of complexity to their behavior. The solutions to these equations represent the propagation of tidal waves, which can travel long distances across the ocean.

Tidal waves are responsible for the mixing of the ocean, which plays a crucial role in the global climate system. They also influence the dynamics of the atmosphere, particularly in the upper layers where they can interact with atmospheric waves. Understanding tidal waves is therefore essential for understanding the dynamics of atmospheric and ocean circulations.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of atmospheric and ocean circulations, and how they are influenced by the various types of waves we have discussed in this chapter.

#### 1.1d Wave Propagation

Wave propagation is a fundamental concept in the study of atmospheric and ocean circulations. It refers to the movement of waves through a medium, in this case, the atmosphere or the ocean. The propagation of waves is governed by the wave equation, which describes how the wave's amplitude, frequency, and phase change as the wave moves through the medium.

The wave equation for shallow water gravity waves can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $\eta$ is the wave's amplitude, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the wave speed. The wave speed is given by the equation:

$$
c = \sqrt{gH}
$$

where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity and $H$ is the water depth.

The wave equation can be solved to find the wave's amplitude, frequency, and phase as a function of time and space. This allows us to understand how the wave propagates through the medium, and how it interacts with other waves and with the medium itself.

In the context of atmospheric and ocean circulations, wave propagation plays a crucial role. Waves, such as surface gravity waves and internal waves, are responsible for the transport of energy and momentum across the ocean and atmosphere. They also play a key role in the mixing of the ocean, which is essential for the global climate system.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of wave reflection and refraction, which are important phenomena in wave propagation.

#### 1.1e Wave Reflection and Refraction

Wave reflection and refraction are two fundamental phenomena that occur when waves encounter a boundary between two different media. In the context of atmospheric and ocean circulations, these phenomena are crucial for understanding how waves propagate across the interface between the atmosphere and the ocean.

##### Wave Reflection

Wave reflection occurs when a wave encounters a boundary and is bounced back into the medium from which it came. The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
\theta_i = \theta_r
$$

where $\theta_i$ is the angle of incidence and $\theta_r$ is the angle of reflection, both measured from the normal to the boundary.

In the context of shallow water gravity waves, wave reflection can occur at the interface between the atmosphere and the ocean. This can have significant implications for the propagation of waves across this interface. For example, if a wave is reflected back into the atmosphere, it can interact with other waves and atmospheric currents, potentially leading to the formation of new waves or the modification of existing ones.

##### Wave Refraction

Wave refraction, on the other hand, occurs when a wave passes from one medium to another. The wave's speed changes as it enters the new medium, causing its wavelength and frequency to change. This change in wavelength and frequency is what we refer to as refraction.

The law of refraction, also known as Snell's law, describes how the wave's angle of incidence changes as it enters a new medium. This law can be expressed as:

$$
n_1 \sin(\theta_i) = n_2 \sin(\theta_r)
$$

where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the refractive indices of the two media, and $\theta_i$ and $\theta_r$ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.

In the context of shallow water gravity waves, wave refraction can occur at the interface between the atmosphere and the ocean. This can lead to the formation of wave fronts, which are lines of constant phase. These wave fronts can interact with atmospheric and oceanic currents, leading to complex wave patterns and dynamics.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of wave breaking, another important phenomenon in the propagation of waves in the atmosphere and ocean.

#### 1.1f Wave Breaking

Wave breaking is a phenomenon that occurs when a wave becomes unstable and breaks apart, releasing energy and mixing the fluid. This process is particularly important in the context of atmospheric and ocean circulations, as it can significantly influence the propagation of waves and the transport of energy and momentum across the atmosphere-ocean interface.

##### Wave Breaking Mechanisms

There are several mechanisms that can lead to wave breaking. One of the most common is the nonlinear interaction between waves, which can cause a wave to become unstable and break. This can occur when two waves of different frequencies interact, leading to the generation of a third wave with a frequency that is a sum or difference of the original frequencies. This process, known as wave-wave interaction, can be described by the nonlinear wave equation:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x^2} + \frac{1}{2} g \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \eta^2 + \frac{1}{3} \eta^3 \right)
$$

where $\eta$ is the wave's amplitude, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, $c$ is the wave speed, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

Another mechanism that can lead to wave breaking is the interaction between waves and currents. If a wave propagates into a current, the wave can become distorted and eventually break. This process, known as wave-current interaction, can be described by the wave-current interaction equation:

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + c \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{2} g \eta = 0
$$

where $\eta$ is the wave's amplitude, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, $c$ is the wave speed, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

##### Wave Breaking and Energy Transfer

When a wave breaks, it releases energy and momentum into the surrounding fluid. This energy and momentum can then be transferred to other waves or currents, influencing the propagation of waves and the transport of energy and momentum across the atmosphere-ocean interface.

The energy transfer associated with wave breaking can be quantified using the wave breaking energy spectrum, which describes the distribution of energy over different scales of wave breaking. This spectrum can be used to estimate the total energy transfer due to wave breaking, which can be a significant component of the total energy transfer in atmospheric and ocean circulations.

\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + c \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{2} g \eta = 0
$$

where $\eta$ is the wave's amplitude, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, $c$ is the wave speed, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

##### Wave Mixing and Energy Transfer

When a wave breaks in shallow water, it can transfer energy and momentum to the other medium. This energy and momentum can then be transferred to other waves or currents, influencing the propagation of waves and the transport of energy and momentum across the atmosphere-ocean interface. This process, known as wave mixing, can be described by the wave mixing equation:

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + c \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} = 0
$$

where $\eta$ is the wave's amplitude, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the wave speed.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of wave reflection and refraction in more detail, and discuss their implications for the dynamics of atmospheric and oceanic circulations.

#### 1.1n Wave Propagation in Deep Water

Wave propagation in deep water is a crucial aspect of atmospheric and oceanic circulations. It refers to the movement of waves across the atmosphere-ocean interface, and can significantly influence the transport of energy and momentum across this interface.

##### Wave Propagation Mechanisms

Wave propagation in deep water can occur due to several mechanisms. One of the most common is the interaction between waves and the atmosphere-ocean interface. When a wave encounters this interface, part of the wave is reflected back into the atmosphere or ocean, while the other part is transmitted into the other medium. This process, known as wave propagation, can be described by the propagation equation:

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + c \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} = 0

##### Wave Breaking Mechanisms

Wave breaking in deep water can occur due to several mechanisms. One of the most common is the interaction between waves and the atmosphere-ocean interface.

### Section: 1.1c Internal Waves

Internal waves are a type of wave that occur within the atmosphere and oceans. They are generated by the interaction of different layers of fluid with different densities, and can have a significant impact on the dynamics of these systems.

#### 1.1c.1 Generation of Internal Waves

Internal waves are generated when there is a disturbance in the fluid layers, such as a change in wind speed or direction, or a change in temperature. This disturbance causes a change in the density of the fluid layers, leading to the generation of internal waves.

The generation of internal waves can be described by the dispersion relation, which relates the wavelength and frequency of the waves to the properties of the fluid. For internal waves, the dispersion relation is given by:

$$
\omega^2=\frac{g}{\rho_0}\, |k|^2,
$$

where $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\rho_0$ is the density of the fluid, and $k$ is the wavenumber. The wavelength is then given by:

$$
\lambda=\frac{2 \pi}{k}.
$$

#### 1.1c.2 Types of Internal Waves

There are two main types of internal waves: internal waves and gravity-internal waves. Internal waves are fully dominated by the effects of buoyancy, while gravity-internal waves are also affected by gravity.

The dispersion relation for internal waves is given by:

$$
\omega^2=\frac{g}{\rho_0}\, |k|^2,
$$

while the dispersion relation for gravity-internal waves is given by:

$$
\omega^2=|k|\left( \frac{\rho_1-\rho_2}{\rho_1+\rho_2}g+\frac{g}{\rho_0}k^2\right),
$$

where $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ are the mass density of the two fluids ($\rho_1 > \rho_2$). The factor $(\rho_1-\rho_2)/(\rho_1+\rho_2)$ in the first term is the Atwood number.

#### 1.1c.3 Impact of Internal Waves on Atmospheric and Oceanic Circulations

Internal waves play a crucial role in the dynamics of atmospheric and oceanic circulations. They can transport energy and momentum, and can also mix different layers of fluid, leading to changes in temperature and salinity.

In the atmosphere, internal waves can contribute to the mixing of the boundary layer, leading to changes in the vertical structure of the atmosphere. In the oceans, internal waves can play a role in the vertical mixing of the water column, leading to changes in the distribution of heat and nutrients.

Understanding the generation and impact of internal waves is crucial for predicting and understanding atmospheric and oceanic circulations. In the next section, we will explore the role of internal waves in the dynamics of these systems in more detail.





### Section: 1.1d Surface Currents

Surface currents are a type of oceanic current that flows along the surface of the ocean. They are driven by a combination of wind, tides, and density differences. Surface currents play a crucial role in the global ocean circulation, transporting heat, nutrients, and other properties across the ocean basins.

#### 1.1d.1 Generation of Surface Currents

Surface currents are primarily generated by wind stress, which is the force exerted by the wind on the surface of the ocean. The wind stress is responsible for the Ekman transport, which is the movement of water caused by the wind. The Ekman transport is responsible for the generation of surface currents.

The Ekman transport is given by the Ekman spiral, which is a theoretical model that describes the movement of water in response to wind stress. The Ekman spiral is given by:

$$
u = \frac{\tau_0}{\rho_0 f_0} \frac{K_z(z)}{z} e^{i(k_xx+k_yy-\omega t)},
$$

where $\tau_0$ is the wind stress, $\rho_0$ is the density of the water, $f_0$ is the Coriolis parameter, $K_z(z)$ is the vertical wavenumber, $z$ is the vertical coordinate (positive upwards), $k_x$ and $k_y$ are the horizontal wavenumbers, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency.

#### 1.1d.2 Types of Surface Currents

There are two main types of surface currents: wind-driven currents and tidal currents. Wind-driven currents are generated by wind stress, while tidal currents are generated by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun.

Wind-driven currents are further classified into two types: Ekman transport and Langmuir circulation. Ekman transport is the primary mechanism for generating wind-driven currents, while Langmuir circulation is a secondary mechanism that is responsible for the mixing of the water column.

Tidal currents are classified into two types: spring tide and neap tide. Spring tide occurs when the moon and the sun are aligned, while neap tide occurs when the moon and the sun are at right angles. Spring tide is responsible for the generation of strong tidal currents, while neap tide is responsible for weak tidal currents.

#### 1.1d.3 Impact of Surface Currents on Oceanic Circulations

Surface currents play a crucial role in the global ocean circulation. They are responsible for the transport of heat, nutrients, and other properties across the ocean basins. Surface currents also play a crucial role in the formation of ocean eddies, which are circular currents that play a crucial role in the mixing of the water column.

Surface currents also play a crucial role in the formation of oceanic fronts, which are regions of sharp density gradients that occur at the boundaries of oceanic currents. Oceanic fronts are responsible for the formation of upwelling and downwelling, which are processes that bring nutrients to the surface and transport heat to the deep ocean.

In conclusion, surface currents are a crucial component of the global ocean circulation. They are responsible for the transport of heat, nutrients, and other properties across the ocean basins, and play a crucial role in the formation of oceanic fronts and eddies. Understanding the dynamics of surface currents is essential for understanding the dynamics of the global ocean circulation.

### Section: 1.2 Small-amplitude Shallow-water Surface Waves:

#### 1.2b Dispersion Relation

The dispersion relation is a fundamental concept in the study of shallow water gravity waves. It describes the relationship between the wave's frequency and its wavenumber, and is crucial for understanding the behavior of waves in a shallow water environment.

The dispersion relation for small-amplitude shallow-water surface waves can be derived from the linear theory of shallow-water waves. The dispersion relation is given by:

$$
\omega = \sqrt{gk}
$$

where $\omega$ is the wave frequency, $k$ is the wavenumber, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. This equation shows that the wave frequency is proportional to the square root of the product of the acceleration due to gravity and the wavenumber.

The dispersion relation is a key tool in the study of shallow water gravity waves. It allows us to understand the behavior of waves in a shallow water environment, and to predict their frequency and wavenumber. The dispersion relation is also used in the study of other phenomena, such as the Debye model in classical mechanics.

The Debye model, for example, uses the dispersion relation to describe the behavior of an equidistant chain of masses that interact harmonically with each other. The dispersion relation in this case is given by:

$$
\omega (k) = 2 \sqrt {\frac {\kappa}{m}}\left|\sin\left(\frac {k a}{2}\right)\right|
$$

where $\omega$ is the wave frequency, $k$ is the wavenumber, $\kappa$ is the wave number, and $m$ is the mass of the chain. This equation shows that the wave frequency is proportional to the square root of the product of the wave number and the mass of the chain.

The Debye model also uses the dispersion relation to describe the behavior of the mode with the larger wavenumber, which is indistinguishable from the one with the smaller wavenumber. This is possible because the system consists of discretized points, as demonstrated in the animated picture.

The dispersion relation is a powerful tool in the study of shallow water gravity waves. It allows us to understand the behavior of waves in a shallow water environment, and to predict their frequency and wavenumber. The dispersion relation is also used in the study of other phenomena, such as the Debye model in classical mechanics.




#### 1.2c Energy and Momentum Transport

In the previous sections, we have discussed the dispersion relation and its importance in understanding the behavior of shallow water gravity waves. Now, we will delve into the concepts of energy and momentum transport in these waves.

The energy and momentum transport in shallow water gravity waves are governed by the principles of conservation of energy and momentum. These principles are fundamental to understanding the dynamics of these waves.

The conservation of energy principle states that the total energy of a system remains constant unless it is transferred from one part of the system to another. In the context of shallow water gravity waves, this principle can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int \frac{1}{2} \rho g h^2 + \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 dA + \int \rho g h v_n dA = 0
$$

where $\rho$ is the density, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $h$ is the wave height, $v$ is the wave velocity, $v_n$ is the normal component of the wave velocity, $dA$ is the differential area, and $t$ is time.

The conservation of momentum principle, on the other hand, states that the total momentum of a system remains constant unless it is transferred from one part of the system to another. In the context of shallow water gravity waves, this principle can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int \rho v dA + \int \sigma_{ij} \frac{\partial v_i}{\partial x_j} dA = 0
$$

where $\sigma_{ij}$ is the stress tensor, $v_i$ is the velocity in the $i$ direction, and $x_j$ is the position in the $j$ direction.

These principles are crucial for understanding the behavior of shallow water gravity waves. They allow us to predict the energy and momentum transport in these waves, and to understand the conditions under which these waves can propagate.

In the next section, we will discuss the applications of these principles in the study of shallow water gravity waves. We will explore how these principles can be used to understand the behavior of these waves in various scenarios, and to predict their future behavior.




#### 1.2d Wave Breaking

Wave breaking is a critical phenomenon in shallow water gravity waves. It is the process by which the wave energy is transferred from the wave to the surrounding water and air, leading to the dissipation of the wave. This process is governed by the principles of conservation of energy and momentum, as discussed in the previous section.

The breaking of a wave can be categorized into two types: spilling and plunging. 

##### Spilling Breakers

Spilling breakers occur when the wave approaches the shore and the wave height is amplified due to the shallowing of the ocean floor. The wave crest becomes unstable and starts to spill down the face of the wave, creating turbulent whitewater. This process continues as the wave approaches the shore, and the wave's energy is slowly dissipated in the whitewater. Spilling waves break for a longer time than other waves, and create a relatively gentle wave. Onshore wind conditions make spillers more likely.

The breaking of a spilling wave can be described by the following equation:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int \frac{1}{2} \rho g h^2 + \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 dA + \int \rho g h v_n dA = 0
$$

where $\rho$ is the density, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $h$ is the wave height, $v$ is the wave velocity, $v_n$ is the normal component of the wave velocity, $dA$ is the differential area, and $t$ is time.

##### Plunging Breakers

Plunging breakers occur when the ocean floor is steep or has sudden depth changes, such as from a reef or sandbar. The crest of the wave becomes much steeper than a spilling wave, becomes vertical, then curls over and drops onto the trough of the wave, releasing most of its energy at once in a relatively violent impact. A plunging wave breaks with more energy than a significantly larger spilling wave. The wave can trap and compress the air under the lip, which creates the "crashing" sound associated with waves. With large waves, this crash can be felt by beachgoers on land.

The breaking of a plunging wave can be described by the following equation:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \int \frac{1}{2} \rho g h^2 + \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 dA + \int \rho g h v_n dA = 0
$$

where $\rho$ is the density, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $h$ is the wave height, $v$ is the wave velocity, $v_n$ is the normal component of the wave velocity, $dA$ is the differential area, and $t$ is time.

In the next section, we will discuss the role of wave breaking in the energy balance of the ocean and atmosphere.




#### 1.3a Basic Concepts of Non-dispersive Waves

Non-dispersive waves are a fundamental concept in the study of shallow water gravity waves. They are characterized by the fact that the phase speed of the wave crests is independent of the frequency of the wave. This is in contrast to dispersive waves, where the phase speed depends on the frequency.

The non-dispersive nature of shallow water gravity waves is a result of the balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. This balance leads to the shallow water equations, which describe the motion of the fluid in the horizontal plane. The shallow water equations can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial (hu)}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial (hv)}{\partial y} = 0
$$

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + g \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} = 0
$$

$$
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} + g \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial y} = 0
$$

where $\eta$ is the surface elevation, $u$ and $v$ are the horizontal velocities in the $x$ and $y$ directions respectively, $h$ is the water depth, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

The non-dispersive nature of these waves is evident in the fact that the phase speed of the wave crests, $c$, is independent of the frequency, $k$, and the water depth, $h$. This can be seen from the dispersion relation for shallow water gravity waves:

$$
c = \sqrt{\frac{g h}{k}}
$$

where $k$ is the wavenumber. This equation shows that the phase speed of the wave crests is proportional to the square root of the product of the acceleration due to gravity, the water depth, and the inverse of the wavenumber. This means that the phase speed is independent of the frequency and the water depth, which is the defining characteristic of non-dispersive waves.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of this non-dispersive nature for the propagation of shallow water gravity waves.

#### 1.3b Non-dispersive Wave Solutions

The non-dispersive nature of shallow water gravity waves allows us to derive some interesting solutions to the shallow water equations. These solutions provide insights into the behavior of the waves and their interaction with the fluid.

One such solution is the solitary wave, also known as a soliton. A solitary wave is a solitary hump or depression of the fluid surface, which travels without changing its shape or speed. The solitary wave solution to the shallow water equations is given by:

$$
\eta(x,y,t) = \frac{A}{2} \text{sech}^2 \left( \frac{\sqrt{gA}}{2} (x - ct) \right)
$$

where $A$ is the amplitude of the wave and $c$ is the phase speed of the wave. The solitary wave solution represents a stable solution to the shallow water equations, and it is the only stable solution for certain initial conditions.

Another important solution to the shallow water equations is the internal wave. Internal waves occur when there is a density stratification in the fluid, and they can propagate both horizontally and vertically. The internal wave solution to the shallow water equations is given by:

$$
\eta(x,y,t) = A \cos(kx + ly - \omega t)
$$

where $A$ is the amplitude of the wave, $k$ and $l$ are the wavenumbers in the $x$ and $y$ directions respectively, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the wave. The internal wave solution represents a dispersive wave, as the phase speed of the wave crests depends on the frequency of the wave.

The non-dispersive nature of shallow water gravity waves also leads to the formation of wave groups, or wave packets. A wave packet is a group of waves with different frequencies and wavenumbers, which travel together without changing their relative positions. The wave packet solution to the shallow water equations is given by:

$$
\eta(x,y,t) = \int A(k,l) \cos(kx + ly - \omega t) dk dl
$$

where $A(k,l)$ is the amplitude of the wave with wavenumbers $k$ and $l$, and the integral is taken over all wavenumbers. The wave packet solution represents a dispersive wave, as the phase speed of the wave crests depends on the frequency of the wave.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of these solutions for the propagation of shallow water gravity waves.

#### 1.3c Non-dispersive Wave Phenomena

The non-dispersive nature of shallow water gravity waves leads to several interesting phenomena that are observed in the real world. These phenomena are a direct result of the balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force, which is what gives rise to the shallow water equations in the first place.

One such phenomenon is the formation of wave groups, or wave packets. As we saw in the previous section, a wave packet is a group of waves with different frequencies and wavenumbers, which travel together without changing their relative positions. This is a direct consequence of the non-dispersive nature of shallow water gravity waves.

Another interesting phenomenon is the formation of solitary waves, or solitons. Solitons are solitary humps or depressions of the fluid surface, which travel without changing their shape or speed. The solitary wave solution to the shallow water equations is given by:

$$
\eta(x,y,t) = \frac{A}{2} \text{sech}^2 \left( \frac{\sqrt{gA}}{2} (x - ct) \right)
$$

where $A$ is the amplitude of the wave and $c$ is the phase speed of the wave. Solitons are stable solutions to the shallow water equations, and they are the only stable solution for certain initial conditions.

The non-dispersive nature of shallow water gravity waves also leads to the formation of internal waves. Internal waves occur when there is a density stratification in the fluid, and they can propagate both horizontally and vertically. The internal wave solution to the shallow water equations is given by:

$$
\eta(x,y,t) = A \cos(kx + ly - \omega t)
$$

where $A$ is the amplitude of the wave, $k$ and $l$ are the wavenumbers in the $x$ and $y$ directions respectively, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the wave. Internal waves are dispersive waves, as the phase speed of the wave crests depends on the frequency of the wave.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of these phenomena for the propagation of shallow water gravity waves.

#### 1.3d Non-dispersive Wave Applications

The non-dispersive nature of shallow water gravity waves has several practical applications in various fields. These applications are a direct result of the phenomena observed in non-dispersive waves, such as the formation of wave groups, solitary waves, and internal waves.

One of the most significant applications of non-dispersive waves is in the field of oceanography. The balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force, which gives rise to the shallow water equations, is also responsible for the formation of ocean currents. These currents play a crucial role in the global climate system, as they transport heat and nutrients around the world's oceans.

The non-dispersive nature of shallow water gravity waves also has implications for the propagation of waves in the ocean. For instance, the formation of wave groups, or wave packets, can help in the prediction of wave patterns in the ocean. This is particularly useful in the design of offshore structures, such as oil rigs, which need to withstand the forces exerted by the waves.

In the field of meteorology, the non-dispersive nature of shallow water gravity waves is responsible for the formation of certain weather patterns. For example, the formation of solitary waves, or solitons, can lead to the formation of atmospheric fronts, which are regions of sharp temperature gradients in the atmosphere. These fronts can trigger severe weather events, such as thunderstorms and hurricanes.

Finally, the non-dispersive nature of shallow water gravity waves also has implications for the propagation of waves in the atmosphere. For instance, the formation of internal waves can lead to the mixing of different layers of air in the atmosphere, which can have significant implications for the distribution of heat and nutrients in the atmosphere.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical models that describe these phenomena, and how they can be used to predict and understand the behavior of shallow water gravity waves.




#### 1.3b Wave Propagation Equations

The wave propagation equations are a set of equations that describe the propagation of waves in a medium. In the context of shallow water gravity waves, these equations are derived from the shallow water equations and describe the propagation of waves in the horizontal plane.

The wave propagation equations can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial (hu)}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial (hv)}{\partial y} = 0
$$

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + g \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} = 0
$$

$$
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} + g \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial y} = 0
$$

where $\eta$ is the surface elevation, $u$ and $v$ are the horizontal velocities in the $x$ and $y$ directions respectively, $h$ is the water depth, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

These equations describe the propagation of waves in the horizontal plane. The first equation represents the conservation of mass, the second and third equations represent the conservation of momentum in the $x$ and $y$ directions respectively, and the last equation represents the conservation of energy.

The wave propagation equations are non-dispersive, meaning that the phase speed of the wave crests, $c$, is independent of the frequency, $k$, and the water depth, $h$. This can be seen from the dispersion relation for shallow water gravity waves:

$$
c = \sqrt{\frac{g h}{k}}
$$

where $k$ is the wavenumber. This equation shows that the phase speed of the wave crests is proportional to the square root of the product of the acceleration due to gravity, the water depth, and the inverse of the wavenumber. This means that the phase speed is independent of the frequency and the water depth, which is the defining characteristic of non-dispersive waves.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of these wave propagation equations for the propagation of shallow water gravity waves.

#### 1.3c Non-dispersive Wave Solutions

Non-dispersive wave solutions are solutions to the wave propagation equations that do not depend on the frequency of the wave. These solutions are particularly important in the study of shallow water gravity waves, as they allow us to understand the propagation of waves in the horizontal plane without the complications introduced by dispersion.

The non-dispersive wave solutions to the wave propagation equations can be found by setting the frequency, $k$, to zero in the dispersion relation:

$$
c = \sqrt{\frac{g h}{k}}
$$

This results in a phase speed, $c$, that is independent of the frequency, $k$, and the water depth, $h$. This is a key characteristic of non-dispersive waves, and it is what makes them particularly useful in the study of shallow water gravity waves.

The non-dispersive wave solutions to the wave propagation equations can be written as:

$$
\eta(x,y,t) = \eta_0(x,y)e^{i(kx+ly-\omega t)}
$$

$$
u(x,y,t) = u_0(x,y)e^{i(kx+ly-\omega t)}
$$

$$
v(x,y,t) = v_0(x,y)e^{i(kx+ly-\omega t)}
$$

where $\eta_0(x,y)$, $u_0(x,y)$, and $v_0(x,y)$ are the amplitude functions, $k$ is the wavenumber, $l$ is the meridional wavenumber, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency.

These solutions represent waves that propagate in the horizontal plane with a constant phase speed, $c$, and a constant wavelength, $\lambda = 2\pi/k$. This is a key characteristic of non-dispersive waves, and it is what makes them particularly useful in the study of shallow water gravity waves.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of these non-dispersive wave solutions for the propagation of shallow water gravity waves.




#### 1.3c Conservation Laws

Conservation laws are fundamental principles in physics that describe the behavior of physical quantities in a system. These laws are derived from the fundamental laws of physics, such as the laws of classical mechanics, electromagnetism, and thermodynamics. In the context of shallow water gravity waves, conservation laws play a crucial role in understanding the propagation and behavior of these waves.

The conservation laws for shallow water gravity waves can be derived from the wave propagation equations. These laws describe the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy in the system. 

The conservation of mass, also known as the continuity equation, is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial (hu)}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial (hv)}{\partial y} = 0
$$

This equation states that the rate of change of mass in a volume of water is equal to the net flux of mass across the boundaries of that volume.

The conservation of momentum, also known as the momentum equation, is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + g \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} = 0
$$

This equation states that the rate of change of momentum in a volume of water is equal to the net flux of momentum across the boundaries of that volume, plus the gravitational force acting on the volume.

The conservation of energy, also known as the energy equation, is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} + g \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial y} = 0
$$

This equation states that the rate of change of energy in a volume of water is equal to the net flux of energy across the boundaries of that volume, plus the gravitational potential energy due to changes in the surface elevation.

These conservation laws are non-dispersive, meaning that the phase speed of the wave crests, $c$, is independent of the frequency, $k$, and the water depth, $h$. This can be seen from the dispersion relation for shallow water gravity waves:

$$
c = \sqrt{\frac{g h}{k}}
$$

where $k$ is the wavenumber. This equation shows that the phase speed of the wave crests is proportional to the square root of the product of the acceleration due to gravity, the water depth, and the inverse of the wavenumber. This means that the phase speed is independent of the frequency and the water depth, which is the defining characteristic of non-dispersive waves.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of these conservation laws for the propagation of shallow water gravity waves.




#### 1.4a Forced Oscillations

Forced oscillations occur when an oscillating system is subjected to an external force. This external force can be periodic, such as in the case of a spring-mass system with a sinusoidal driving force, or non-periodic, such as in the case of a system subjected to a random force. 

The simplest example of a forced oscillation is a spring-mass system with a sinusoidal driving force. The equation of motion for this system is given by:

$$
\ddot{x} + 2 \beta\dot{x} + \omega_0^2 x = f(t),
$$

where $f(t) = f_0 \cos(\omega t + \delta)$. The solution to this equation is given by:

$$
x(t) = A \cos(\omega t - \delta) + A_{tr} \cos(\omega_1 t - \delta_{tr}),
$$

where $A = \sqrt{\frac {f_0^2} {(\omega_0^2 - \omega ^2) + 2 \beta \omega}}$ and $\delta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac {2 \beta \omega} {\omega_0^2 - \omega^2}\right)$. The second term of the solution is the transient solution to the differential equation, which can be found by using the initial conditions of the system.

Some systems can be excited by energy transfer from the environment. This transfer typically occurs where systems are embedded in some fluid flow. For example, the phenomenon of flutter in aerodynamics occurs when an arbitrarily small displacement of an aircraft wing (from its equilibrium) results in an increase in the angle of attack of the wing on the air flow and a consequential increase in lift coefficient, leading to a still greater displacement. At sufficiently large displacements, the stiffness of the wing dominates to provide the restoring force that enables an oscillation.

Resonance occurs in a damped driven oscillator when $\omega = \omega_0$, that is, when the driving frequency is equal to the natural frequency of the system. When this occurs, the denominator of the amplitude is minimized, which maximizes the amplitude of the oscillations.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of resonance in more detail and explore its implications for shallow water gravity waves.

#### 1.4b Damped Oscillations

Damped oscillations occur when an oscillating system is subjected to a damping force. This damping force is typically a function of the velocity of the system and is responsible for the eventual decay of the oscillations. The equation of motion for a damped oscillator is given by:

$$
\ddot{x} + 2 \beta\dot{x} + \omega_0^2 x = 0,
$$

where $\beta$ is the damping coefficient and $\omega_0$ is the natural frequency of the system. The solution to this equation is given by:

$$
x(t) = A e^{-\beta t} \cos(\omega_0 t - \delta),
$$

where $A$ and $\delta$ are constants determined by the initial conditions of the system. The damping term $e^{-\beta t}$ causes the amplitude of the oscillations to decay exponentially over time.

The damping coefficient $\beta$ plays a crucial role in the behavior of damped oscillations. A larger damping coefficient results in a faster decay of the oscillations, while a smaller damping coefficient results in a slower decay. In the limit of $\beta = 0$, the oscillations become undamped and the system exhibits simple harmonic motion.

The concept of damping is crucial in understanding the behavior of many physical systems, including shallow water gravity waves. In the context of these waves, damping can occur due to friction with the bottom of the water body, turbulence, and energy transfer to the atmosphere. Understanding the effects of damping on these waves is essential for predicting their behavior and impact on the larger atmospheric and oceanic circulations.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of resonance in more detail and discuss its implications for forced oscillations.

#### 1.4c Free Oscillations

Free oscillations occur when an oscillating system is not subjected to any external force. In the absence of any driving force, the system oscillates with its natural frequency. The equation of motion for a free oscillator is given by:

$$
\ddot{x} + \omega_0^2 x = 0,
$$

where $\omega_0$ is the natural frequency of the system. The solution to this equation is given by:

$$
x(t) = A \cos(\omega_0 t - \delta),
$$

where $A$ and $\delta$ are constants determined by the initial conditions of the system. The absence of any external force results in simple harmonic motion, where the amplitude of the oscillations remains constant over time.

The natural frequency $\omega_0$ is a fundamental property of the system and is determined by the system's mass and stiffness. A larger mass or a stiffer system results in a higher natural frequency. The natural frequency is also affected by the damping coefficient $\beta$, with a larger damping coefficient resulting in a lower natural frequency.

In the context of shallow water gravity waves, free oscillations can occur in the absence of any external forcing, such as wind stress. These free oscillations can provide valuable insights into the inherent dynamics of the water body, including its stratification and mixing properties.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of resonance in more detail and discuss its implications for forced oscillations.

#### 1.4d Resonance

Resonance is a phenomenon that occurs when a system is driven at its natural frequency. This results in large amplitude oscillations, often leading to instability. In the context of shallow water gravity waves, resonance can occur when the frequency of the external forcing, such as wind stress, matches the natural frequency of the water body.

The concept of resonance is closely related to the concept of natural frequency. The natural frequency of a system is the frequency at which it oscillates in the absence of any external force. When a system is driven at its natural frequency, the amplitude of the oscillations can become very large, leading to resonance.

The equation of motion for a system undergoing resonance is given by:

$$
\ddot{x} + \omega_0^2 x = f(t),
$$

where $\omega_0$ is the natural frequency of the system, $f(t)$ is the external force, and $x$ is the displacement of the system. The solution to this equation is given by:

$$
x(t) = A \cos(\omega_0 t - \delta) + A_{tr} \cos(\omega_1 t - \delta_{tr}),
$$

where $A$ and $\delta$ are constants determined by the initial conditions of the system, and $A_{tr}$ and $\delta_{tr}$ are constants determined by the external force. The second term of the solution represents the transient response of the system to the external force, while the first term represents the steady-state response.

In the context of shallow water gravity waves, resonance can lead to large amplitude oscillations, which can have significant implications for the dynamics of the water body. For example, resonance can lead to the formation of internal waves, which can play a crucial role in the mixing and stratification of the water body.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of resonance in more detail and discuss its implications for shallow water gravity waves.

## Chapter: Chapter 2: Atmospheric and Oceanic Circulations

### Introduction

The second chapter of "Comprehensive Guide to Atmospheric and Oceanic Circulations" delves into the intricate world of atmospheric and oceanic circulations. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental principles and mechanisms that govern the movement of air and water in the atmosphere and oceans.

Atmospheric and oceanic circulations are integral parts of the Earth's climate system. They play a crucial role in redistributing heat and moisture around the globe, influencing weather patterns, climate variability, and change. Understanding these circulations is not only essential for meteorologists and oceanographers but also for climate scientists, policy-makers, and anyone interested in the complex dynamics of our planet's climate system.

In this chapter, we will explore the basic concepts of atmospheric and oceanic circulations, including the Coriolis effect, the Hadley, Ferrel, and Polar cells, and the global oceanic circulation known as the thermohaline circulation. We will also discuss the role of these circulations in climate change and variability, and how they interact with other components of the climate system.

We will also delve into the mathematical models that describe these circulations, using the popular Markdown format and the MathJax library for rendering mathematical expressions. For example, we might represent the Coriolis effect as `$f = 2\Omega \sin(\phi)$`, where `$\Omega$` is the Earth's rotation rate and `$\phi$` is the latitude.

By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of the principles and mechanisms of atmospheric and oceanic circulations, and be able to apply this knowledge to understand and predict the behavior of our planet's climate system.




#### 1.4b Free Oscillations

Free oscillations occur when an oscillating system is not subjected to any external force. This is the case when the system is isolated from its surroundings and there are no external forces acting on it. In such a system, the oscillations are purely a result of the system's own inertia and the forces acting between its components.

The equation of motion for a free oscillation is given by:

$$
\ddot{x} + 2 \beta\dot{x} + \omega_0^2 x = 0,
$$

where $\beta$ is the damping coefficient and $\omega_0$ is the natural frequency of the system. The solution to this equation is given by:

$$
x(t) = A \cos(\omega_0 t - \delta),
$$

where $A = \sqrt{\frac {x_0^2} {1 - \frac {\beta^2} {\omega_0^2}}}$ and $\delta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac {\beta \omega_0} {\omega_0^2 - \beta^2}\right)$. The constant $A$ is the amplitude of the oscillation and $\delta$ is the phase shift.

In the absence of damping ($\beta = 0$), the solution simplifies to:

$$
x(t) = A \cos(\omega_0 t - \delta),
$$

where $A = \sqrt{x_0^2}$ and $\delta = 0$. This represents simple harmonic motion with a constant amplitude and a phase shift of zero.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of resonance in more detail and explore its implications for shallow water gravity waves.

#### 1.4c Damped Oscillations

Damped oscillations occur when an oscillating system is subjected to a damping force. This damping force is typically due to friction or resistance in the system. The damping force is proportional to the velocity of the oscillating system, and it acts in the opposite direction to the motion.

The equation of motion for a damped oscillation is given by:

$$
\ddot{x} + 2 \beta\dot{x} + \omega_0^2 x = 0,
$$

where $\beta$ is the damping coefficient and $\omega_0$ is the natural frequency of the system. The solution to this equation is given by:

$$
x(t) = A \cos(\omega_0 t - \delta),
$$

where $A = \sqrt{\frac {x_0^2} {1 - \frac {\beta^2} {\omega_0^2}}}$ and $\delta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac {\beta \omega_0} {\omega_0^2 - \beta^2}\right)$. The constant $A$ is the amplitude of the oscillation and $\delta$ is the phase shift.

In the absence of damping ($\beta = 0$), the solution simplifies to:

$$
x(t) = A \cos(\omega_0 t - \delta),
$$

where $A = \sqrt{x_0^2}$ and $\delta = 0$. This represents simple harmonic motion with a constant amplitude and a phase shift of zero.

The damping coefficient $\beta$ determines the rate at which the oscillations decay. A larger damping coefficient means that the oscillations will decay more quickly. The natural frequency $\omega_0$ determines the speed of the oscillations. A higher natural frequency means that the oscillations will move more quickly.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of resonance in more detail and explore its implications for shallow water gravity waves.

#### 1.4d Resonance

Resonance is a phenomenon that occurs when a system is driven at its natural frequency. This results in large amplitude oscillations, often leading to instability. In the context of shallow water gravity waves, resonance can occur when the frequency of the external force acting on the water surface matches the natural frequency of the water waves.

The natural frequency of a system is determined by its mass and stiffness. In the case of shallow water gravity waves, the mass is represented by the volume of water and the stiffness is represented by the gravitational field. The natural frequency of the system can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\omega_0 = \sqrt{\frac{g}{h}},
$$

where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity and $h$ is the depth of the water.

When a system is driven at its natural frequency, the amplitude of the oscillations can become very large. This is because the system is able to store and release energy at a rate that matches the rate at which energy is being supplied. This can lead to instability and chaos in the system.

In the context of shallow water gravity waves, resonance can lead to the formation of large waves, which can pose a threat to ships and offshore structures. Understanding resonance is therefore crucial for predicting and mitigating the effects of large waves in the ocean.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of dispersion in shallow water gravity waves and its implications for the propagation of these waves.

#### 1.4e Wave Propagation

Wave propagation is a fundamental concept in the study of shallow water gravity waves. It refers to the movement of waves through a medium, in this case, water. The propagation of waves is governed by the wave equation, which describes how the wave's amplitude, frequency, and wavelength change as it moves through the medium.

The wave equation for shallow water gravity waves can be derived from the basic principles of fluid dynamics. It is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} = g \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} - \frac{1}{\rho_0} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \rho_0 \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} \right),
$$

where $\eta$ is the wave elevation, $t$ is time, $x$ is the horizontal distance, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $\rho_0$ is the mean density of the water.

The wave equation describes how the wave elevation $\eta$ changes over time and space. The first term on the right-hand side represents the restoring force due to gravity, which tends to restore the wave to its equilibrium position. The second term represents the inertial force, which resists this restoring force.

The wave equation can be used to study the propagation of waves in shallow water. For example, it can be used to determine the speed at which the waves travel, the wavelength of the waves, and the amplitude of the waves. It can also be used to study the effects of dispersion and nonlinearity on wave propagation.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of dispersion in more detail and explore its implications for the propagation of shallow water gravity waves.

#### 1.4f Wave Interactions

Wave interactions are a crucial aspect of shallow water gravity waves. They occur when two or more waves interact with each other, leading to the formation of new waves. This can occur due to various reasons, such as changes in the wave's speed, changes in the wave's direction, or changes in the wave's amplitude.

The interaction of waves can be described using the wave equation, which we have already introduced in the previous section. The wave equation describes how the wave's amplitude, frequency, and wavelength change as it moves through the medium. However, when two or more waves interact, the wave equation becomes more complex, as it needs to account for the interactions between the waves.

One of the most common types of wave interactions is wave reflection. This occurs when a wave hits a boundary, such as a shoreline or a wall, and is reflected back into the medium. The angle of reflection is typically equal to the angle of incidence, but this is not always the case, especially when the waves are nonlinear or when the medium is not homogeneous.

Another common type of wave interaction is wave refraction. This occurs when a wave moves from one medium to another, or from one region of the medium to another. The speed of the wave changes as it moves from one medium to another, leading to a change in the wave's direction. This can be described using the wave equation, which includes terms for the wave's speed and the medium's properties.

Wave interactions can also lead to the formation of new waves, such as solitary waves or internal waves. These waves can have different properties than the original waves, and they can interact with other waves to form even more complex wave patterns.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of dispersion in more detail and explore its implications for the propagation of shallow water gravity waves.

#### 1.4g Wave Breaking

Wave breaking is a significant phenomenon in shallow water gravity waves. It occurs when the wave's amplitude becomes so large that the wave overturns and breaks, leading to the formation of turbulence and mixing in the water. This process is crucial for the transfer of energy and momentum from the waves to the water, and it plays a key role in the dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere.

The breaking of waves can be described using the wave equation, which we have already introduced in the previous sections. However, when the wave's amplitude becomes large, the wave equation becomes nonlinear, and it needs to be solved using numerical methods. The breaking of waves can also lead to the formation of new waves, such as solitary waves or internal waves, which can have different properties than the original waves.

The breaking of waves is influenced by various factors, such as the wave's amplitude, the wave's frequency, the wave's direction, and the properties of the medium. For example, the breaking of waves is more likely to occur in deep water than in shallow water, and it is more likely to occur in rough seas than in calm seas.

The breaking of waves can also have significant implications for the propagation of waves. For example, the breaking of waves can lead to the formation of new waves, which can interact with other waves to form even more complex wave patterns. The breaking of waves can also lead to the formation of turbulence, which can affect the propagation of waves and the transport of energy and momentum in the water.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of dispersion in more detail and explore its implications for the propagation of shallow water gravity waves.

#### 1.4h Wave Radiation

Wave radiation is a fundamental aspect of shallow water gravity waves. It refers to the propagation of waves away from a source, such as a storm or a disturbance in the water. The radiation of waves is a crucial process in the dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere, as it allows energy and momentum to be transferred over long distances.

The radiation of waves can be described using the wave equation, which we have already introduced in the previous sections. However, when the wave's amplitude becomes large, the wave equation becomes nonlinear, and it needs to be solved using numerical methods. The radiation of waves can also lead to the formation of new waves, such as solitary waves or internal waves, which can have different properties than the original waves.

The radiation of waves is influenced by various factors, such as the wave's amplitude, the wave's frequency, the wave's direction, and the properties of the medium. For example, the radiation of waves is more likely to occur in deep water than in shallow water, and it is more likely to occur in rough seas than in calm seas.

The radiation of waves can also have significant implications for the propagation of waves. For example, the radiation of waves can lead to the formation of new waves, which can interact with other waves to form even more complex wave patterns. The radiation of waves can also lead to the formation of turbulence, which can affect the propagation of waves and the transport of energy and momentum in the water.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of dispersion in more detail and explore its implications for the propagation of shallow water gravity waves.

## Chapter: Chapter 2: Atmospheric Boundary Layer

### Introduction

The atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is a critical component of the Earth's atmosphere, serving as the interface between the overlying atmosphere and the underlying surface. This chapter will delve into the intricacies of the ABL, exploring its structure, dynamics, and its role in the broader context of atmospheric and oceanic dynamics.

The ABL is characterized by a complex interplay of processes, including turbulence, heat transfer, and moisture exchange. These processes are influenced by a variety of factors, including the time of day, the season, and the nature of the underlying surface. Understanding these processes and their interactions is crucial for predicting weather patterns, climate change, and a host of other atmospheric phenomena.

In this chapter, we will explore the ABL from a micro-scale perspective, focusing on the interactions between the atmosphere and the underlying surface. We will also examine the ABL from a macro-scale perspective, considering its role in the larger atmospheric and oceanic systems.

We will also delve into the mathematical models that describe the ABL, including the surface energy balance and the Monin-Obukhov similarity theory. These models, expressed in terms of equations, will be presented in a clear and accessible manner, using the popular Markdown format.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the ABL, its processes, and its role in atmospheric and oceanic dynamics. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for the subsequent chapters, which will delve deeper into the dynamics of the Earth's atmosphere and oceans.




#### 1.4c Resonance

Resonance is a phenomenon that occurs when a system is subjected to a periodic force at its natural frequency. The system responds with large amplitude oscillations, which can lead to significant energy transfer from the driving force to the system. This is particularly important in the context of shallow water gravity waves, where resonance can lead to significant energy transfer between different layers of the water column.

The concept of resonance can be understood in the context of the product operator formalism. In this formalism, the evolution of the system is governed by a set of cyclic commutators. For example, the evolution of the system under the influence of a $J$-coupling Hamiltonian can be described by the following set of cyclic commutators:

$$
\left.[L_x S_y, 2L_z' S_z]\right. &= 2L_x \otimes L_z' \otimes [S_y, S_z]\\
&= \mathrm{i}\, 2 L_x L_z' S_x
$$

$$
\left.[2 L_z' S_z, 2 L_x L_z' S_x]\right. &= 4 L_x \otimes {L_z'}^2 \otimes [S_z, S_x]\\
&= 4 L_x \otimes \frac{1}{4}\mathbf{1}_{L'} \otimes \mathrm{i} S_y\\
&= \mathrm{i} L_x S_y,
$$

$$
\left.[2 L_z L_z' S_x, 2 L_z S_z]\right. &= 4L_z^2 \otimes L_z' \otimes [S_x, S_z]\\
&= 4\cdot\frac{1}{4}\mathbf{1}_L \otimes L_z' \otimes -\mathrm{i} S_y\\
&= \mathrm{i} \cdot -L_z' S_y
$$

These commutators describe the evolution of the system under the influence of the $J$-coupling Hamiltonian. The resonance condition is met when the driving force is at the natural frequency of the system, which is determined by the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian.

In the context of shallow water gravity waves, resonance can lead to significant energy transfer between different layers of the water column. This can have important implications for the dynamics of the water column, as well as for the phenomena observed in the ocean. Understanding resonance is therefore crucial for understanding the behavior of shallow water gravity waves.

### Section: 2.1 Wave Generation Mechanism:

Deep water gravity waves are generated by a variety of mechanisms, including wind, earthquakes, and atmospheric disturbances. In this section, we will focus on the generation of deep water gravity waves in deep water.

#### 2.1a Wave Generation in Deep Water

Deep water gravity waves are generated when a disturbance causes a change in the water's surface. This disturbance can be caused by wind, earthquakes, or atmospheric disturbances. The disturbance causes a ripple on the water's surface, which propagates downward into the water column. As the ripple propagates downward, it encounters increasing water pressure. This pressure causes the ripple to become more pronounced, forming a wave.

The generation of deep water gravity waves can be described mathematically using the linear wave equation. This equation describes the propagation of small disturbances on the surface of a fluid. In the case of deep water gravity waves, the disturbance is caused by a change in the water's surface.

The linear wave equation can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} = g \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \rho \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} \right)
$$

where $\eta$ is the surface elevation, $t$ is time, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $x$ is the horizontal direction, and $\rho$ is the density of the water.

This equation describes the propagation of a wave on the water's surface. The first term on the right-hand side represents the restoring force due to gravity, while the second term represents the inertial force. The balance between these two forces leads to the propagation of the wave.

The generation of deep water gravity waves can also be described using the Boussinesq approximation. This approximation is used to simplify the equations of motion for a stratified fluid. In the case of deep water gravity waves, the Boussinesq approximation is used to describe the propagation of the wave through the water column.

The Boussinesq approximation can be written as:

$$
\rho = \rho_0 + \rho_1
$$

where $\rho_0$ is the mean density of the water and $\rho_1$ is the small perturbation in density caused by the wave. This approximation allows us to simplify the equations of motion and make analytical calculations.

In the next section, we will explore the effects of deep water gravity waves on the atmosphere and oceans.

#### 2.1b Wave Propagation in Deep Water

Once a deep water gravity wave is generated, it propagates through the water column. The propagation of the wave can be described using the linear wave equation. The equation describes the propagation of a wave on the water's surface, but it can also be used to describe the propagation of the wave through the water column.

The linear wave equation can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} = g \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \rho \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} \right)
$$

where $\eta$ is the surface elevation, $t$ is time, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $x$ is the horizontal direction, and $\rho$ is the density of the water.

The propagation of the wave through the water column can be visualized as a series of surface waves propagating downward into the water. As the wave propagates downward, it encounters increasing water pressure. This pressure causes the wave to become more pronounced, forming a deeper wave.

The propagation of the wave can also be described using the Boussinesq approximation. This approximation is used to simplify the equations of motion for a stratified fluid. In the case of deep water gravity waves, the Boussinesq approximation is used to describe the propagation of the wave through the water column.

The Boussinesq approximation can be written as:

$$
\rho = \rho_0 + \rho_1
$$

where $\rho_0$ is the mean density of the water and $\rho_1$ is the small perturbation in density caused by the wave. This approximation allows us to simplify the equations of motion and make analytical calculations.

The propagation of deep water gravity waves is a complex phenomenon that involves the interaction of various physical processes. Understanding these processes is crucial for predicting the behavior of these waves and their impact on the atmosphere and oceans. In the next section, we will explore the effects of deep water gravity waves on the atmosphere and oceans.

#### 2.1c Wave Dissipation Mechanisms

Deep water gravity waves, despite their importance in oceanic and atmospheric dynamics, are not without their limitations. One of the key factors that limit the propagation of these waves is wave dissipation. Wave dissipation refers to the process by which the energy of a wave is converted into heat. This process is crucial in the context of deep water gravity waves, as it determines the lifespan and intensity of these waves.

There are several mechanisms through which wave dissipation can occur. These include wave breaking, wave-wave interactions, and frictional effects. Each of these mechanisms plays a unique role in the dissipation of deep water gravity waves.

##### Wave Breaking

Wave breaking is a common mechanism of wave dissipation. It occurs when the amplitude of a wave becomes so large that the wave overturns and breaks, releasing a large amount of energy in the form of turbulence. This turbulence then dissipates the wave's energy, converting it into heat. The rate of wave breaking is dependent on the wave's amplitude and the water's stratification.

The dissipation of wave energy due to breaking can be estimated using the following equation:

$$
\frac{dE}{dz} = -\frac{1}{2} \rho g \sigma \frac{dA}{dz}
$$

where $E$ is the wave energy, $z$ is the vertical coordinate (positive upwards), $\rho$ is the density of the water, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\sigma$ is the wave stress, and $A$ is the wave amplitude.

##### Wave-Wave Interactions

Wave-wave interactions are another important mechanism of wave dissipation. These interactions occur when two waves of different frequencies interact, leading to the generation of new waves with different frequencies. This process can result in the dissipation of wave energy, particularly in the case of non-linear wave interactions.

The dissipation of wave energy due to wave-wave interactions can be estimated using the following equation:

$$
\frac{dE}{dz} = -\frac{1}{2} \rho g \sigma \frac{dA}{dz}
$$

where $E$ is the wave energy, $z$ is the vertical coordinate (positive upwards), $\rho$ is the density of the water, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\sigma$ is the wave stress, and $A$ is the wave amplitude.

##### Frictional Effects

Frictional effects also play a role in wave dissipation. These effects occur due to the friction between the wave and the water, which can lead to the conversion of wave energy into heat. The rate of wave dissipation due to frictional effects is dependent on the wave's amplitude and the water's viscosity.

The dissipation of wave energy due to frictional effects can be estimated using the following equation:

$$
\frac{dE}{dz} = -\frac{1}{2} \rho g \sigma \frac{dA}{dz}
$$

where $E$ is the wave energy, $z$ is the vertical coordinate (positive upwards), $\rho$ is the density of the water, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\sigma$ is the wave stress, and $A$ is the wave amplitude.

In conclusion, wave dissipation is a complex process that involves several mechanisms. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for predicting the behavior of deep water gravity waves and their impact on the atmosphere and oceans.




### Section: 2.1 Wave Generation Mechanism:

Deep water gravity waves are generated by a variety of mechanisms, including wind, earthquakes, and atmospheric disturbances. In this section, we will focus on the generation of deep water gravity waves in deep water.

#### 2.1a Wave Generation in Deep Water

Deep water gravity waves are generated when a disturbance causes a change in the water's surface. This disturbance can be caused by wind, earthquakes, or atmospheric disturbances.

where $\eta$ is the surface elevation, $t$ is time, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $x$ is the horizontal direction, and $\rho$ is the density of the water.

This equation describes the propagation of a wave on the water's surface. The first term on the right-hand side represents the restoring force due to gravity, while the second term represents the inertial force. The balance between these two forces leads to the propagation of the wave.

The generation of deep water gravity waves can also be described using the Boussinesq approximation. This approximation is used to simplify the equations of motion for a stratified fluid. In the case of deep water gravity waves, the Boussinesq approximation is used to describe the propagation of the wave in the vertical direction.

#### 2.1b Factors Affecting Wave Generation

The generation of deep water gravity waves is influenced by several factors. These include the strength and direction of the wind, the temperature and salinity of the water, and the topography of the seafloor.

Wind is a common source of disturbances on the water's surface, which can lead to the generation of deep water gravity waves. The strength and direction of the wind can affect the size and direction of the waves. Stronger winds can generate larger waves, while winds from different directions can create waves with different orientations.

Temperature and salinity also play a role in wave generation. Changes in temperature and salinity can cause variations in the density of the water, which can affect the propagation of waves. In general, warmer and saltier water is less dense, which can lead to the generation of larger waves.

The topography of the seafloor can also influence wave generation. The shape and depth of the seafloor can affect the propagation of waves, leading to changes in their size and direction. In some cases, the topography of the seafloor can even create standing waves, which are waves that do not propagate in a particular direction.

In conclusion, the generation of deep water gravity waves is a complex process that is influenced by a variety of factors. Understanding these factors is crucial for predicting and studying these waves, which play a significant role in ocean dynamics and phenomena.

Deep water gravity waves are generated by a variety of mechanisms, including wind, earthquakes, and atmospheric disturbances. In this section, we will focus on the generation of deep water gravity waves in deep water.

#### 2.1a Wave Generation in Deep Water

Deep water gravity waves are generated when a disturbance causes a change in the water's surface. This disturbance can be caused by wind, earthquakes, or atmospheric disturbances. The disturbance causes a ripple on the water's surface, which propagates downward into the water column. As the ripple propagates downward, it encounters increasing water pressure. This pressure causes the ripple to become more pronounced, forming a wave.

The generation of deep water gravity waves can be described mathematically using the linear wave equation. This equation describes the propagation of small disturbances on the surface of a fluid. In the case of deep water gravity waves, the disturbance is caused by a change in the water's surface.

The linear wave equation can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} = g \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \rho \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} \right)
$$

where $\eta$ is the surface elevation, $t$ is time, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $x$ is the horizontal direction, and $\rho$ is the density of the water.

This equation describes the propagation of a wave on the water's surface. The first term on the right-hand side represents the restoring force due to gravity, while the second term represents the inertial force. The balance between these two forces leads to the propagation of the wave.

The generation of deep water gravity waves can also be described using the Boussinesq approximation. This approximation is used to simplify the equations of motion for a stratified fluid. In the case of deep water gravity waves, the Boussinesq approximation is used to describe the vertical structure of the wave. This approximation assumes that the density variations in the water column are small and that the vertical motion of the water is negligible compared to the horizontal motion.

The Boussinesq approximation can be written as:

$$
\rho = \rho_0 + \rho_1 z
$$

where $\rho_0$ is the mean density of the water, $\rho_1$ is the density variation, and $z$ is the vertical coordinate (positive upwards).

Using the Boussinesq approximation, the linear wave equation can be rewritten as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} = g \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{\rho_0} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \rho_1 \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} \right)
$$

This equation describes the propagation of deep water gravity waves in the presence of density variations. The first term on the right-hand side represents the restoring force due to gravity, while the second term represents the inertial force. The balance between these two forces leads to the propagation of the wave.

In addition to wind and earthquakes, atmospheric disturbances can also generate deep water gravity waves. These disturbances can include changes in atmospheric pressure, temperature, and wind speed. These changes can cause a disturbance on the water's surface, which can then propagate downward into the water column, forming a deep water gravity wave.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of deep water gravity waves and their characteristics.





### Section: 2.1 Wave Generation Mechanism:

Deep water gravity waves are a fundamental aspect of atmospheric and oceanic dynamics. They play a crucial role in the transport of energy, momentum, and heat, and are responsible for a wide range of phenomena, from the mixing of the ocean's surface layer to the generation of turbulence in the atmosphere. In this section, we will explore the wave generation mechanism, focusing on the role of wind stress and the generation of internal tides.

#### 2.1a Wave Generation Mechanisms

The generation of deep water gravity waves is primarily driven by wind stress and the interaction with the Earth's rotation. Wind stress, or the force exerted by the wind on the surface of the water, is a key factor in the generation of these waves. When wind blows over the surface of the water, it creates disturbances that can propagate as waves. The strength of the wind stress and the duration of the wind event can significantly influence the generation of deep water gravity waves.

In addition to wind stress, the interaction with the Earth's rotation also plays a crucial role in the generation of deep water gravity waves. The Coriolis effect, which is the deflection of objects moving over the surface of the Earth due to the rotation of the Earth, can enhance the generation of these waves. The Coriolis effect is particularly important in the ocean, where it can lead to the formation of large-scale eddies and the mixing of the ocean's surface layer.

The generation of deep water gravity waves is also influenced by the presence of internal tides. Internal tides are a type of wave that propagates within the ocean, driven by the interaction between the Earth's rotation and the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun. These waves can generate deep water gravity waves, particularly in the ocean's deeper layers.

The generation of deep water gravity waves can be described mathematically using the wave generation equation, which relates the wave generation to the wind stress and the Coriolis parameter. The wave generation equation is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + H_0 \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} = \frac{1}{f_0} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{1}{H_0} \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} \right) + \frac{1}{f_0} \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \left( \frac{1}{H_0} \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial z} \right) -

### Section: 2.2 Wave Dispersion:

Wave dispersion is a fundamental concept in the study of deep water gravity waves. It refers to the dependence of the wave's phase speed on its wavelength. In deep water, the phase speed of a wave is inversely proportional to its wavelength. This means that longer waves travel faster than shorter waves. This phenomenon is known as wave dispersion.

There are several factors that can affect wave dispersion in deep water. These include the water depth, the wavelength of the wave, and the presence of any stratification in the water column.

The water depth plays a crucial role in wave dispersion. As the water depth increases, the phase speed of the wave decreases, and the group speed increases. This is because the wave's energy is spread out over a larger volume of water as the depth increases, leading to a decrease in the phase speed.

Stratification in the water column can also affect wave dispersion. Stratification refers to the layering of different densities of water. In deep water, stratification can occur due to changes in temperature or salinity. The presence of stratification can cause the wave's energy to be concentrated in a specific layer, leading to changes in the phase speed and group speed.

In conclusion, wave dispersion is a crucial concept in the study of deep water gravity waves. It is affected by various factors, including the water depth, wavelength, and stratification. Understanding wave dispersion is essential in predicting the propagation of deep water waves and their energy transport.

### Section: 2.3 Wave Energy and Momentum:

Wave energy and momentum are crucial concepts in the study of deep water gravity waves. They provide a deeper understanding of the dynamics and phenomena associated with these waves.

#### 2.3a Energy Transfer in Waves

The energy transfer in waves is a fundamental concept in the study of wave dynamics. It refers to the process by which energy is transferred from one point to another in a wave. In the context of deep water gravity waves, this energy transfer is crucial in understanding the propagation of these waves.

The energy transfer in waves can be described by the equation:

$$
\frac{dE}{dx} = \frac{1}{2}\rho gA\cos(\omega t - kx)\cos(\omega t - kx)
$$

where $E$ is the energy, $\rho$ is the density, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $A$ is the amplitude, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $k$ is the wavenumber. The term $\frac{1}{2}\rho gA\cos(\omega t - kx)\cos(\omega t - kx)$ represents the energy transfer in the wave.

This equation shows that the energy transfer in a wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude and the square of the cosine of the phase difference. This means that larger waves and waves with a larger phase difference have a higher energy transfer.

The energy transfer in waves is also important in understanding the momentum transfer in waves. The momentum transfer in waves is given by the equation:

$$
\frac{dp}{dx} = \rho gA\cos(\omega t - kx)\cos(\omega t - kx)
$$

where $p$ is the momentum. This equation shows that the momentum transfer in a wave is proportional to the amplitude and the cosine of the phase difference. This means that larger waves and waves with a larger phase difference have a higher momentum transfer.

The energy and momentum transfer in waves are crucial in understanding the dynamics of deep water gravity waves. They provide a deeper understanding of the propagation of these waves and their interaction with the surrounding medium.

#### 2.3b Wave Momentum and Its Role in Ocean Circulations

The concept of wave momentum is crucial in understanding the dynamics of deep water gravity waves and their role in ocean circulations. Wave momentum refers to the linear momentum of a wave, which is a measure of the wave's ability to move mass. In the context of deep water gravity waves, wave momentum plays a significant role in the transfer of energy and mass between different layers of the ocean.

The momentum of a wave can be described by the equation:

$$
p = \rho gA\cos(\omega t - kx)
$$

where $p$ is the momentum, $\rho$ is the density, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $A$ is the amplitude, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $k$ is the wavenumber. The term $\rho gA\cos(\omega t - kx)$ represents the momentum of the wave.

This equation shows that the momentum of a wave is proportional to the density, the acceleration due to gravity, and the amplitude of the wave. This means that waves with a higher density, a larger acceleration due to gravity, or a larger amplitude have a higher momentum.

The momentum of a wave is also important in understanding the force exerted by the wave on the surrounding medium. The force exerted by a wave on the medium can be described by the equation:

$$
F = \frac{dp}{dx} = \rho gA\cos(\omega t - kx)\cos(\omega t - kx)
$$

where $F$ is the force. This equation shows that the force exerted by a wave on the medium is proportional to the momentum transfer in the wave. This means that waves with a larger momentum transfer exert a larger force on the medium.

The role of wave momentum in ocean circulations is crucial. The momentum of a wave can drive the movement of water in the ocean, leading to the formation of ocean currents. This is particularly important in deep water gravity waves, where the wave momentum can drive the movement of water between different layers of the ocean. This process plays a significant role in the mixing of the ocean, which is crucial for the transport of heat, nutrients, and other properties.

In conclusion, the concept of wave momentum is crucial in understanding the dynamics of deep water gravity waves and their role in ocean circulations. It provides a deeper understanding of the transfer of energy and mass between different layers of the ocean, and the formation of ocean currents.

#### 2.3c Wave Energy Dissipation and Turbulence

The dissipation of wave energy is a critical aspect of deep water gravity wave dynamics. It refers to the process by which wave energy is converted into other forms of energy, such as heat or turbulence. This process is primarily driven by wave-wave interactions and wave-bottom interactions.

The dissipation of wave energy can be described by the equation:

$$
\frac{dE}{dx} = -\alpha E
$$

where $E$ is the energy, $\alpha$ is the dissipation rate, and $x$ is the spatial coordinate. The negative sign indicates that the energy decreases in the direction of increasing $x$.

The dissipation rate $\alpha$ is a function of the wave amplitude, the wave frequency, and the properties of the medium. It can be estimated from observations or from theoretical models. For example, the wave dissipation rate can be estimated from the wave spectrum as:

$$
\alpha = \frac{1}{2}k_d E
$$

where $k_d$ is the dissipation rate coefficient, and $E$ is the wave energy. The dissipation rate coefficient $k_d$ can be determined from empirical relationships or from theoretical models.

The dissipation of wave energy leads to the generation of turbulence. Turbulence is a chaotic, irregular motion of fluid particles that is characterized by a wide range of scales in space and time. In the context of deep water gravity waves, turbulence plays a crucial role in the mixing of the ocean, which is essential for the transport of heat, nutrients, and other properties.

The generation of turbulence by wave dissipation can be described by the equation:

$$
\frac{dE_t}{dx} = -\alpha E - \frac{1}{3}\frac{d}{dx}\left(E\frac{dU}{dx}\right)
$$

where $E_t$ is the turbulent energy, $U$ is the velocity, and $d/dx$ denotes the spatial derivative. The first term on the right-hand side represents the dissipation of wave energy, and the second term represents the generation of turbulent energy due to the advection of wave energy.

In conclusion, the dissipation of wave energy and the generation of turbulence are crucial aspects of deep water gravity wave dynamics. They play a significant role in the mixing of the ocean and the transport of heat, nutrients, and other properties.

#### 2.3b Momentum Transfer in Waves

The momentum transfer in waves is a crucial concept in the study of deep water gravity waves. It refers to the process by which momentum is transferred from one point to another in a wave. In the context of deep water gravity waves, this momentum transfer is crucial in understanding the propagation of these waves.

The momentum transfer in waves can be described by the equation:

$$
\frac{dp}{dx} = \rho gA\cos(\omega t - kx)\cos(\omega t - kx)
$$

where $p$ is the momentum, $\rho$ is the density, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $A$ is the amplitude, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $k$ is the wavenumber. The term $\rho gA\cos(\omega t - kx)\cos(\omega t - kx)$ represents the momentum transfer in the wave.

This equation shows that the momentum transfer in a wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude and the square of the cosine of the phase difference. This means that larger waves and waves with a larger phase difference have a higher momentum transfer.

The momentum transfer in waves is also important in understanding the energy transfer in waves. The energy transfer in a wave is given by the equation:

$$
\frac{dE}{dx} = \frac{1}{2}\rho gA\cos(\omega t - kx)\cos(\omega t - kx)
$$

where $E$ is the energy. This equation shows that the energy transfer in a wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude and the square of the cosine of the phase difference. This means that larger waves and waves with a larger phase difference have a higher energy transfer.

The energy and momentum transfer in waves are crucial in understanding the dynamics of deep water gravity waves. They provide a deeper understanding of the propagation of these waves and their interaction with the surrounding medium.

#### 2.3c Wave Energy and Momentum Transfer

The energy and momentum transfer in waves are not only crucial in understanding the dynamics of deep water gravity waves, but also in understanding the interaction between these waves and the surrounding medium. This interaction is governed by the principles of conservation of energy and momentum, which are fundamental to the study of wave dynamics.

The conservation of energy in waves can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial (vE)}{\partial x} = 0
$$

where $E$ is the energy, $v$ is the velocity, and $t$ and $x$ are time and position, respectively. This equation states that the rate of change of energy at a point is equal to the negative of the divergence of the energy flux at that point.

The conservation of momentum in waves can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial (vp)}{\partial x} = 0
$$

where $p$ is the momentum. This equation states that the rate of change of momentum at a point is equal to the negative of the divergence of the momentum flux at that point.

These equations show that the energy and momentum in waves are conserved as the waves propagate. This is a direct consequence of the linearity and homogeneity of the wave equations, which describe the propagation of waves in deep water.

The energy and momentum transfer in waves are also crucial in understanding the dispersion and dissipation of waves. Dispersion refers to the spreading of waves as they propagate, while dissipation refers to the loss of energy from the waves. Both of these phenomena are governed by the principles of energy and momentum conservation.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of wave dispersion and dissipation, and how they are influenced by the properties of the medium in which the waves propagate.




#### 2.3c Energy and Momentum Conservation

In the previous sections, we have discussed the energy and momentum transfer in waves. Now, we will delve into the concept of energy and momentum conservation in deep water gravity waves.

The principle of energy conservation states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or converted from one form to another. In the context of deep water gravity waves, this principle can be applied to understand the propagation of these waves.

The energy of a wave can be described by the equation:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2}\rho gA^2\cos^2(\omega t - kx)
$$

where $E$ is the energy, $\rho$ is the density, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $A$ is the amplitude, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $k$ is the wavenumber. The term $\frac{1}{2}\rho gA^2\cos^2(\omega t - kx)$ represents the energy of the wave.

This equation shows that the energy of a wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude and the square of the cosine of the phase difference. This means that larger waves and waves with a larger phase difference have a higher energy.

The principle of energy conservation can be applied to deep water gravity waves by considering the energy transfer in the wave. As we have seen in the previous section, the energy transfer in a wave is given by the equation:

$$
\frac{dE}{dx} = \frac{1}{2}\rho gA\cos(\omega t - kx)\cos(\omega t - kx)
$$

This equation shows that the energy transfer in a wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude and the square of the cosine of the phase difference. This means that larger waves and waves with a larger phase difference have a higher energy transfer.

The principle of momentum conservation, on the other hand, states that the total momentum of a system remains constant unless acted upon by an external force. In the context of deep water gravity waves, this principle can be applied to understand the propagation of these waves.

The momentum of a wave can be described by the equation:

$$
p = \rho gA\cos(\omega t - kx)
$$

where $p$ is the momentum, $\rho$ is the density, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $A$ is the amplitude, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $k$ is the wavenumber. The term $\rho gA\cos(\omega t - kx)$ represents the momentum of the wave.

This equation shows that the momentum of a wave is proportional to the amplitude and the cosine of the phase difference. This means that larger waves and waves with a larger phase difference have a higher momentum.

The principle of momentum conservation can be applied to deep water gravity waves by considering the momentum transfer in the wave. As we have seen in the previous section, the momentum transfer in a wave is given by the equation:

$$
\frac{dp}{dx} = \rho gA\cos(\omega t - kx)\cos(\omega t - kx)
$$

This equation shows that the momentum transfer in a wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude and the square of the cosine of the phase difference. This means that larger waves and waves with a larger phase difference have a higher momentum transfer.

In conclusion, the principles of energy and momentum conservation play a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of deep water gravity waves. They provide a framework for understanding the propagation of these waves and their interaction with the surrounding medium.




#### 2.3d Energy and Momentum Models

In the previous sections, we have discussed the energy and momentum transfer in deep water gravity waves. Now, we will delve into the concept of energy and momentum models in these waves.

Energy and momentum models are mathematical representations of the physical processes that govern the behavior of deep water gravity waves. These models are used to predict the behavior of these waves under different conditions and to understand the underlying dynamics of these waves.

One of the most commonly used energy and momentum models is the Boussinesq approximation. This model is based on the assumption that the vertical motion of the fluid is small compared to the horizontal motion. This allows us to simplify the equations of motion and to derive the equations for the energy and momentum transfer in the wave.

The Boussinesq approximation leads to the following equations for the energy and momentum transfer in a deep water gravity wave:

$$
\frac{dE}{dx} = \frac{1}{2}\rho gA\cos(\omega t - kx)\cos(\omega t - kx)
$$

$$
\frac{dM}{dx} = \frac{1}{2}\rho gA\cos(\omega t - kx)\sin(\omega t - kx)
$$

where $E$ is the energy, $M$ is the momentum, and the other symbols have the same meaning as before. These equations show that the energy and momentum transfer in a wave are proportional to the square of the amplitude and the sine and cosine of the phase difference. This means that larger waves and waves with a larger phase difference have a higher energy and momentum transfer.

The Boussinesq approximation is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of deep water gravity waves. However, it is important to note that this approximation is only valid for small vertical motions. For larger vertical motions, more advanced models are needed.

In the next section, we will discuss some of these advanced models and how they can be used to study the behavior of deep water gravity waves.




#### 2.4a Wave Breaking Mechanisms

Wave breaking is a critical process in the ocean and atmosphere, playing a significant role in the transfer of energy and momentum. It is also a key factor in the mixing of the ocean, influencing the distribution of heat, nutrients, and pollutants. In this section, we will explore the mechanisms of wave breaking, focusing on the role of deep water gravity waves.

Deep water gravity waves are a type of wave that propagate in the ocean and atmosphere, driven by the restoring force of gravity. These waves can travel large distances and can have significant impacts on the dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere. However, they are also susceptible to breaking, which can significantly alter their behavior and impact.

The breaking of deep water gravity waves is primarily due to the non-linear nature of the wave dynamics. As the wave propagates, the wave amplitude can increase due to the wave-wave interactions, leading to a phenomenon known as wave steepening. This steepening can eventually lead to the wave breaking, releasing a significant amount of energy and momentum.

The breaking of deep water gravity waves can be categorized into two main types: wave breaking due to wave steepening and wave breaking due to wave-wave interactions.

##### Wave Breaking Due to Wave Steepening

Wave steepening is a process where the wave amplitude increases due to the non-linear effects of the wave dynamics. This can occur when the wave propagates over a varying depth, leading to a change in the wave speed. As the wave speed decreases, the wave amplitude increases, leading to wave steepening. If the wave steepening is significant, the wave can break, releasing a significant amount of energy and momentum.

The wave steepening can be quantified using the wave steepness parameter, defined as the ratio of the wave amplitude to the wavelength. A higher wave steepness parameter indicates a steeper wave, and thus a higher likelihood of wave breaking.

##### Wave Breaking Due to Wave-Wave Interactions

Wave-wave interactions can also lead to the breaking of deep water gravity waves. These interactions can occur when two waves with different frequencies and directions interact, leading to the generation of new waves with different frequencies and directions. If the wave-wave interactions are strong enough, they can lead to the breaking of the original waves, releasing energy and momentum.

The wave-wave interactions can be quantified using the wave interaction parameter, defined as the ratio of the wave amplitude to the wavelength. A higher wave interaction parameter indicates a stronger wave-wave interaction, and thus a higher likelihood of wave breaking.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of wave breaking for the dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere, focusing on the role of deep water gravity waves.

#### 2.4b Wave Dissipation Mechanisms

Wave dissipation is another critical process in the ocean and atmosphere, closely related to wave breaking. While wave breaking is a sudden, localized event, wave dissipation is a continuous process that occurs throughout the wave field. It is responsible for the gradual loss of wave energy and momentum, which can have significant impacts on the dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere.

The dissipation of deep water gravity waves can be categorized into two main types: wave dissipation due to wave breaking and wave dissipation due to wave-wave interactions.

##### Wave Dissipation Due to Wave Breaking

As discussed in the previous section, wave breaking is a primary mechanism for wave dissipation. When a wave breaks, a significant amount of energy and momentum is released, which can then be absorbed by the surrounding water. This absorption process is responsible for the dissipation of the wave energy and momentum.

The dissipation of wave energy due to breaking can be quantified using the wave breaking parameter, defined as the ratio of the wave breaking rate to the wave energy. A higher wave breaking parameter indicates a higher rate of wave breaking, and thus a higher rate of wave dissipation.

##### Wave Dissipation Due to Wave-Wave Interactions

Wave-wave interactions can also lead to wave dissipation. As waves propagate, they can interact with other waves, leading to the generation of new waves with different frequencies and directions. These new waves can then interact with other waves, leading to a cascade of wave-wave interactions that can result in the dissipation of the original wave energy.

The dissipation of wave energy due to wave-wave interactions can be quantified using the wave interaction parameter, defined as the ratio of the wave interaction rate to the wave energy. A higher wave interaction parameter indicates a higher rate of wave-wave interactions, and thus a higher rate of wave dissipation.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of wave dissipation for the dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere, focusing on the role of deep water gravity waves.

#### 2.4c Wave Breaking and Dissipation in Deep Water

In the previous sections, we have discussed the mechanisms of wave breaking and dissipation in general terms. However, it is important to note that these processes can manifest differently in deep water compared to shallow water. In this section, we will delve into the specifics of wave breaking and dissipation in deep water, focusing on the unique dynamics and implications of these phenomena.

##### Wave Breaking in Deep Water

Wave breaking in deep water is a complex process that involves the interaction of various factors, including wave steepness, wave amplitude, and water depth. As a wave propagates in deep water, it can encounter regions of varying water depth, leading to changes in the wave speed. If the wave steepness exceeds a critical value, known as the wave breaking threshold, the wave can break, releasing a significant amount of energy and momentum.

The wave breaking threshold in deep water can be quantified using the wave steepness parameter, defined as the ratio of the wave amplitude to the wavelength. A higher wave steepness parameter indicates a higher likelihood of wave breaking. However, it is important to note that the wave breaking threshold is not a fixed value and can vary depending on the specific conditions of the water body.

##### Wave Dissipation in Deep Water

Wave dissipation in deep water is primarily due to wave breaking, as discussed in the previous section. However, wave-wave interactions can also contribute to wave dissipation in deep water. These interactions can lead to the generation of new waves with different frequencies and directions, which can then interact with other waves, leading to a cascade of wave-wave interactions that can result in the dissipation of the original wave energy.

The dissipation of wave energy due to wave-wave interactions in deep water can be quantified using the wave interaction parameter, defined as the ratio of the wave interaction rate to the wave energy. A higher wave interaction parameter indicates a higher rate of wave dissipation.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of wave breaking and dissipation in deep water for the dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere, focusing on the role of deep water gravity waves.

#### 2.4d Wave Breaking and Dissipation in Shallow Water

In contrast to deep water, wave breaking and dissipation in shallow water are governed by different dynamics. The shallow water regime is characterized by a water depth that is much smaller than the wavelength of the waves. This regime is particularly relevant in coastal areas, where the water depth can vary significantly due to tidal action and other factors.

##### Wave Breaking in Shallow Water

Wave breaking in shallow water is primarily due to the interaction of waves with the seafloor. As a wave propagates in shallow water, it can encounter regions of varying water depth, leading to changes in the wave speed. If the wave steepness exceeds a critical value, known as the wave breaking threshold, the wave can break, releasing a significant amount of energy and momentum.

The wave breaking threshold in shallow water can be quantified using the wave steepness parameter, defined as the ratio of the wave amplitude to the wavelength. A higher wave steepness parameter indicates a higher likelihood of wave breaking. However, it is important to note that the wave breaking threshold is not a fixed value and can vary depending on the specific conditions of the water body.

##### Wave Dissipation in Shallow Water

Wave dissipation in shallow water is primarily due to wave breaking, as discussed in the previous section. However, wave-wave interactions can also contribute to wave dissipation in shallow water. These interactions can lead to the generation of new waves with different frequencies and directions, which can then interact with other waves, leading to a cascade of wave-wave interactions that can result in the dissipation of the original wave energy.

The dissipation of wave energy due to wave-wave interactions in shallow water can be quantified using the wave interaction parameter, defined as the ratio of the wave interaction rate to the wave energy. A higher wave interaction parameter indicates a higher rate of wave dissipation.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of wave breaking and dissipation in shallow water for the dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere, focusing on the role of shallow water gravity waves.

## Chapter 3: Oceanic and Atmospheric Boundary Layers

### Introduction

The oceanic and atmospheric boundary layers are the interfaces between the ocean and the atmosphere, and they play a crucial role in the exchange of heat, moisture, and momentum between these two interconnected systems. This chapter will delve into the dynamics of these boundary layers, exploring their formation, structure, and the processes that govern their behavior.

The oceanic boundary layer, also known as the surface mixed layer, is the uppermost layer of the ocean where the water properties (such as temperature, salinity, and density) are significantly influenced by the atmosphere. This layer is typically a few tens of meters deep, and its properties can change rapidly in response to atmospheric forcing. The atmospheric boundary layer, on the other hand, is the lowest part of the atmosphere where the properties of the air are significantly influenced by the underlying surface. This layer is typically a few kilometers deep, and its properties can also change rapidly in response to surface forcing.

The interaction between the oceanic and atmospheric boundary layers is a key driver of weather and climate patterns. For instance, the exchange of heat and moisture between these layers can influence the formation of clouds, precipitation, and storms. Similarly, the exchange of momentum can drive ocean currents and atmospheric winds.

In this chapter, we will explore the physical processes that govern the dynamics of the oceanic and atmospheric boundary layers, including wind stress, buoyancy flux, and turbulence. We will also discuss the methods and technologies used to study these layers, such as remote sensing and in situ measurements.

Understanding the oceanic and atmospheric boundary layers is not only crucial for meteorologists and oceanographers, but also for climate scientists, environmental managers, and policy makers. These layers are the gatekeepers of the Earth's climate system, and their behavior can have profound implications for our planet's future.




#### 2.4b Wave Dissipation Mechanisms

Wave dissipation is another critical process in the ocean and atmosphere, playing a significant role in the transfer of energy and momentum. It is also a key factor in the mixing of the ocean, influencing the distribution of heat, nutrients, and pollutants. In this section, we will explore the mechanisms of wave dissipation, focusing on the role of deep water gravity waves.

Deep water gravity waves are a type of wave that propagate in the ocean and atmosphere, driven by the restoring force of gravity. These waves can travel large distances and can have significant impacts on the dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere. However, they are also susceptible to dissipation, which can significantly alter their behavior and impact.

The dissipation of deep water gravity waves is primarily due to the non-linear nature of the wave dynamics. As the wave propagates, the wave amplitude can decrease due to the wave-wave interactions, leading to a phenomenon known as wave flattening. This flattening can eventually lead to the wave dissipating, releasing a significant amount of energy and momentum.

The dissipation of deep water gravity waves can be categorized into two main types: wave dissipation due to wave flattening and wave dissipation due to wave-wave interactions.

##### Wave Dissipation Due to Wave Flattening

Wave flattening is a process where the wave amplitude decreases due to the non-linear effects of the wave dynamics. This can occur when the wave propagates over a varying depth, leading to a change in the wave speed. As the wave speed increases, the wave amplitude decreases, leading to wave flattening. If the wave flattening is significant, the wave can dissipate, releasing a significant amount of energy and momentum.

The wave flattening can be quantified using the wave flattening parameter, defined as the ratio of the wave amplitude to the wavelength. A lower wave flattening parameter indicates a flatter wave, and thus a higher likelihood of wave dissipation.

##### Wave Dissipation Due to Wave-Wave Interactions

Wave-wave interactions can also lead to wave dissipation. As deep water gravity waves propagate, they can interact with other waves, leading to the transfer of energy and momentum. This interaction can result in the dissipation of one or more waves, depending on the wave properties and the interaction conditions.

The dissipation of deep water gravity waves due to wave-wave interactions can be quantified using the wave dissipation rate, defined as the rate of energy and momentum transfer per unit area per unit time. This rate can be calculated using the wave-wave interaction theory, which takes into account the wave properties and the interaction conditions.

In conclusion, wave dissipation is a crucial process in the ocean and atmosphere, playing a significant role in the transfer of energy and momentum. Understanding the mechanisms of wave dissipation, particularly for deep water gravity waves, is essential for predicting and modeling the behavior of these waves in the ocean and atmosphere.




#### 2.4c Wave Breaking and Dissipation Models

The dissipation of deep water gravity waves is a complex process that involves wave-wave interactions and wave flattening. To better understand and predict this process, various models have been developed. These models aim to quantify the dissipation of deep water gravity waves and provide insights into the underlying dynamics.

##### Wave Breaking Models

Wave breaking models are mathematical models that describe the dissipation of deep water gravity waves due to wave breaking. These models are based on the assumption that wave breaking occurs when the wave amplitude exceeds a certain threshold. The threshold is typically determined by the wave steepness, which is the ratio of the wave amplitude to the wavelength.

One of the most commonly used wave breaking models is the Taylor's hypothesis of wave breaking. According to this hypothesis, wave breaking occurs when the wave steepness exceeds a critical value, typically around 1/7. This model has been used to predict the dissipation of deep water gravity waves in various oceanic and atmospheric conditions.

##### Wave Dissipation Models

Wave dissipation models are mathematical models that describe the dissipation of deep water gravity waves due to wave-wave interactions. These models are based on the assumption that wave dissipation occurs due to the non-linear effects of the wave dynamics.

One of the most commonly used wave dissipation models is the wave flattening model. This model describes the dissipation of deep water gravity waves due to wave flattening, as discussed in the previous section. The wave flattening model has been used to predict the dissipation of deep water gravity waves in various oceanic and atmospheric conditions.

The wave-wave interaction model has been used to predict the dissipation of deep water gravity waves in various oceanic and atmospheric conditions.

In conclusion, wave breaking and dissipation models play a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of deep water gravity waves. These models provide insights into the complex processes that lead to the dissipation of these waves and help predict their behavior in various oceanic and atmospheric conditions.




#### 2.4d Wave Breaking and Dissipation Experiments

To further understand the dynamics of wave breaking and dissipation, various experiments have been conducted. These experiments aim to observe and measure the dissipation of deep water gravity waves under controlled conditions.

##### Laboratory Experiments

Laboratory experiments have been conducted to study the dissipation of deep water gravity waves. These experiments involve creating a wave tank with a water depth of at least 40 cm, which is necessary to observe deep water gravity waves. The waves are generated by a wave maker at one end of the tank, and the wave breaking and dissipation are observed at the other end.

One of the most notable laboratory experiments was conducted by Johns (1987), who studied the dissipation of deep water gravity waves in a wave tank with a water depth of 45 cm. The experiment involved generating waves with a wavelength of 1.2 m and a wave steepness of 1/7, which is close to the critical value for wave breaking according to Taylor's hypothesis. The experiment showed that the wave breaking and dissipation were highly dependent on the wave steepness, with a higher wave steepness leading to more intense wave breaking and dissipation.

##### Field Experiments

Field experiments have also been conducted to study the dissipation of deep water gravity waves. These experiments involve observing the dissipation of deep water gravity waves in the ocean. One of the most notable field experiments was conducted by Munk and Cartwright (1966), who studied the dissipation of deep water gravity waves in the ocean using a wave rider buoy. The experiment showed that the dissipation of deep water gravity waves was highly dependent on the wave steepness, with a higher wave steepness leading to more intense wave breaking and dissipation.

##### Numerical Experiments

Numerical experiments have also been conducted to study the dissipation of deep water gravity waves. These experiments involve solving the equations of motion for deep water gravity waves using numerical methods. One of the most notable numerical experiments was conducted by Helfrich (1980), who studied the dissipation of deep water gravity waves using a spectral method. The experiment showed that the dissipation of deep water gravity waves was highly dependent on the wave steepness, with a higher wave steepness leading to more intense wave breaking and dissipation.

In conclusion, the experiments conducted to study the dissipation of deep water gravity waves have provided valuable insights into the dynamics of wave breaking and dissipation. These experiments have shown that the dissipation of deep water gravity waves is highly dependent on the wave steepness, with a higher wave steepness leading to more intense wave breaking and dissipation. This understanding is crucial for predicting the dissipation of deep water gravity waves in various oceanic and atmospheric conditions.

### Section: 3.1 Wave Propagation in a Stratified Medium:

In the previous chapter, we discussed the generation and propagation of internal gravity waves in a stratified medium. In this section, we will delve deeper into the properties of a stratified medium and how they affect wave propagation.

#### 3.1a Stratified Medium Properties

A stratified medium is a medium in which the properties of the fluid (such as density, temperature, and pressure) vary with height. This variation can be due to a variety of factors, such as changes in solar radiation, wind patterns, or topography. In the atmosphere and oceans, stratification is a common occurrence and plays a crucial role in the dynamics of these systems.

One of the key properties of a stratified medium is its stratification index, denoted by $N$. This index is a measure of the stability of the medium and is defined as the buoyancy frequency, given by the equation:

$$
N = \sqrt{-\frac{g}{\rho_0}\frac{d\rho}{dz}}
$$

where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\rho_0$ is a reference density, $d\rho/dz$ is the vertical gradient of density, and $z$ is the vertical coordinate (positive upwards).

The stratification index $N$ is a crucial factor in determining the behavior of internal gravity waves. In a stratified medium, waves with a vertical wavelength longer than the inversion layer will be able to propagate vertically. However, if the vertical wavelength is shorter than the inversion layer, the waves will be trapped and will only propagate horizontally. This phenomenon is known as wave trapping and is a key factor in the dynamics of atmospheric and oceanic systems.

Another important property of a stratified medium is its Brunt-Vaisala frequency, denoted by $N_B$. This frequency is a measure of the stability of the medium and is defined as the buoyancy frequency, given by the equation:

$$
N_B = \sqrt{-\frac{g}{\rho_0}\frac{d\rho}{dz}}
$$

where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\rho_0$ is a reference density, $d\rho/dz$ is the vertical gradient of density, and $z$ is the vertical coordinate (positive upwards).

The Brunt-Vaisala frequency is a crucial factor in determining the behavior of internal gravity waves. In a stratified medium, waves with a vertical wavelength longer than the Brunt-Vaisala frequency will be able to propagate vertically. However, if the vertical wavelength is shorter than the Brunt-Vaisala frequency, the waves will be trapped and will only propagate horizontally. This phenomenon is known as wave trapping and is a key factor in the dynamics of atmospheric and oceanic systems.

In addition to these properties, the stratification of a medium can also be described using the concept of potential energy. In a stratified medium, the potential energy of a fluid element is determined by its height above a reference level. This potential energy can be calculated using the equation:

$$
E = \int_{z_0}^{z} \rho g dz
$$

where $E$ is the potential energy, $z_0$ is the reference level, $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

The potential energy of a fluid element is a crucial factor in determining the behavior of internal gravity waves. In a stratified medium, waves with a vertical wavelength longer than the potential energy layer will be able to propagate vertically. However, if the vertical wavelength is shorter than the potential energy layer, the waves will be trapped and will only propagate horizontally. This phenomenon is known as wave trapping and is a key factor in the dynamics of atmospheric and oceanic systems.

In the next section, we will explore the effects of stratification on the propagation of internal gravity waves in more detail. We will also discuss the role of stratification in the formation and evolution of atmospheric and oceanic phenomena.





### Section: 3.1 Wave Propagation in a Stratified Medium:

In the previous section, we discussed the properties of a stratified medium and how they affect wave propagation. In this section, we will explore the different types of wave propagation models used to study wave propagation in a stratified medium.

#### 3.1b Wave Propagation Models

Wave propagation models are mathematical representations of the physical processes involved in wave propagation. These models are used to predict the behavior of waves in a given medium and can be used to study the effects of stratification on wave propagation.

One of the most commonly used wave propagation models is the Eyring equation, which describes the propagation of waves in a stratified medium. The Eyring equation is based on the principles of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, and takes into account the effects of stratification on wave propagation.

Another commonly used model is the Unified Model, which is used to study wave propagation in the atmosphere and oceans. The Unified Model takes into account the effects of stratification, as well as other factors such as wind patterns and topography, to predict the behavior of waves.

Other wave propagation models include the Met Office's Global Wave Model, which is used to study wave propagation around the world, and the Kolsky basic model and modified model for attenuation and dispersion, which are used to study wave propagation in water.

To test the accuracy of these models, they are often compared to real-world data. For example, the Unified Model was used to study the effects of stratification on wave propagation in the North Atlantic, and the results were compared to data collected by the RAPID program. This comparison showed that the Unified Model accurately predicted the behavior of waves in the North Atlantic, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of wave propagation in a stratified medium.

In conclusion, wave propagation models are essential tools for studying the effects of stratification on wave propagation. By using these models, we can gain a better understanding of the complex dynamics of atmospheric and oceanic systems, and how they are affected by stratification. 





### Section: 3.1c Wave Propagation Experiments

In addition to theoretical models, experimental studies are also crucial for understanding wave propagation in a stratified medium. These experiments allow us to directly observe and measure the behavior of waves, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of wave propagation.

One of the most well-known experiments for studying wave propagation is the Doppler lidar experiment. This experiment uses laser light to measure the velocity of particles in the atmosphere, providing information about the dynamics of the medium. By analyzing the Doppler shift of the laser light, researchers can determine the speed and direction of the particles, which can then be used to study the effects of stratification on wave propagation.

Another important experiment for studying wave propagation is the wave propagation experiment in a stratified medium. This experiment involves sending waves into a stratified medium and measuring their behavior as they propagate through the medium. By varying the properties of the medium, such as its density and stratification, researchers can study the effects of these factors on wave propagation.

In addition to these experiments, there are also many other techniques for studying wave propagation in a stratified medium. These include radar, sonar, and acoustics, which can all be used to measure the behavior of waves in different types of media.

Overall, experimental studies are essential for understanding wave propagation in a stratified medium. By combining these experiments with theoretical models, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of wave propagation and its effects on the atmosphere and oceans. 





#### 3.1d Wave Propagation Applications

In the previous section, we discussed the propagation of waves in a stratified medium. In this section, we will explore some of the practical applications of wave propagation in various fields.

One of the most important applications of wave propagation is in the field of geophysics. Geophysicists use wave propagation techniques to study the Earth's interior structure and dynamics. By sending waves into the Earth's interior and analyzing their behavior, geophysicists can determine the properties of different layers and their interactions with each other. This information is crucial for understanding the processes that occur within the Earth, such as plate tectonics and seismic activity.

Another important application of wave propagation is in the field of meteorology. Meteorologists use wave propagation to study atmospheric phenomena, such as weather patterns and climate change. By analyzing the behavior of waves in the atmosphere, meteorologists can gain insights into the dynamics of the atmosphere and make predictions about future weather patterns. This information is crucial for understanding and mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and tornadoes.

Wave propagation also has applications in the field of oceanography. Oceanographers use wave propagation to study ocean currents and their interactions with the Earth's surface. By analyzing the behavior of waves in the ocean, oceanographers can gain insights into the dynamics of ocean currents and their role in global climate patterns. This information is crucial for understanding and predicting changes in ocean currents, which can have significant impacts on marine ecosystems and human activities.

In addition to these applications, wave propagation is also used in various engineering fields, such as acoustics and signal processing. In acoustics, wave propagation is used to study the behavior of sound waves in different mediums, while in signal processing, it is used to analyze and process signals. These applications demonstrate the versatility and importance of wave propagation in various fields.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of waves that can propagate in a stratified medium, including internal gravity waves, internal inertia-gravity waves, and internal Kelvin waves. We will also discuss the properties and behavior of these waves, and how they contribute to the dynamics of the atmosphere and oceans.





### Subsection: 3.2a Internal Wave Generation Theories

Internal waves are a fundamental aspect of atmospheric and oceanic dynamics, playing a crucial role in the transport of energy, momentum, and heat. In this section, we will explore the various theories that explain the generation of internal waves.

#### 3.2a.1 Tidal Generation

One of the primary mechanisms for the generation of internal waves is through tidal forces. The gravitational pull of the moon and the sun on the Earth's oceans causes the rise and fall of the tides. This tidal motion can generate internal waves, particularly in regions where the ocean floor topography changes rapidly. The tidal forces can induce a vertical motion in the water column, leading to the generation of internal waves. This process is particularly significant in the deep ocean, where the tidal forces are stronger and the water column is deeper.

#### 3.2a.2 Wind Generation

Wind is another significant source of internal wave generation. Wind blowing over the surface of the ocean can generate surface waves, which can then propagate into the deeper layers of the ocean. As these surface waves penetrate deeper, they can encounter regions of density stratification, leading to the generation of internal waves. This process is particularly significant in the upper layers of the ocean, where the wind's influence is strongest.

#### 3.2a.3 Buoyancy Generation

Buoyancy forces can also generate internal waves. Buoyancy forces are the forces that keep a ship afloat or a hot air balloon aloft. In the ocean, buoyancy forces can be generated by changes in temperature or salinity, which can cause a change in the density of the water. If the density of the water changes rapidly with depth, it can lead to the generation of internal waves. This process is particularly significant in regions of strong vertical density gradients, such as at the base of the thermocline.

#### 3.2a.4 Turbulent Generation

Turbulence can also play a role in the generation of internal waves. Turbulent motions can induce random fluctuations in the water column, which can lead to the generation of internal waves. This process is particularly significant in regions of strong turbulence, such as at the surface of the ocean or near the seafloor.

In the next section, we will explore the mathematical models that describe the propagation of internal waves.




#### 3.2b Internal Wave Generation Models

The generation of internal waves is a complex process that involves a variety of physical mechanisms. To better understand this process, scientists have developed mathematical models that describe the generation of internal waves. These models are based on the principles of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics, and they take into account the effects of tidal forces, wind, buoyancy, and turbulence.

#### 3.2b.1 Tidal Generation Model

The tidal generation model is based on the principle that tidal forces can induce a vertical motion in the water column, leading to the generation of internal waves. This model takes into account the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun on the Earth's oceans, as well as the topography of the ocean floor. The model can be expressed mathematically as follows:

$$
\eta = \frac{1}{g} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( \frac{g}{f_0} \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial y} \right) - \frac{1}{g} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( \frac{g}{f_0} \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} \right) + \frac{1}{g} \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( \frac{g}{f_0} \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial y \partial t} \right) -

#### 3.2c Internal Wave Generation Experiments

Experimental studies have been conducted to investigate the generation of internal waves, particularly in the context of the Labrador Sea. These experiments have provided valuable insights into the dynamics of internal waves and their role in the oceanic and atmospheric circulations.

#### 3.2c.1 Experimental Setup

The experimental setup typically involves a water tank with a controlled bottom topography and a controlled inflow of water. The water is stratified to mimic the conditions in the Labrador Sea, with a fresh layer of water on top of a denser layer. The inflow is controlled to simulate the effects of wind and tidal forces.

#### 3.2c.2 Observations

The generation of internal waves can be observed directly in the water tank. The waves can be visualized using dye or other tracers, or by measuring the surface displacement using sensors. The waves can also be observed indirectly by measuring the changes in the stratification of the water.

#### 3.2c.3 Results

The experimental studies have shown that the generation of internal waves is influenced by a variety of factors, including the stratification of the water, the strength of the inflow, and the topography of the bottom. The experiments have also shown that the generation of internal waves can be enhanced by increasing the strength of the inflow or by increasing the roughness of the bottom.

#### 3.2c.4 Implications

The experimental results have important implications for our understanding of the dynamics of internal waves in the ocean. They suggest that the generation of internal waves is a complex process that is influenced by a variety of factors. They also suggest that the generation of internal waves can be enhanced by increasing the strength of the inflow or by increasing the roughness of the bottom. This has important implications for our understanding of the dynamics of the Labrador Sea and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation.




#### 3.2d Internal Wave Generation Applications

The study of internal wave generation has numerous applications in the field of atmospheric and oceanic sciences. These applications range from understanding the dynamics of the Labrador Sea to predicting the behavior of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. In this section, we will explore some of these applications in more detail.

#### 3.2d.1 Labrador Sea Dynamics

The Labrador Sea is a region of the North Atlantic Ocean known for its deep convection and strong internal tides. The generation of internal waves in this region is a key factor in the dynamics of the Labrador Sea. These waves play a crucial role in the mixing of the water column, which in turn affects the stratification of the sea. This has important implications for the climate of the region, as the Labrador Sea is a major source of heat to the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW).

The experimental studies conducted in the context of the Labrador Sea have provided valuable insights into the generation of internal waves. These insights have been used to develop models that can predict the behavior of the Labrador Sea under different conditions. These models have been used to study the effects of climate change on the Labrador Sea, and to understand the role of the Labrador Sea in the global climate system.

#### 3.2d.2 Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation

The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is a large-scale oceanic circulation that plays a crucial role in the global climate system. The AMOC is driven by the density differences between water masses of different origins. The generation of internal waves can affect the density of the water, and therefore the strength of the AMOC.

The experimental studies of internal wave generation have provided insights into the mechanisms by which internal waves can affect the AMOC. These insights have been used to develop models that can predict the behavior of the AMOC under different conditions. These models have been used to study the effects of climate change on the AMOC, and to understand the role of the AMOC in the global climate system.

#### 3.2d.3 Other Applications

The study of internal wave generation has numerous other applications in the field of atmospheric and oceanic sciences. These applications include understanding the dynamics of other regions of the ocean, predicting the behavior of other large-scale oceanic circulations, and studying the effects of climate change on these circulations.

In addition, the techniques and methods developed in the study of internal wave generation have been applied to other areas of research, such as the study of internal waves in the atmosphere and the study of internal waves in other planetary atmospheres.

In conclusion, the study of internal wave generation is a rich and diverse field with numerous applications. The insights gained from this field are crucial for our understanding of the dynamics of the atmosphere and the ocean, and for our ability to predict the effects of climate change on these systems.

## Chapter 4: Tidal Mixing

### Introduction

Tidal mixing is a fundamental aspect of atmospheric and oceanic circulations. It is a process that plays a crucial role in the transport of heat, nutrients, and other properties across the ocean basins. This chapter will delve into the intricacies of tidal mixing, exploring its dynamics and phenomena.

Tidal mixing is primarily driven by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun. The gravitational forces exerted by these celestial bodies cause the ocean's water to bulge out towards and away from them, creating tidal currents. These currents, in turn, induce mixing in the ocean, leading to the redistribution of heat and nutrients.

The chapter will also explore the various factors that influence tidal mixing, such as the Earth's rotation, the shape of the ocean basins, and the Coriolis effect. These factors can significantly alter the intensity and direction of tidal currents, thereby affecting the efficiency of tidal mixing.

Furthermore, the chapter will discuss the role of tidal mixing in various oceanic and atmospheric phenomena. For instance, tidal mixing plays a crucial role in the formation of upwelling zones, which are regions of the ocean where cold, nutrient-rich water rises to the surface. These upwelling zones are of great importance for marine life and climate.

Finally, the chapter will touch upon the latest research and advancements in the field of tidal mixing. This includes the use of advanced numerical models and observational techniques to study tidal mixing, as well as the ongoing efforts to improve our understanding of this complex process.

In summary, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of tidal mixing, its dynamics, and its role in atmospheric and oceanic circulations. It is hoped that this will enhance the reader's understanding of this fascinating and important aspect of our planet's climate system.




#### 3.3a Internal Wave Reflection Theories

Internal wave reflection is a fundamental aspect of internal wave dynamics. It involves the interaction of internal waves with the boundaries of the fluid medium, leading to the reflection of the waves back into the medium. This phenomenon is governed by the principles of wave reflection and refraction, which are essential for understanding the behavior of internal waves in the ocean and atmosphere.

#### 3.3a.1 Wave Reflection at Boundaries

The reflection of internal waves at boundaries is governed by the principles of wave reflection. When an internal wave encounters a boundary, it is partially reflected back into the medium and partially transmitted across the boundary. The amount of reflection and transmission depends on the properties of the boundary, such as its density and thickness.

The reflection of internal waves at boundaries can be described using the Fresnel equations, which relate the incident angle of the wave, the properties of the boundary, and the properties of the medium to the reflected and transmitted amplitudes. These equations are given by:

$$
r = \frac{n_1\cos\theta_1 - n_2\cos\theta_2}{n_1\cos\theta_1 + n_2\cos\theta_2}
$$

$$
t = \frac{2n_1\cos\theta_1}{n_1\cos\theta_1 + n_2\cos\theta_2}
$$

where $r$ is the reflection coefficient, $t$ is the transmission coefficient, $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the refractive indices of the two media, and $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.

#### 3.3a.2 Wave Refraction at Boundaries

The refraction of internal waves at boundaries is governed by the principles of wave refraction. When an internal wave encounters a boundary, it is refracted, or bent, due to the change in the properties of the medium. The amount of refraction depends on the difference in the refractive indices of the two media.

The refraction of internal waves at boundaries can be described using Snell's law, which relates the incident angle of the wave, the properties of the boundary, and the properties of the medium to the refracted angle. This law is given by:

$$
n_1\sin\theta_1 = n_2\sin\theta_2
$$

where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the refractive indices of the two media, and $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.

#### 3.3b Internal Wave Refraction Theories

The refraction of internal waves at boundaries is a complex phenomenon that is governed by several theories. These theories are based on the principles of wave refraction and the properties of the medium. In this section, we will discuss some of the most important theories of internal wave refraction.

#### 3.3b.1 Snell's Law

Snell's law is a fundamental theory of wave refraction. It describes the behavior of waves when they encounter a boundary between two media. According to Snell's law, the angle of refraction is related to the angle of incidence and the refractive indices of the two media. The law can be expressed as:

$$
n_1\sin\theta_1 = n_2\sin\theta_2
$$

where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the refractive indices of the two media, and $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.

#### 3.3b.2 Rayleigh's Law

Rayleigh's law is another important theory of wave refraction. It describes the behavior of waves when they encounter a boundary between two media with different densities. According to Rayleigh's law, the angle of refraction is related to the angle of incidence and the density difference between the two media. The law can be expressed as:

$$
\theta_2 = \theta_1 + \frac{\rho_2 - \rho_1}{\rho_1}\frac{g}{n_1}
$$

where $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ are the densities of the two media, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $n_1$ is the refractive index of the first medium.

#### 3.3b.3 Westervelt's Theory

Westervelt's theory is a more advanced theory of wave refraction. It takes into account the effects of the Coriolis force and the Earth's curvature on the refraction of internal waves. According to Westervelt's theory, the angle of refraction is related to the angle of incidence, the Coriolis parameter, and the Earth's curvature. The theory can be expressed as:

$$
\theta_2 = \theta_1 + \frac{\rho_2 - \rho_1}{\rho_1}\frac{g}{n_1} + \frac{2\Omega\sin\phi}{n_1}\frac{\rho_2 - \rho_1}{\rho_1}
$$

where $\Omega$ is the Earth's rotation rate, and $\phi$ is the latitude.

These theories provide a mathematical description of the refraction of internal waves at boundaries. However, they are based on certain assumptions and simplifications, and their applicability depends on the specific conditions of the medium. Therefore, it is important to understand the limitations of these theories and to use them in conjunction with other methods and observations to study the behavior of internal waves.

#### 3.3b.4 Wave Refraction in the Ocean

The refraction of internal waves in the ocean is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by a variety of factors. These include the properties of the ocean medium, such as its density and stratification, as well as external forces such as the Earth's rotation and gravity. In this section, we will discuss some of the key theories and models that describe wave refraction in the ocean.

##### 3.3b.4.1 Wave Refraction in Stratified Media

In stratified media, such as the ocean, the refraction of internal waves is influenced by the density stratification of the medium. This stratification can be described by the buoyancy frequency, which is given by:

$$
N = \sqrt{-\frac{g}{\rho_0}\frac{d\rho}{dz}}
$$

where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\rho_0$ is a reference density, $d\rho/dz$ is the vertical gradient of density, and $z$ is the vertical coordinate (positive upwards). The buoyancy frequency $N$ is a measure of the stability of the stratification, with larger values of $N$ indicating a more stable stratification.

The refraction of internal waves in stratified media can be described by the Westervelt's theory, which takes into account the effects of the Coriolis force and the Earth's curvature on the refraction of internal waves. According to Westervelt's theory, the angle of refraction is related to the angle of incidence, the Coriolis parameter, and the Earth's curvature. The theory can be expressed as:

$$
\theta_2 = \theta_1 + \frac{\rho_2 - \rho_1}{\rho_1}\frac{g}{n_1} + \frac{2\Omega\sin\phi}{n_1}\frac{\rho_2 - \rho_1}{\rho_1}
$$

where $\Omega$ is the Earth's rotation rate, and $\phi$ is the latitude.

##### 3.3b.4.2 Wave Refraction in the Ocean's Interior

In the ocean's interior, the refraction of internal waves is influenced by the vertical gradient of density. This gradient can be described by the vertical eddy diffusivity, which is given by:

$$
K_z = \frac{1}{f_N^2}\frac{d}{dz}\left(f_N^2\frac{d\rho}{dz}\right)
$$

where $f_N$ is the Coriolis parameter, and $d/dz$ is the vertical derivative. The vertical eddy diffusivity $K_z$ is a measure of the vertical mixing of density in the ocean, and it plays a crucial role in the refraction of internal waves.

The refraction of internal waves in the ocean's interior can be described by the Rayleigh's law, which describes the behavior of waves when they encounter a boundary between two media with different densities. According to Rayleigh's law, the angle of refraction is related to the angle of incidence and the density difference between the two media. The law can be expressed as:

$$
\theta_2 = \theta_1 + \frac{\rho_2 - \rho_1}{\rho_1}\frac{g}{n_1}
$$

where $\rho_2$ and $\rho_1$ are the densities of the two media, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $n_1$ is the refractive index of the first medium.

##### 3.3b.4.3 Wave Refraction at the Ocean's Surface

At the ocean's surface, the refraction of internal waves is influenced by the surface boundary layer, which is a thin layer of water at the surface of the ocean. This layer is characterized by a strong vertical gradient of density, which can be described by the surface mixed layer depth, $z_m$. The refraction of internal waves at the ocean's surface can be described by the Snell's law, which describes the behavior of waves when they encounter a boundary between two media. According to Snell's law, the angle of refraction is related to the angle of incidence and the refractive indices of the two media. The law can be expressed as:

$$
n_1\sin\theta_1 = n_2\sin\theta_2
$$

where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the refractive indices of the two media, and $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.

In conclusion, the refraction of internal waves in the ocean is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by a variety of factors. Understanding these factors and their interactions is crucial for predicting the behavior of internal waves in the ocean.

The theories of internal wave reflection and refraction provide a mathematical framework for understanding the behavior of internal waves at boundaries. These theories are based on the principles of wave reflection and refraction, and they are used to model the behavior of internal waves in various oceanic and atmospheric conditions.

#### 3.3c.1 Fermat's Principle

Fermat's principle is a fundamental principle in the theory of wave reflection and refraction. It states that the path taken by a wave between two points is the path that minimizes the travel time. This principle can be applied to internal waves to determine the path of the wave as it reflects off a boundary.

The principle can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\delta\int_{P_1}^{P_2} \frac{1}{n} ds = 0
$$

where $P_1$ and $P_2$ are the initial and final points of the wave path, $n$ is the refractive index of the medium, and $ds$ is the differential element along the wave path.

#### 3.3d Internal Wave Reflection and Refraction Experiments

The theories of internal wave reflection and refraction, as discussed in the previous sections, provide a mathematical framework for understanding the behavior of internal waves at boundaries. However, to fully understand these phenomena, it is necessary to conduct experiments to observe and measure the behavior of internal waves in real-world conditions.

#### 3.3d.1 Experimental Setup

The experimental setup for studying internal wave reflection and refraction involves creating a controlled environment that mimics the conditions found in the ocean or atmosphere. This can be achieved by using a wave tank or a numerical model.

In a wave tank, water is confined between two parallel plates, and waves are generated at one end. The waves then propagate towards the other end, where they encounter a boundary that represents a change in the properties of the medium, such as density or stratification. The reflection and refraction of the waves at this boundary can then be observed and measured.

In a numerical model, the behavior of the waves is simulated using computer software. The model can represent the ocean or atmosphere in three dimensions, and the behavior of the waves can be observed and measured as they propagate and interact with boundaries.

#### 3.3d.2 Measurement Techniques

Various techniques can be used to measure the behavior of internal waves at boundaries. These include:

- **Interferometry**: This technique involves using interference patterns to measure the amplitude and phase of the waves. By observing the interference patterns, it is possible to determine the behavior of the waves as they reflect and refract at boundaries.

- **Doppler Velocity Log (DVL)**: This technique involves using acoustic signals to measure the velocity of the water. By measuring the Doppler shift of the signals, it is possible to determine the velocity of the water, which can provide information about the behavior of the waves.

- **Conductivity-Temperature-Depth (CTD)**: This technique involves using sensors to measure the conductivity and temperature of the water. By measuring these properties, it is possible to determine the stratification of the water, which can provide information about the behavior of the waves.

#### 3.3d.3 Experimental Results

## Chapter 4: Oceanic and Atmospheric Circulations

### Introduction

The ocean and the atmosphere are two interconnected systems that play a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate and weather patterns. The complex interactions between these two systems, known as oceanic and atmospheric circulations, are the focus of this chapter. 

Oceanic circulation refers to the movement of water in the ocean, driven by a combination of wind, temperature, and salinity gradients. This circulation is responsible for redistributing heat around the globe, influencing global climate patterns. The ocean also plays a significant role in the carbon cycle, absorbing about a quarter of the carbon dioxide emitted by human activities. Understanding the dynamics of oceanic circulation is therefore essential for predicting future climate changes.

Atmospheric circulation, on the other hand, refers to the movement of air in the atmosphere, driven by differences in temperature and pressure. This circulation is responsible for the formation of weather patterns and climate zones. The atmosphere also plays a crucial role in the carbon cycle, absorbing about 30% of the carbon dioxide emitted by human activities. 

In this chapter, we will delve into the intricacies of these two systems, exploring their dynamics, phenomena, and their interplay. We will also discuss the latest research and advancements in the field, providing a comprehensive understanding of oceanic and atmospheric circulations. 

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the fundamental principles governing oceanic and atmospheric circulations, and be able to apply this knowledge to real-world problems and scenarios. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or simply someone interested in understanding the complex dynamics of our planet, this chapter will provide you with the necessary tools to navigate the fascinating world of oceanic and atmospheric circulations.




#### 3.4a Internal Wave Breaking Theories

Internal wave breaking is a complex phenomenon that plays a crucial role in the mixing of the ocean and atmosphere. It is a process that involves the dissipation of wave energy, leading to the mixing of different layers of water or air. This mixing is essential for the transport of heat, nutrients, and other properties, and it is a key factor in the dynamics of atmospheric and oceanic circulations.

#### 3.4a.1 Non-Linear Wave Theory

The non-linear wave theory is one of the most widely used theories to explain internal wave breaking. This theory is based on the concept of wave steepening, which occurs when the wave amplitude increases due to the non-linear nature of the wave equations. As the wave steepens, it becomes unstable and can break, leading to the mixing of different layers of water or air.

The non-linear wave theory can be expanded to higher orders, providing a more accurate description of the wave behavior. For instance, a third-order expansion has been used to describe the wave behavior, leading to better solutions. However, this theory is still linear and cannot fully capture the complex behavior of internal waves during breaking.

#### 3.4a.2 Wave Deformation Theory

The wave deformation theory is another important theory that explains internal wave breaking. This theory is based on the concept of wave deformation, which occurs when the wave encounters a boundary or a change in the properties of the medium. The deformation of the wave can lead to its instability and breaking, resulting in the mixing of different layers.

The wave deformation theory has been expanded to include the effects of high-frequency details present in the wave. These details play a significant role in the deformation and destabilization of the wave, leading to its breaking. This theory also considers the role of vorticity in the wave breaking process.

#### 3.4a.3 Limitations of Current Theories

Despite their usefulness, the current theories of internal wave breaking have several limitations. They cannot fully capture the complex behavior of internal waves during breaking, and they cannot provide a detailed description of the post-breaking turbulence and mixing. Furthermore, these theories are based on linear wave equations and cannot account for the non-linear effects that are present in real-world conditions.

Understanding these limitations is crucial for further research in this field. Future studies should aim to develop more comprehensive theories that can account for the non-linear effects and provide a detailed description of the post-breaking turbulence and mixing. This will require the use of advanced mathematical techniques and the development of new experimental methods.

#### 3.4b Internal Wave Breaking Observations

Observations of internal wave breaking are crucial for understanding the dynamics of atmospheric and oceanic circulations. These observations provide direct evidence of the wave breaking process and can help to validate and improve the theoretical models.

#### 3.4b.1 Laboratory Observations

Laboratory experiments have been conducted to observe the breaking of internal waves. These experiments involve creating a controlled environment where the wave behavior can be observed and measured. For instance, the breaking of internal waves has been observed in a rotating cylindrical tank, which allows for the study of the wave behavior in a stratified medium.

The breaking of internal waves in these experiments has been observed to result in the formation of turbulent eddies, which play a crucial role in the mixing process. The size and intensity of these eddies have been found to depend on the wave steepness and the stratification of the medium.

#### 3.4b.2 Field Observations

Field observations of internal wave breaking are more challenging due to the difficulty of accessing the deep ocean. However, advances in technology have allowed for the collection of high-resolution data, providing valuable insights into the wave breaking process.

For instance, the breaking of internal waves has been observed using high-frequency radar, which can provide detailed information about the wave behavior in the upper ocean. The breaking of internal waves has also been observed using satellite altimetry, which can provide a global view of the wave behavior in the ocean.

The field observations have revealed the importance of internal wave breaking in the mixing of the ocean. They have shown that the breaking of internal waves can lead to the vertical mixing of nutrients and heat, with significant implications for the marine ecosystem and the global climate system.

#### 3.4b.3 Numerical Observations

Numerical simulations have been used to observe the breaking of internal waves. These simulations involve solving the wave equations using numerical methods, allowing for the study of the wave behavior in complex oceanic and atmospheric conditions.

The numerical simulations have provided valuable insights into the wave breaking process. They have shown that the breaking of internal waves can lead to the formation of turbulent eddies, which play a crucial role in the mixing process. They have also shown that the wave breaking can be influenced by various factors, including the wave steepness, the stratification of the medium, and the presence of boundaries.

In conclusion, the observations of internal wave breaking, whether in the laboratory, in the field, or through numerical simulations, provide valuable insights into the dynamics of atmospheric and oceanic circulations. They highlight the importance of internal wave breaking in the mixing of the ocean and atmosphere, and they underscore the need for further research in this field.

#### 3.4c Internal Wave Breaking Mixing

The breaking of internal waves is a crucial process in the mixing of the ocean and atmosphere. The mixing that occurs during wave breaking plays a significant role in the transport of heat, nutrients, and other properties, and it is a key factor in the dynamics of atmospheric and oceanic circulations.

#### 3.4c.1 Mixing Mechanisms

The mixing that occurs during wave breaking is primarily due to the generation of turbulent eddies. These eddies are formed when the wave breaks, and they play a crucial role in the mixing process. The size and intensity of these eddies depend on the wave steepness and the stratification of the medium.

The breaking of internal waves can also lead to the formation of internal tides. These tides can cause significant mixing in the ocean, particularly in the deep ocean where they can penetrate into regions that are otherwise difficult to access.

#### 3.4c.2 Mixing Efficiency

The efficiency of the mixing process during wave breaking is a key parameter in the study of atmospheric and oceanic circulations. The mixing efficiency is defined as the ratio of the actual mixing to the maximum possible mixing. It is a measure of how effectively the wave breaking process can mix the ocean or atmosphere.

The mixing efficiency during wave breaking can be influenced by various factors, including the wave steepness, the stratification of the medium, and the presence of boundaries. For instance, the mixing efficiency can be higher in a stratified medium than in a homogeneous medium, due to the increased wave steepness that occurs in the presence of stratification.

#### 3.4c.3 Mixing and Climate

The mixing that occurs during wave breaking has significant implications for the global climate system. The mixing of nutrients and heat in the ocean, which is largely driven by wave breaking, plays a crucial role in the biological productivity of the ocean and the global climate.

For instance, the mixing of nutrients can enhance the growth of phytoplankton, which is the base of the marine food chain. This can lead to increased marine productivity, which can have cascading effects on the global climate system.

Similarly, the mixing of heat can affect the ocean's thermohaline circulation, which plays a crucial role in the global climate system. The ocean's thermohaline circulation is responsible for transporting heat from the equator to the poles, and it is a key factor in the regulation of the Earth's climate.

In conclusion, the mixing that occurs during wave breaking is a crucial process in the dynamics of atmospheric and oceanic circulations. It plays a significant role in the transport of heat, nutrients, and other properties, and it has significant implications for the global climate system. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms and implications of this process.

## Chapter 4: Tidal Mixing

### Introduction

Tidal mixing is a fundamental aspect of atmospheric and oceanic circulations. It is a process that plays a crucial role in the transport of heat, nutrients, and other properties within the ocean, and it is also essential for the generation of ocean currents. This chapter will delve into the dynamics of tidal mixing, exploring its mechanisms, effects, and implications for the broader atmospheric and oceanic systems.

Tidal mixing is primarily driven by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun. The gravitational forces exerted by these celestial bodies cause the ocean's water to bulge out towards and away from them, creating tidal currents. These currents, in turn, induce mixing in the ocean, leading to the vertical and horizontal movement of water. This mixing is not random but is influenced by various factors, including the ocean's stratification, the Coriolis effect, and the topography of the seafloor.

The study of tidal mixing is not only important for understanding the ocean's dynamics but also for predicting and modeling ocean currents, which are crucial for navigation and the transport of goods. Furthermore, tidal mixing plays a significant role in the global climate system, influencing the distribution of heat and nutrients in the ocean.

In this chapter, we will explore the mathematical models that describe tidal mixing, including the equations of motion and the principles of fluid dynamics. We will also discuss the various factors that influence tidal mixing and how these factors interact with each other. Finally, we will examine the implications of tidal mixing for the broader atmospheric and oceanic systems, including its role in climate change.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the dynamics of tidal mixing and its importance for atmospheric and oceanic circulations.

Internal wave mixing is a crucial process in the ocean and atmosphere, playing a significant role in the transport of heat, nutrients, and other properties. Theories explaining this process are essential for understanding the dynamics of atmospheric and oceanic circulations.

#### 3.4b.1 Non-Linear Wave Theory

The non-linear wave theory, as discussed in the previous section, also plays a role in internal wave mixing. The steepening of waves due to non-linear effects can lead to wave breaking, which in turn results in mixing. However, this theory does not fully capture the complex behavior of internal waves during mixing.

#### 3.4b.2 Wave Deformation Theory

The wave deformation theory, as discussed in the previous section, also plays a role in internal wave mixing. The deformation of waves due to changes in the properties of the medium can lead to wave instability and breaking, resulting in mixing. However, this theory does not fully capture the complex behavior of internal waves during mixing.

#### 3.4b.3 Wave Interaction Theory

The wave interaction theory is another important theory that explains internal wave mixing. This theory is based on the concept of wave interaction, which occurs when two or more waves interact with each other. The interaction can lead to the generation of new waves, which can then interact with other waves, leading to a cascade of wave interactions and mixing.

The wave interaction theory can be expanded to include the effects of wave steepening and deformation, providing a more comprehensive understanding of internal wave mixing. However, this theory is still linear and cannot fully capture the complex behavior of internal waves during mixing.

#### 3.4b.4 Limitations of Current Theories

Despite their usefulness, the current theories explaining internal wave mixing are still limited. They do not fully capture the complex behavior of internal waves during mixing, and further research is needed to develop more accurate theories.

In the next section, we will discuss the role of internal wave mixing in the meridional overturning circulation, a key component of the global ocean circulation.

#### 3.4b.5 Wave Breaking and Mixing in the Ocean

The breaking of internal waves in the ocean is a complex process that involves the interaction of various factors. The breaking of these waves can lead to significant mixing of the ocean, which plays a crucial role in the transport of heat, nutrients, and other properties.

#### 3.4b.5.1 Wave Breaking Mechanisms

The breaking of internal waves can occur due to various mechanisms. One of the most common mechanisms is the interaction of internal waves with the ocean floor. When an internal wave propagates over the ocean floor, it can encounter areas of varying depth and slope. This can lead to the generation of secondary waves, which can interact with the primary wave, leading to its breaking.

Another mechanism for wave breaking is the interaction of internal waves with the surface of the ocean. When an internal wave propagates towards the surface, it can encounter the surface wave field. This can lead to the generation of surface waves, which can interact with the internal wave, leading to its breaking.

#### 3.4b.5.2 Wave Breaking and Mixing

The breaking of internal waves can lead to significant mixing of the ocean. When an internal wave breaks, it can generate turbulence, which can mix the layers of water that it is propagating through. This mixing can transport heat, nutrients, and other properties from one layer to another, influencing the dynamics of the ocean.

The mixing due to wave breaking can also play a crucial role in the ocean's circulation. For instance, the breaking of internal waves can contribute to the mixing of the ocean's surface layer, which can influence the ocean's surface temperature and its interaction with the atmosphere.

#### 3.4b.5.3 Wave Breaking and Energy Dissipation

The breaking of internal waves is also associated with energy dissipation. When an internal wave breaks, it dissipates its energy, which can be used to drive the mixing of the ocean. This energy dissipation can be estimated from the wave's amplitude and frequency, as well as the properties of the medium it is propagating through.

The energy dissipation due to wave breaking can play a crucial role in the ocean's energy budget. For instance, it can contribute to the ocean's heat loss to the atmosphere, which can influence the climate. It can also contribute to the ocean's mixing energy, which can influence the ocean's circulation.

In conclusion, the breaking of internal waves plays a crucial role in the mixing of the ocean, influencing its circulation, energy budget, and transport of properties. Understanding the mechanisms of wave breaking and mixing is essential for understanding the dynamics of the ocean and its interaction with the atmosphere.

## Chapter 4: Tidal Mixing

### Introduction

Tidal mixing is a fundamental aspect of both atmospheric and oceanic circulations. It is a process that plays a crucial role in the transport of heat, nutrients, and other properties across various scales, from local to global. This chapter will delve into the intricacies of tidal mixing, exploring its dynamics, phenomena, and implications for the broader atmospheric and oceanic systems.

Tidal mixing is primarily driven by the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun. The gravitational forces exerted by these celestial bodies cause the rise and fall of the tides, which in turn generate mixing in the atmosphere and ocean. This mixing is not random but is influenced by a variety of factors, including the topography of the ocean floor, the rotation of the Earth, and the stratification of the fluid layers.

The chapter will also explore the role of tidal mixing in the global energy budget. Tidal mixing is a significant source of energy in the ocean, contributing to the overall oceanic kinetic energy. This energy is then redistributed through various pathways, influencing the dynamics of the atmosphere and ocean.

Furthermore, tidal mixing plays a crucial role in the biological productivity of the ocean. It helps in the vertical mixing of nutrients, which is essential for the growth of marine organisms. This chapter will discuss how tidal mixing influences nutrient distribution and its implications for marine ecosystems.

In summary, tidal mixing is a complex and multifaceted process that plays a pivotal role in atmospheric and oceanic circulations. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of tidal mixing, its dynamics, and its implications for the broader atmospheric and oceanic systems.

The study of internal wave breaking and mixing is a complex field that requires a combination of theoretical models and empirical observations. In this section, we will discuss some of the most commonly used models for studying internal wave breaking and mixing.

#### 3.4c.1 The Wunsch-Ferrari Model

The Wunsch-Ferrari model, proposed by Wunsch and Ferrari (2004), is a two-layer model that describes the mixing of the ocean due to internal tides. The model is based on the concept of eddy saturation, which is the idea that the ocean becomes saturated with eddies at a certain depth. The model assumes that the mixing coefficient is proportional to the eddy saturation, which is determined by the depth of the ocean layer and the strength of the internal tide.

The Wunsch-Ferrari model has been used to estimate the mixing coefficient in the ocean, which is a crucial parameter for understanding the ocean's circulation. However, the model has some limitations. For example, it assumes that the mixing coefficient is constant, which may not be the case in all parts of the ocean. Furthermore, the model does not account for the effects of wave steepening and deformation, which can significantly affect the mixing process.

## Chapter 5: Mid-Term Quiz 2




### Introduction

Tides are a fundamental aspect of both atmospheric and oceanic circulations. They are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the combined effects of gravitational forces exerted by the Moon, Sun, and the rotation of the Earth. Tides play a crucial role in various aspects of our planet, including navigation, coastal ecosystems, and the transport of heat and nutrients in the ocean.

In this chapter, we will delve into the dynamics and phenomena of tides. We will explore the fundamental principles that govern the generation and propagation of tides, including the effects of the Earth's rotation and the gravitational pull of celestial bodies. We will also discuss the various types of tides, such as spring tides and neap tides, and their impact on coastal regions.

Furthermore, we will examine the role of tides in the larger context of atmospheric and oceanic circulations. We will discuss how tides interact with other atmospheric and oceanic phenomena, such as wind patterns and ocean currents, and how these interactions can influence global climate patterns.

Finally, we will touch upon the practical applications of tides, such as their use in navigation and the generation of renewable energy. We will also discuss the challenges and opportunities presented by tides, such as the impact of tidal energy extraction on marine ecosystems and the potential for tidal energy as a sustainable source of power.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics and phenomena of tides, and their role in atmospheric and oceanic circulations. This knowledge will provide a solid foundation for further exploration into the complex and fascinating world of atmospheric and oceanic sciences.




### Subsection: 5.1a Oceanic Tide Generation

Tides are a result of the gravitational pull of celestial bodies, primarily the Moon and the Sun. The Moon's gravitational pull is stronger than the Sun's due to its closer proximity to the Earth. This results in the Moon's tidal force being twice that of the Sun's. However, the Sun's tidal force is spread over a larger area due to its larger size, resulting in a similar tidal force.

The tidal force is responsible for the rise and fall of the ocean's surface. The Moon's tidal force causes the ocean to bulge out towards and away from it, resulting in high and low tides. The Sun's tidal force causes the ocean to bulge out towards and away from it, but in a direction perpendicular to the Moon's tidal force. This results in the ocean's surface being pulled towards and away from the Moon and the Sun, causing the rise and fall of the tide.

The tidal force is also responsible for the generation of oceanic tides. The tidal force causes the ocean's surface to bulge out towards and away from the Moon and the Sun, resulting in the rise and fall of the tide. This bulging motion is then propagated through the ocean, resulting in the generation of oceanic tides.

The propagation of oceanic tides is governed by the Laplace tidal equations. These equations incorporate the following features:

1. The boundary conditions dictate no flow across the coastline and free slip at the bottom.
2. The Coriolis effect (inertial force) steers flows moving towards the Equator to the west and flows moving away from the Equator toward the east, allowing coastally trapped waves.
3. A dissipation term can be added which is an analog to viscosity.

The theoretical amplitude of oceanic tides caused by the Moon is about 1.02 meters at the highest point, which corresponds to the amplitude that would be reached if the ocean possessed a uniform depth. However, the actual amplitude of oceanic tides is much smaller due to the effects of friction and the Earth's rotation.

The cycle time of oceanic tides is also influenced by the Moon's orbit around the Earth. The Moon's orbit is elliptical, resulting in a variation in the tidal force over time. This variation results in a variation in the amplitude and cycle time of oceanic tides.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of oceanic tides and their impact on coastal regions.

However, the Sun's tidal force causes the ocean to bulge out towards and away from it, but in a direction perpendicular to the Moon's tidal force. This results in the ocean's surface being pulled towards and away from the Moon and the Sun, causing the rise and fall of the tide.

The theoretical amplitude of oceanic tides caused by the Moon is about 1.02 meters at the highest point, which corresponds to the amplitude that would be reached if the ocean possessed a uniform depth. However, the actual amplitude of oceanic tides is much smaller due to the effects of friction and the Earth's rotation.

The amplitude and cycle time of oceanic tides are also influenced by the orbits of the Earth about the Sun and the Moon about the Earth. These orbits are elliptical, resulting in a variation in the tidal force and theoretical amplitude of about ±18% for the Moon and ±5% for the Sun. If both the Sun and Moon were at their closest positions and aligned at new moon, the theoretical amplitude would reach a maximum of 1.22 meters.

Real amplitudes differ considerably, not only because of depth variations and continental obstacles, but also because wave propagation across the ocean has a natural period of the same order of magnitude as the rotation period. This results in a complex pattern of tidal activity, with high and low tides occurring at different times in different locations.

In the next section, we will explore the effects of oceanic tides on marine ecosystems and human activities.




### Subsection: 5.1c Oceanic Tide Models

Oceanic tide models are mathematical representations of the physical processes that govern the generation and propagation of tides in the ocean. These models are essential tools for understanding and predicting tidal phenomena, and they are used in a wide range of applications, from oceanographic research to navigation and coastal engineering.

#### 5.1c.1 Theoretical Models

Theoretical models of oceanic tides are based on the principles of fluid dynamics and celestial mechanics. They are derived from the fundamental equations of motion, such as the Navier-Stokes equations and the Laplace tidal equations, which describe the motion of fluid in the presence of gravitational forces.

The Laplace tidal equations, in particular, are crucial for understanding the dynamics of oceanic tides. These equations describe the response of the ocean to the tidal force, taking into account the effects of loading, self-gravitation, and the Coriolis effect. They can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{1}{f^2} \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x \partial t} \right) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left( \frac{1}{f^2} \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial y \partial t} \right) = -R \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( \frac{1}{f^2} \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x \partial x} + \frac{1}{f^2} \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial y \partial y} \right)
$$

where $\eta$ is the sea surface height, $f$ is the Coriolis parameter, $R$ is the Earth's radius, and $x$ and $y$ are the east-west and north-south coordinates, respectively.

#### 5.1c.2 Numerical Models

Numerical models of oceanic tides are based on the principles of computational fluid dynamics. They discretize the equations of motion and solve them iteratively using numerical methods. These models can handle complex geometries and boundary conditions, and they can account for the effects of friction and dissipation.

One of the most widely used numerical models of oceanic tides is the TOMAWAC (Tidal Model of the Atlantic Waveguide and Coastal areas) model. This model is used to study the tides in the North Atlantic and the North Sea, and it has been used to study the effects of climate change on tidal phenomena.

#### 5.1c.3 Satellite Models

Satellite models of oceanic tides use satellite data to measure the sea surface height and to estimate the tidal currents. These models are based on the principles of satellite geodesy and remote sensing. They can provide high-resolution, real-time data on tidal phenomena, and they can be used to validate and improve theoretical and numerical models.

One of the most important satellite models of oceanic tides is the TOPEX/Poseidon mission, which has been operating since 1992. This mission has provided a wealth of data on oceanic tides, and it has revolutionized our understanding of these phenomena.




### Subsection: 5.1d Oceanic Tide Experiments

Oceanic tide experiments are crucial for validating and improving oceanic tide models. These experiments involve the collection of data in the ocean, which can then be compared with the predictions of the models. This comparison allows us to assess the accuracy of the models and to identify areas where they may need to be refined.

#### 5.1d.1 In Situ Observations

In situ observations involve the direct measurement of oceanic tides. This can be done using a variety of instruments, including tide gauges, acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs), and satellite altimeters.

Tide gauges are the most common type of in situ instrument for measuring oceanic tides. They are typically located in harbors or along the coast, and they measure the change in sea level over time. The data collected by tide gauges can be used to validate tidal models and to study the long-term changes in tidal patterns.

ADCPs are another type of in situ instrument that can be used to measure oceanic tides. They work by emitting a series of acoustic pulses into the water column, and then measuring the time it takes for these pulses to return. By analyzing the Doppler shift of the returning pulses, ADCPs can determine the speed and direction of the water flow, which can be used to infer the presence and strength of tidal currents.

Satellite altimeters are a more recent type of in situ instrument for measuring oceanic tides. They work by bouncing radar waves off the surface of the ocean and measuring the time it takes for these waves to return. By analyzing the delay in the return time, altimeters can determine the change in sea level, which can be used to infer the presence and strength of tidal currents.

#### 5.1d.2 Laboratory Experiments

Laboratory experiments involve the creation of a controlled environment in which the dynamics of oceanic tides can be studied. These experiments can be used to investigate the effects of various factors on tidal patterns, such as the Earth's rotation, the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun, and the topography of the ocean floor.

One type of laboratory experiment involves the use of rotating tanks, which can be used to simulate the effects of the Earth's rotation on tidal patterns. These tanks are filled with a fluid that represents the ocean, and they are rotated at a rate that corresponds to the Earth's rotation. By studying the tidal patterns that emerge in these tanks, researchers can gain a better understanding of the role of the Earth's rotation in the generation of tides.

Another type of laboratory experiment involves the use of numerical models, which can be used to simulate the dynamics of oceanic tides. These models can be used to investigate the effects of various factors on tidal patterns, such as the Earth's rotation, the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun, and the topography of the ocean floor. By comparing the results of these simulations with the data collected from in situ observations, researchers can validate and improve these models.




### Subsection: 5.2a Atmospheric Tide Generation

Atmospheric tides are generated by the periodic heating of the atmosphere by the Sun. This heating causes variations in the atmospheric pressure, which in turn generates atmospheric tides. The largest-amplitude atmospheric tides are mostly generated in the troposphere and stratosphere, where the atmosphere is periodically heated by water vapor and ozone absorption of solar radiation during the day.

The generated atmospheric tides can then propagate away from these source regions and ascend into the mesosphere and thermosphere. Atmospheric tides can be measured as regular fluctuations in wind, temperature, density, and pressure. However, it is important to note that atmospheric tides share much in common with ocean tides, but they have two key distinguishing features.

Firstly, atmospheric tides are primarily excited by the Sun's heating of the atmosphere, whereas ocean tides are primarily excited by the Moon's gravitational field. This means that most atmospheric tides have periods of oscillation related to the 24-hour length of the solar day, whereas ocean tides have longer periods of oscillation related to the lunar day (time between successive lunar transits) of about 24 hours 51 minutes.

Secondly, atmospheric tides propagate in an atmosphere where density varies significantly with height. A consequence of this is that their amplitudes naturally increase exponentially as the tide ascends into progressively more rarefied regions of the atmosphere. In contrast, the density of the oceans varies only slightly with depth, and so there the tides do not necessarily vary in amplitude with depth.

The gravitational fields of the Sun and Moon also raise tides in the atmosphere, with the lunar gravitational atmospheric tidal effect being significantly greater than its solar counterpart. At ground level, atmospheric tides can be detected as regular but small oscillations in surface pressure with periods of 24 and 12 hours. Daily pressure maxima occur at 10 a.m. and 10 p.m. local time, while minima occur at 4 a.m. and 4 p.m. local time.

In the next section, we will discuss the propagation of atmospheric tides and their effects on the atmosphere.




### Subsection: 5.2b Atmospheric Tide Characteristics

Atmospheric tides exhibit several key characteristics that distinguish them from ocean tides. These characteristics are primarily due to the unique properties of the atmosphere, such as its density structure and the presence of solar and lunar gravitational fields.

#### 5.2b.1 Atmospheric Tide Propagation

Atmospheric tides propagate in an atmosphere where density varies significantly with height. This means that the amplitude of an atmospheric tide can increase exponentially as the tide ascends into progressively more rarefied regions of the atmosphere. This is in contrast to ocean tides, which propagate in a medium (the ocean) where density varies only slightly with depth.

The propagation of atmospheric tides can be described by the classical tidal theory, which assumes that atmospheric wave motions can be considered as linear perturbations of an initially motionless zonal mean state that is horizontally stratified and isothermal. The classical theory leads to the linearized equations for perturbations (primed variables) in a spherical isothermal atmosphere:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} = -\frac{1}{\rho} \nabla p' + \mathbf{g} + \mathbf{F}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) = 0
$$

$$
\frac{\partial p'}{\partial t} + \rho \mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla p' = 0
$$

where $\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity vector, $p'$ is the pressure perturbation, $\rho$ is the density perturbation, $\mathbf{g}$ is the gravitational acceleration, and $\mathbf{F}$ is the external force vector.

#### 5.2b.2 Atmospheric Tide Frequency

The frequency of atmospheric tides is primarily determined by the 24-hour length of the solar day. This is because most atmospheric tides are generated by the Sun's heating of the atmosphere. The frequency of atmospheric tides can be calculated using the formula:

$$
f = \frac{1}{T}
$$

where $f$ is the frequency and $T$ is the period of the tide. For atmospheric tides, the period $T$ is typically 24 hours.

#### 5.2b.3 Atmospheric Tide Amplitude

The amplitude of atmospheric tides can vary significantly with height in the atmosphere. This is due to the exponential increase in amplitude as the tide ascends into progressively more rarefied regions of the atmosphere. The amplitude of atmospheric tides can also be influenced by the gravitational fields of the Sun and Moon. The lunar gravitational atmospheric tidal effect is typically greater than its solar counterpart.

#### 5.2b.4 Atmospheric Tide Dissipation

Atmospheric tides can dissipate due to friction with the Earth's surface and the presence of topographic obstacles. This dissipation can lead to the damping of atmospheric tides, particularly in the lower layers of the atmosphere. The dissipation of atmospheric tides can be described by the classical tidal theory, which includes terms for mechanical forcing and dissipation.

In conclusion, atmospheric tides exhibit unique characteristics that are primarily due to the properties of the atmosphere. These characteristics include the exponential increase in amplitude with height, the primary frequency determined by the solar day, the variation in amplitude with height, and the dissipation of tides due to friction and topographic obstacles. Understanding these characteristics is crucial for understanding the dynamics of atmospheric tides.




### Subsection: 5.2c Atmospheric Tide Models

Atmospheric tides are complex phenomena that are influenced by a variety of factors, including the Earth's rotation, the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon, and the density structure of the atmosphere. To understand and predict these tides, scientists have developed a variety of mathematical models. These models are based on the principles of fluid dynamics and are used to simulate the propagation of atmospheric tides.

#### 5.2c.1 Primitive Equations

The primitive equations are a set of non-linear differential equations that describe the motion of fluid in the atmosphere. These equations are based on the principles of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy, and they are used to model a wide range of atmospheric phenomena, including atmospheric tides.

The primitive equations can be written as:

$$
\frac{Du}{Dt} - fv = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} + F_x
$$

$$
\frac{Dv}{Dt} + fu = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial y} + F_y
$$

$$
\frac{Dw}{Dt} = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial z} - g + F_z
$$

$$
\frac{D\rho}{Dt} = -\rho (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{V})
$$

$$
\frac{D\theta}{Dt} = Q
$$

where $D/Dt$ is the material derivative, $f$ is the Coriolis parameter, $u$, $v$, and $w$ are the components of the velocity vector $\mathbf{V}$ in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ directions, respectively, $p$ is the pressure, $\rho$ is the density, $\theta$ is the potential temperature, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $F_x$, $F_y$, and $F_z$ are the components of the external force vector, and $Q$ is the heat source term.

#### 5.2c.2 Atmospheric Tide Models

Atmospheric tide models are based on the primitive equations and are used to simulate the propagation of atmospheric tides. These models take into account the effects of the Earth's rotation, the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon, and the density structure of the atmosphere.

One of the most widely used atmospheric tide models is the MM5 (Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications) model. This model is a three-dimensional, primitive equations model that is used to simulate a wide range of atmospheric phenomena, including atmospheric tides.

The MM5 model is based on the primitive equations, but it also includes a number of additional equations and parameters that are used to represent various physical processes, such as convection, radiation, and cloud formation. These additional equations and parameters are necessary to accurately simulate the complex dynamics of the atmosphere.

The MM5 model is used to simulate atmospheric tides by solving the primitive equations for the atmosphere. The model takes into account the effects of the Earth's rotation, the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon, and the density structure of the atmosphere. The model also includes a parameterization of the Coriolis force, which is necessary to accurately simulate the propagation of atmospheric tides.

In addition to the MM5 model, there are a number of other atmospheric tide models that are used to simulate atmospheric tides. These models include the GFDL (Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory) model, the NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) model, and the UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles) model.

Each of these models has its own strengths and weaknesses, and they are used to study different aspects of atmospheric tides. For example, the GFDL model is used to study the effects of atmospheric tides on the global circulation, while the NCAR model is used to study the effects of atmospheric tides on the North American climate.

In conclusion, atmospheric tide models are essential tools for understanding and predicting atmospheric tides. These models are based on the primitive equations and take into account the effects of the Earth's rotation, the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon, and the density structure of the atmosphere. They are used to simulate a wide range of atmospheric phenomena, including atmospheric tides, and they play a crucial role in our understanding of the atmosphere.





### Subsection: 5.2d Atmospheric Tide Experiments

Atmospheric tide experiments are crucial for understanding the dynamics of atmospheric tides and their impact on the Earth's atmosphere. These experiments are typically conducted in laboratory settings, using mathematical models and computer simulations, and can provide valuable insights into the behavior of atmospheric tides.

#### 5.2d.1 Laboratory Experiments

Laboratory experiments are conducted in controlled environments, where the conditions can be precisely controlled and measured. These experiments often involve the use of rotating tanks, which are used to simulate the Earth's rotation. The tanks are filled with a fluid, typically water or a saltwater solution, which represents the atmosphere. The rotation of the tank creates a Coriolis force, which is similar to the Coriolis force experienced in the Earth's atmosphere.

In these experiments, the effects of various factors, such as the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon, the Earth's rotation, and the density structure of the atmosphere, can be studied. For example, the effects of the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon can be studied by varying the distance between the "sun" and the "earth" in the tank. The effects of the Earth's rotation can be studied by varying the rotation rate of the tank. The effects of the density structure of the atmosphere can be studied by varying the salinity of the fluid in the tank.

#### 5.2d.2 Computer Simulations

Computer simulations are another important tool for studying atmospheric tides. These simulations are based on mathematical models of the atmosphere, such as the primitive equations, and can be used to simulate the propagation of atmospheric tides.

In these simulations, the effects of various factors can be studied by varying the parameters in the model. For example, the effects of the gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon can be studied by varying the parameters that represent the gravitational pull of these celestial bodies. The effects of the Earth's rotation can be studied by varying the rotation rate of the model. The effects of the density structure of the atmosphere can be studied by varying the parameters that represent the density of the atmosphere.

#### 5.2d.3 Comparison with Observational Data

The results of laboratory experiments and computer simulations can be compared with observational data to validate the models and theories. This involves comparing the predictions of the models with real-world observations of atmospheric tides.

For example, the amplitude and cycle time of atmospheric tides can be compared with observational data. The theoretical amplitude of atmospheric tides, as predicted by the Laplace tidal equations, can be compared with the observed amplitude. Similarly, the theoretical cycle time of atmospheric tides, as predicted by the Laplace tidal equations, can be compared with the observed cycle time.

In conclusion, atmospheric tide experiments, both in the laboratory and through computer simulations, are crucial for understanding the dynamics of atmospheric tides and their impact on the Earth's atmosphere. These experiments provide valuable insights into the behavior of atmospheric tides and can help to validate mathematical models and theories.




### Subsection: 5.3a Tidal Forcing Theories

Tidal forcing is a crucial aspect of oceanic and atmospheric dynamics. It is the mechanism by which the gravitational pull of celestial bodies, primarily the Moon and the Sun, causes the rise and fall of the Earth's oceans. This phenomenon is governed by a complex interplay of various factors, including the Earth's rotation, the gravitational pull of celestial bodies, and the density structure of the ocean.

#### 5.3a.1 Tidal Forcing Mechanisms

Tidal forcing can be understood in terms of the Laplace tidal equations, which describe the response of the ocean to tidal forcing. These equations incorporate several key features, including the boundary conditions, the Coriolis effect, and a dissipation term.

The boundary conditions dictate that there is no flow across the coastline and free slip at the bottom. This is a crucial aspect of tidal forcing, as it determines the extent to which the ocean can respond to tidal forcing.

The Coriolis effect, or inertial force, plays a significant role in tidal forcing. It steers flows moving towards the Equator to the west and flows moving away from the Equator towards the east, allowing for the formation of coastally trapped waves.

Finally, a dissipation term, which is analogous to viscosity, is often included in the Laplace tidal equations. This term accounts for the energy loss due to friction as the ocean moves over the seafloor.

#### 5.3a.2 Tidal Forcing and Oceanic Tides

The theoretical amplitude of oceanic tides caused by the Moon is about , which corresponds to the amplitude that would be reached if the ocean possessed a uniform depth, there were no landmasses, and the Earth were rotating in step with the Moon's orbit. The Sun similarly causes tides, of which the theoretical amplitude is about (46% of that of the Moon) with a cycle time of 12 hours.

At spring tide, the two effects add to each other to a theoretical level of , while at neap tide, the theoretical level is reduced to . Since the orbits of the Earth about the Sun, and the Moon about the Earth, are elliptical, tidal amplitudes change somewhat as a result of the varying Earth–Sun and Earth–Moon distances. This causes a variation in the tidal force and theoretical amplitude of about ±18% for the Moon and ±5% for the Sun.

#### 5.3a.3 Tidal Forcing and Atmospheric Tides

Tidal forcing also plays a significant role in atmospheric dynamics. The gravitational pull of celestial bodies, primarily the Moon and the Sun, causes the rise and fall of the Earth's atmosphere, which in turn affects weather patterns and climate.

The effects of tidal forcing on atmospheric tides can be studied through atmospheric tide experiments, which are conducted in laboratory settings using mathematical models and computer simulations. These experiments provide valuable insights into the dynamics of atmospheric tides and their impact on the Earth's atmosphere.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical models used to describe tidal forcing and the techniques used to study it.




### Subsection: 5.3b Tidal Forcing Models

Tidal forcing models are mathematical representations of the tidal forcing mechanisms. These models are used to simulate the tidal forcing and predict the resulting oceanic and atmospheric phenomena. The models are based on the Laplace tidal equations, which describe the response of the ocean to tidal forcing.

#### 5.3b.1 Types of Tidal Forcing Models

There are several types of tidal forcing models, each with its own strengths and limitations. Some of the most commonly used models include:

- **Numerical models:** These models solve the Laplace tidal equations numerically. They can handle complex geometries and boundary conditions, but they require significant computational resources.

- **Analytical models:** These models solve the Laplace tidal equations analytically. They are simpler and faster than numerical models, but they are limited in their ability to handle complex geometries and boundary conditions.

- **Hybrid models:** These models combine the strengths of numerical and analytical models. They solve the Laplace tidal equations numerically in some regions and analytically in others.

#### 5.3b.2 Tidal Forcing Models and Oceanic Tides

Tidal forcing models are used to simulate the oceanic tides. The models can be used to predict the amplitude and phase of the tides, as well as the resulting oceanic and atmospheric phenomena.

The models can also be used to study the effects of various factors on the tidal forcing. For example, the models can be used to study the effects of changes in the Earth's rotation, the gravitational pull of celestial bodies, and the density structure of the ocean on the tidal forcing.

#### 5.3b.3 Tidal Forcing Models and Atmospheric Phenomena

Tidal forcing models are also used to study the effects of tidal forcing on atmospheric phenomena. The models can be used to predict the effects of tidal forcing on atmospheric circulation, weather patterns, and climate.

For example, the models can be used to study the effects of tidal forcing on the atmospheric circulation in the North Atlantic. The tidal forcing can drive the atmospheric circulation, which in turn can affect the climate in the North Atlantic.

In conclusion, tidal forcing models are powerful tools for studying the dynamics and phenomena of atmospheric and oceanic circulations. They provide a quantitative way to understand the complex interplay of various factors that drive the atmospheric and oceanic circulations.




### Subsection: 5.3c Tidal Forcing Experiments

These experiments allow us to observe and study the effects of tidal forcing in a controlled environment. They can provide valuable insights into the complex interactions between the ocean, atmosphere, and celestial bodies.

#### 5.3c.1 Types of Tidal Forcing Experiments

There are several types of tidal forcing experiments, each with its own strengths and limitations. Some of the most commonly used types include:

- **Laboratory experiments:** These experiments are conducted in a controlled laboratory setting. They allow for precise control of the experimental conditions and can provide detailed insights into the tidal forcing mechanisms. However, they are limited in their ability to simulate the large-scale dynamics of the ocean and atmosphere.

- **Field experiments:** These experiments are conducted in the field, often in the ocean. They allow for the study of tidal forcing in a more natural environment. However, they are more challenging to control and can be influenced by a variety of factors, making it difficult to isolate the effects of tidal forcing.

- **Numerical experiments:** These experiments are conducted using numerical models. They allow for the study of tidal forcing under a wide range of conditions and can provide insights into large-scale dynamics. However, they rely on simplifications and assumptions, which may limit their accuracy.

#### 5.3c.2 Tidal Forcing Experiments and Oceanic Tides

Tidal forcing experiments are used to study the effects of tidal forcing on oceanic tides. These experiments can provide insights into the mechanisms behind the generation and propagation of tides. They can also help to validate tidal forcing models and improve our understanding of the oceanic and atmospheric dynamics.

For example, laboratory experiments can be used to study the effects of different factors on the generation of tides, such as the Earth's rotation and the gravitational pull of celestial bodies. Field experiments can be used to study the effects of tidal forcing on oceanic circulation and mixing. Numerical experiments can be used to study the effects of tidal forcing on large-scale oceanic and atmospheric dynamics.

#### 5.3c.3 Tidal Forcing Experiments and Atmospheric Phenomena

## Chapter: Chapter 6: Oceanic and Atmospheric Circulations

### Introduction

The ocean and the atmosphere are two interconnected systems that play a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate and weather patterns. The complex interactions between these two systems, known as oceanic and atmospheric circulations, are the focus of this chapter. 

Oceanic circulation refers to the movement of water in the ocean, driven by a combination of wind, temperature, and density differences. This circulation is responsible for distributing heat around the globe, influencing climate patterns, and regulating the Earth's temperature. The ocean also plays a significant role in the carbon cycle, absorbing about a quarter of the carbon dioxide emitted by human activities.

Atmospheric circulation, on the other hand, refers to the movement of air in the atmosphere, driven by differences in temperature and pressure. This circulation is responsible for the formation of weather patterns, such as storms, hurricanes, and cyclones. The atmosphere also plays a crucial role in the carbon cycle, absorbing about 30% of the carbon dioxide emitted by human activities.

In this chapter, we will delve into the dynamics and phenomena of these two interconnected systems. We will explore the driving forces behind oceanic and atmospheric circulations, their interactions, and their impact on the Earth's climate and weather patterns. We will also discuss the current state of these systems and the potential implications of climate change on their future behavior.

Understanding oceanic and atmospheric circulations is not only crucial for climate scientists but also for anyone interested in the Earth's climate and weather patterns. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of these systems, making complex concepts accessible and understandable to a wide audience. 

Join us as we embark on this journey to unravel the mysteries of oceanic and atmospheric circulations, and their role in shaping our planet's climate and weather patterns.




### Subsection: 5.3d Tidal Forcing Applications

Tidal forcing has a wide range of applications in both the ocean and atmosphere. Understanding the mechanisms behind tidal forcing is crucial for predicting and understanding various phenomena in these two interconnected systems. In this section, we will explore some of the key applications of tidal forcing.

#### 5.3d.1 Tidal Forcing and Oceanic Tides

Tidal forcing plays a crucial role in the generation and propagation of oceanic tides. As discussed in the previous sections, the gravitational pull of celestial bodies, primarily the moon and the sun, causes the ocean's water to bulge out towards and away from these bodies. This bulging creates a tidal force that can be modeled using Laplace's tidal equations.

The oceanic response to tidal forcing is a complex interplay of various factors, including loading effects, self-gravitation, and dynamical response. The long-period tides, with their periods of approximately 24 hours and 50 minutes, are particularly interesting. These tides were long assumed to be nearly in equilibrium with the forcing, meaning that the tide heights should be proportional to the disturbing potential and the induced currents should be very weak. However, recent studies have shown that this is not always the case, particularly in the tropical Pacific and Atlantic.

The nonequilibrium nature of these long-period tides has important implications for the ocean's dynamics. For example, it has been found that the lunar fortnightly tide in the tropical Atlantic is particularly strong, with a large amplitude and a strong dynamical response. This is in contrast to the lunar monthly tide, which is closer to equilibrium. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the ocean's dynamics and its response to tidal forcing.

#### 5.3d.2 Tidal Forcing and Atmospheric Phenomena

Tidal forcing also plays a crucial role in various atmospheric phenomena. For example, the tidal force can induce atmospheric tides, which are atmospheric disturbances with periods of approximately 24 hours and 50 minutes. These atmospheric tides can influence the atmospheric circulation and weather patterns, particularly in the lower layers of the atmosphere.

Furthermore, tidal forcing can also influence the atmospheric pressure and wind patterns. The tidal force can cause a rise and fall in atmospheric pressure, which can affect the wind patterns. This is particularly important in the upper layers of the atmosphere, where the wind patterns can be influenced by the tidal force.

In conclusion, tidal forcing plays a crucial role in both the ocean and atmosphere. Understanding the mechanisms behind tidal forcing is crucial for predicting and understanding various phenomena in these two interconnected systems.




### Subsection: 5.4a Tidal Analysis Methods

Tidal analysis is a crucial aspect of understanding the dynamics of tides. It involves the use of mathematical models and computational methods to analyze the complex interactions between the gravitational pull of celestial bodies and the Earth's oceans. In this section, we will explore some of the key methods used in tidal analysis.

#### 5.4a.1 Tidal Analysis Using Laplace's Tidal Equations

Laplace's tidal equations are a set of differential equations that describe the motion of the Earth's oceans in response to tidal forcing. These equations are derived from the principles of conservation of mass and momentum, and they take into account the effects of loading, self-gravitation, and dynamical response.

The long-period tides, with their periods of approximately 24 hours and 50 minutes, are particularly interesting in the context of tidal analysis. These tides were long assumed to be nearly in equilibrium with the forcing, meaning that the tide heights should be proportional to the disturbing potential and the induced currents should be very weak. However, recent studies have shown that this is not always the case, particularly in the tropical Pacific and Atlantic.

The nonequilibrium nature of these long-period tides has important implications for the ocean's dynamics.

## Chapter 6: Atmospheric and Oceanic Circulations: Dynamics and Phenomena




### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of large-scale motions on a rotating Earth. The Earth's rotation plays a crucial role in shaping the dynamics of atmospheric and oceanic circulations. The Coriolis effect, a direct consequence of the Earth's rotation, is a key factor in the formation of these large-scale motions. 

The Coriolis effect is a phenomenon that causes objects moving over the surface of the Earth to be deflected to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. This effect is responsible for the formation of large-scale motions such as cyclones and anticyclones in the atmosphere, and gyres in the ocean. 

We will explore the mathematical models that describe these large-scale motions, including the Navier-Stokes equations and the primitive equations. These equations, expressed in terms of the Coriolis parameter $f$, provide a mathematical framework for understanding the dynamics of large-scale motions. 

Furthermore, we will discuss the role of these large-scale motions in the transport of heat, moisture, and nutrients across the Earth's surface. This transport plays a crucial role in shaping the Earth's climate and weather patterns. 

By the end of this chapter, you will have a deeper understanding of the dynamics of large-scale motions on a rotating Earth, and their role in atmospheric and oceanic circulations. This knowledge will provide a solid foundation for the subsequent chapters, where we will delve deeper into the specifics of atmospheric and oceanic circulations.




### Subsection: 6.1a Coriolis Force Theories

The Coriolis force is a fundamental concept in the study of atmospheric and oceanic circulations. It is a result of the Earth's rotation and plays a crucial role in the formation of large-scale motions. In this section, we will explore the theories that explain the Coriolis force and its implications for atmospheric and oceanic circulations.

#### 6.1a.1 Newtonian Theory

The Newtonian theory of the Coriolis force is based on Newton's second law of motion. According to this theory, the Coriolis force is a result of the conservation of angular momentum. When a body moves over the surface of the Earth, it experiences a deflection due to the Earth's rotation. This deflection is proportional to the angular velocity of the Earth and the linear velocity of the body. Mathematically, the Coriolis force $F_c$ can be expressed as:

$$
F_c = 2m\Omega \times v
$$

where $m$ is the mass of the body, $\Omega$ is the angular velocity of the Earth, and $v$ is the linear velocity of the body.

#### 6.1a.2 Eulerian Theory

The Eulerian theory of the Coriolis force is based on Euler's rotation equations. According to this theory, the Coriolis force is a result of the conservation of potential vorticity. Potential vorticity is a measure of the rotation of a fluid element. When a fluid element moves over the surface of the Earth, it experiences a change in potential vorticity due to the Earth's rotation. This change in potential vorticity results in a Coriolis force. Mathematically, the Coriolis force $F_c$ can be expressed as:

$$
F_c = \frac{1}{\rho}\nabla \times (\rho \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{\Omega})
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid element, $\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity of the fluid element, and $\mathbf{\Omega}$ is the angular velocity of the Earth.

#### 6.1a.3 Geostrophic Balance

The geostrophic balance is a fundamental concept in the study of atmospheric and oceanic circulations. It is a balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. When these two forces are in balance, the flow is said to be geostrophic. Mathematically, the geostrophic balance can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla \times (\rho \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{\Omega}) = -\nabla p
$$

where $\nabla p$ is the pressure gradient force.

The geostrophic balance is a key concept in the study of large-scale motions on a rotating Earth. It helps us understand the formation of atmospheric and oceanic circulations, and the role of the Coriolis force in these circulations. In the next section, we will explore the implications of the geostrophic balance for atmospheric and oceanic circulations.

### Section: 6.1 Coriolis Force and Geostrophic Balance:

#### 6.1a Introduction to Coriolis Force and Geostrophic Balance

The Coriolis force and geostrophic balance are fundamental concepts in the study of atmospheric and oceanic circulations. They are key to understanding the large-scale motions that occur on a rotating Earth.

The Coriolis force is a result of the Earth's rotation. It is responsible for the deflection of objects moving over the Earth's surface. The Coriolis force is given by the equation:

$$
\mathbf{C} = -2\mathbf{\Omega} \times \mathbf{V}
$$

where $\mathbf{\Omega}$ is the Earth's rotation vector and $\mathbf{V}$ is the velocity of the object. The Coriolis force is always perpendicular to the direction of motion and to the right of the direction of motion in the Northern Hemisphere, and to the left of the direction of motion in the Southern Hemisphere.

Geostrophic balance, on the other hand, is a state in which the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force are in equilibrium. This balance is crucial in maintaining the stability of large-scale motions. The geostrophic balance is given by the equation:

$$
\mathbf{C} = -\nabla p
$$

where $\nabla p$ is the pressure gradient force. This equation shows that the Coriolis force acts in the opposite direction of the pressure gradient force, ensuring that the two forces balance each other out.

The quasi-geostrophic approximation is a simplification used to study large-scale motions. This approximation is based on the assumption that the horizontal scale of the motion is much larger than the vertical scale. The quasi-geostrophic approximation is given by the equations:

$$
\mathbf{V} = \mathbf{V}_g + \mathbf{V}_a
$$

where $\mathbf{V}_g$ is the geostrophic wind and $\mathbf{V}_a$ is the ageostrophic wind. The geostrophic wind is the wind that would result from the balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force, while the ageostrophic wind is the deviation from this balance.

Finally, topographic Rossby waves are a result of the interaction between the Earth's topography and the atmospheric or oceanic flow. These waves are a crucial component of large-scale motions, playing a significant role in shaping the dynamics of atmospheric and oceanic circulations.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these concepts, exploring their implications for atmospheric and oceanic circulations. We will also discuss how these concepts are used in the study of large-scale motions, providing examples and case studies to illustrate their application.

#### 6.1b Coriolis Force and Geostrophic Balance Experiments

To further understand the concepts of Coriolis force and geostrophic balance, let's consider some experiments. These experiments will help us visualize these concepts and understand their implications for atmospheric and oceanic circulations.

##### Experiment 1: Coriolis Force

In this experiment, we will simulate the Coriolis force on a rotating sphere. We will use a simple model where we rotate a sphere and release a small object from a fixed point on the sphere. The object will move along a circular path due to the Coriolis force.

We can represent this experiment mathematically as follows:

Let $r$ be the radius of the sphere, $\omega$ be the angular velocity of the sphere, and $v$ be the velocity of the object. The Coriolis force $F_c$ acting on the object is given by:

$$
F_c = -2\omega r v
$$

This force acts perpendicular to the direction of motion, causing the object to move along a circular path.

##### Experiment 2: Geostrophic Balance

In this experiment, we will simulate the geostrophic balance on a rotating sphere. We will use a simple model where we apply a pressure gradient on the surface of the sphere. The Coriolis force will balance this pressure gradient, maintaining the geostrophic balance.

We can represent this experiment mathematically as follows:

Let $p$ be the pressure, $g$ be the acceleration due to gravity, and $r$ be the radius of the sphere. The pressure gradient force $F_p$ is given by:

$$
F_p = -\nabla p = -g \frac{\partial p}{\partial r}
$$

The Coriolis force $F_c$ is given by:

$$
F_c = -2\omega r v
$$

When these two forces are equal, the geostrophic balance is maintained.

These experiments help us understand the Coriolis force and geostrophic balance in a concrete way. They show how these forces shape the large-scale motions on a rotating Earth, playing a crucial role in atmospheric and oceanic circulations.

#### 6.1c Coriolis Force and Geostrophic Balance Applications

In this section, we will explore some applications of the Coriolis force and geostrophic balance in atmospheric and oceanic circulations. These applications will help us understand the practical implications of these concepts and how they shape the dynamics of large-scale motions.

##### Application 1: Oceanic Circulations

The Coriolis force plays a crucial role in oceanic circulations. In the Northern Hemisphere, the Coriolis force deflects ocean currents to the right of their original direction, while in the Southern Hemisphere, it deflects them to the left. This deflection is responsible for the formation of large-scale oceanic currents, such as the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio Current.

The geostrophic balance is also important in oceanic circulations. It helps maintain the stability of large-scale oceanic currents, preventing them from deviating significantly from their mean paths. This balance is particularly important in the formation of eddies, which are small-scale circular currents that play a key role in the mixing of the ocean.

##### Application 2: Atmospheric Circulations

In the atmosphere, the Coriolis force is responsible for the formation of large-scale wind patterns, such as the Hadley, Ferrel, and Polar cells. These cells are formed due to the Coriolis force deflecting the trade winds to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere.

The geostrophic balance is also important in atmospheric circulations. It helps maintain the stability of large-scale wind patterns, preventing them from deviating significantly from their mean paths. This balance is particularly important in the formation of cyclones and anticyclones, which are large-scale atmospheric systems that play a key role in weather patterns.

In conclusion, the Coriolis force and geostrophic balance are fundamental concepts in the study of atmospheric and oceanic circulations. They shape the dynamics of large-scale motions, playing a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of various atmospheric and oceanic systems. Understanding these concepts is essential for understanding the complex dynamics of our planet's atmosphere and oceans.

#### 6.1d Coriolis Force and Geostrophic Balance Observations

In this section, we will delve into the observations of the Coriolis force and geostrophic balance in the atmosphere and oceans. These observations will provide a real-world perspective on the concepts discussed in the previous sections.

##### Observation 1: Coriolis Force in Oceanic Circulations

The Coriolis force can be directly observed in the ocean through satellite imagery. The Sentinel-3 satellite, for instance, provides data on sea surface temperature and ocean color, which can be used to identify large-scale oceanic currents. The deflection of these currents due to the Coriolis force can be clearly observed, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere where currents are deflected to the right.

##### Observation 2: Geostrophic Balance in Oceanic Circulations

The geostrophic balance can also be observed in the ocean. Eddies, which are small-scale circular currents, are a manifestation of the geostrophic balance. These eddies can be observed through satellite imagery, particularly in the Southern Ocean where they play a crucial role in the mixing of the ocean.

##### Observation 3: Coriolis Force in Atmospheric Circulations

The Coriolis force can be observed in the atmosphere through weather patterns. The Hadley, Ferrel, and Polar cells, which are large-scale wind patterns formed due to the Coriolis force, can be observed through weather maps. The deflection of these wind patterns to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere is a clear manifestation of the Coriolis force.

##### Observation 4: Geostrophic Balance in Atmospheric Circulations

The geostrophic balance can also be observed in the atmosphere. Cyclones and anticyclones, which are large-scale atmospheric systems, are a manifestation of the geostrophic balance. These systems can be observed through weather patterns and satellite imagery.

In conclusion, the observations of the Coriolis force and geostrophic balance provide a real-world perspective on these concepts. They show how these concepts shape the dynamics of large-scale motions in the atmosphere and oceans, and how they are responsible for the formation of various atmospheric and oceanic systems.




### Section: 6.2 Geostrophic Currents:

#### 6.2a Geostrophic Current Theories

Geostrophic currents are a fundamental aspect of large-scale motions on a rotating Earth. They are a result of the balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force, as described by the geostrophic balance equation:

$$
\mathbf{C} = -\nabla p
$$

The geostrophic current theory is based on the quasi-geostrophic approximation, which assumes that the horizontal scale of the motion is much larger than the vertical scale. This allows us to simplify the equations of motion and derive the geostrophic current equations.

The geostrophic current equations can be derived from the quasi-geostrophic momentum equation, which can be obtained from the horizontal momentum equation:

$$
\frac{D\mathbf{V}}{Dt} = -\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p + \mathbf{g} + \mathbf{F}
$$

where $\frac{D}{Dt}$ is the material derivative, $\rho$ is the density, $\mathbf{g}$ is the gravitational acceleration, and $\mathbf{F}$ is the frictional force.

The material derivative in the quasi-geostrophic momentum equation is defined by:

$$
\frac{D}{Dt} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \mathbf{V}\cdot\nabla
$$

The horizontal velocity $\mathbf{V}$ can be separated into a geostrophic part $\mathbf{V}_g$ and an ageostrophic part $\mathbf{V}_a$:

$$
\mathbf{V} = \mathbf{V}_g + \mathbf{V}_a
$$

Substituting this into the quasi-geostrophic momentum equation and neglecting the ageostrophic terms, we obtain the geostrophic current equations:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{V}_g}{\partial t} = -\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p_g + \mathbf{g}_g + \mathbf{F}_g
$$

where $p_g$ and $\mathbf{g}_g$ are the geostrophic parts of the pressure and gravitational acceleration, respectively, and $\mathbf{F}_g$ is the geostrophic part of the frictional force.

These equations describe the evolution of the geostrophic currents. They show that the geostrophic currents are driven by the pressure gradient and the gravitational acceleration, and are damped by the frictional force. The geostrophic currents play a crucial role in the large-scale motions on a rotating Earth, and their study is essential for understanding atmospheric and oceanic circulations.

#### 6.2b Geostrophic Current Phenomena

The geostrophic currents, as described by the geostrophic current equations, exhibit several interesting phenomena. These phenomena are a direct result of the balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force, and they play a crucial role in the large-scale motions on a rotating Earth.

##### Geostrophic Balance

The geostrophic balance is a state in which the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force are in equilibrium. This balance is crucial for the existence of geostrophic currents. In the geostrophic balance, the Coriolis force acts in the opposite direction of the pressure gradient force, ensuring that the two forces balance each other out. This balance is described by the geostrophic balance equation:

$$
\mathbf{C} = -\nabla p
$$

##### Geostrophic Wind

The geostrophic wind is the component of the wind that is parallel to the isobars or isopycnals. It is a result of the geostrophic balance and is responsible for the large-scale motions on a rotating Earth. The geostrophic wind is given by the equation:

$$
\mathbf{V}_g = \frac{1}{f_0}\nabla p_g
$$

where $f_0$ is the Coriolis parameter, and $p_g$ is the geostrophic part of the pressure.

##### Geostrophic Currents

The geostrophic currents are the result of the geostrophic balance and the geostrophic wind. They are responsible for the large-scale motions on a rotating Earth, and they play a crucial role in the atmospheric and oceanic circulations. The geostrophic currents are described by the geostrophic current equations:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{V}_g}{\partial t} = -\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p_g + \mathbf{g}_g + \mathbf{F}_g
$$

where $\mathbf{V}_g$ is the geostrophic part of the velocity, $p_g$ is the geostrophic part of the pressure, $\mathbf{g}_g$ is the geostrophic part of the gravitational acceleration, and $\mathbf{F}_g$ is the geostrophic part of the frictional force.

##### Quasi-Geostrophic Approximation

The quasi-geostrophic approximation is a simplification used to study large-scale motions on a rotating Earth. It assumes that the horizontal scale of the motion is much larger than the vertical scale. This allows us to neglect the ageostrophic terms in the quasi-geostrophic momentum equation, and derive the geostrophic current equations. The quasi-geostrophic approximation is crucial for understanding the geostrophic currents and their phenomena.

#### 6.2c Geostrophic Current Applications

The geostrophic currents, as described by the geostrophic current equations, have a wide range of applications in the study of atmospheric and oceanic circulations. These applications are a direct result of the phenomena exhibited by the geostrophic currents, such as the geostrophic balance, geostrophic wind, and the quasi-geostrophic approximation.

##### Geostrophic Balance in Atmospheric Circulations

The geostrophic balance plays a crucial role in the atmospheric circulations. It is responsible for the formation of large-scale atmospheric motions, such as the Hadley, Ferrel, and Polar cells. These cells are responsible for the global atmospheric circulation, which plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate.

The geostrophic balance is also responsible for the formation of atmospheric fronts, which are regions of sharp temperature gradients. These fronts are often associated with areas of intense atmospheric activity, such as thunderstorms and cyclones.

##### Geostrophic Wind in Oceanic Circulations

The geostrophic wind is a key component of the oceanic circulations. It is responsible for the formation of large-scale oceanic motions, such as the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio Current. These currents play a crucial role in the global oceanic circulation, which is responsible for the transport of heat and nutrients around the world.

The geostrophic wind is also responsible for the formation of oceanic fronts, which are regions of sharp salinity gradients. These fronts are often associated with areas of intense oceanic activity, such as upwelling and downwelling.

##### Quasi-Geostrophic Approximation in Large-Scale Motions

The quasi-geostrophic approximation is a powerful tool for studying large-scale motions on a rotating Earth. It allows us to simplify the equations of motion and derive the geostrophic current equations. This approximation is particularly useful in the study of atmospheric and oceanic circulations, where the horizontal scale of the motion is often much larger than the vertical scale.

The quasi-geostrophic approximation is also used in the study of topographic Rossby waves, which are large-scale motions that are influenced by the Earth's topography. These waves play a crucial role in the atmospheric and oceanic circulations, and their study is essential for understanding the dynamics of these circulations.




#### 6.2b Geostrophic Current Models

The geostrophic current models are based on the geostrophic current equations derived from the quasi-geostrophic approximation. These models are used to study the large-scale motions on a rotating Earth, such as ocean currents and atmospheric winds.

The geostrophic current models can be classified into two types: the shallow water model and the deep water model. The shallow water model is used for flows in which the vertical scale of motion is much smaller than the horizontal scale, while the deep water model is used for flows in which the vertical scale of motion is comparable to the horizontal scale.

The shallow water model is based on the following assumptions:

1. The vertical scale of motion is much smaller than the horizontal scale.
2. The fluid is incompressible.
3. The Coriolis force is balanced by the pressure gradient force.

The shallow water model can be described by the following equations:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = -u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} - v \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + f v + \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial p}{\partial x}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = -u \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} - v \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} - f u + \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial p}{\partial y}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} = -u \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} - v \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial y}
$$

where $u$ and $v$ are the horizontal velocities in the x and y directions, respectively, $p$ is the pressure, $\eta$ is the surface elevation, $f$ is the Coriolis parameter, and $\rho$ is the density.

The deep water model, on the other hand, is based on the following assumptions:

1. The vertical scale of motion is comparable to the horizontal scale.
2. The fluid is incompressible.
3. The Coriolis force is balanced by the pressure gradient force.

The deep water model can be described by the following equations:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = -u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} - v \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + f v + \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial p}{\partial x}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} = -u \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} - v \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} - f u + \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial p}{\partial y}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} = -u \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} - v \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial y}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = -u \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial x} - v \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial y}
$$

where $\rho$ is the density.

These models are used to study the large-scale motions on a rotating Earth, such as ocean currents and atmospheric winds. They provide a simplified representation of the complex physical processes involved in these motions, and are therefore useful for understanding the dynamics and phenomena of these motions.

#### 6.2c Geostrophic Current Observations

Observations of geostrophic currents are crucial for understanding the dynamics and phenomena of large-scale motions on a rotating Earth. These observations can be made through various methods, including satellite measurements, in-situ measurements, and numerical models.

Satellite measurements, such as those from the RAPID program, provide a global view of the ocean circulation. The RAPID program, for instance, monitors the ocean circulation since 2004 using a network of moorings in the North Atlantic. These measurements can be used to study the geostrophic currents, as they provide information about the velocity and direction of the ocean currents.

In-situ measurements, on the other hand, involve direct measurements of the ocean currents. These measurements can be made using various instruments, such as current meters, acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs), and drifters. These measurements can provide detailed information about the geostrophic currents, including their strength, direction, and variability.

Numerical models, such as the primitive equations model, can also be used to study the geostrophic currents. These models solve the primitive equations, which describe the motion of fluid on a rotating sphere. The primitive equations model can be used to simulate the geostrophic currents, providing insights into their dynamics and phenomena.

The quasi-geostrophic approximation is often used in these models. This approximation assumes that the horizontal scale of the motion is much larger than the vertical scale, and that the flow is nearly geostrophic. This allows us to simplify the equations of motion, making them easier to solve.

The quasi-geostrophic approximation can be expressed as follows:

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + H_0 \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \right) + \alpha_0 \frac{g}{f_0} \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} = 0
$$

where $\eta$ is the surface elevation, $u$ and $v$ are the horizontal velocities in the x and y directions, respectively, $H_0$ is the mean depth, $\alpha_0$ is the thermal expansion coefficient, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $f_0$ is the Coriolis parameter.

This equation describes the evolution of the surface elevation, which is a key component of the geostrophic currents. It shows that the surface elevation is influenced by the horizontal velocities, the mean depth, and the thermal expansion coefficient. This equation can be used to study the geostrophic currents, providing insights into their dynamics and phenomena.




#### 6.2c Geostrophic Current Experiments

Geostrophic currents are a fundamental aspect of atmospheric and oceanic dynamics. They are driven by the balance between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force, and they play a crucial role in the transport of heat, salt, and nutrients across the globe. To better understand these currents, scientists have conducted a series of experiments, both in the laboratory and in the field.

##### Laboratory Experiments

Laboratory experiments have been instrumental in studying geostrophic currents. These experiments allow scientists to control and manipulate the conditions, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of geostrophic currents. For instance, researchers at MIT have conducted experiments in a rotating annulus, a setup that mimics the conditions on a rotating planet. These experiments have shed light on the formation and evolution of geostrophic currents, providing insights into the role of rotation and stratification in their dynamics.

##### Field Experiments

Field experiments, on the other hand, allow scientists to study geostrophic currents in their natural environment. These experiments often involve the use of instruments such as current meters and acoustic Doppler current profilers (ADCPs) to measure the velocity and structure of the currents. For example, the RAPID program, which has been monitoring the ocean circulation since 2004, has provided valuable data on the strength and variability of the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC). This data has been crucial in understanding the role of geostrophic currents in the transport of heat and nutrients across the globe.

##### Numerical Models

In addition to laboratory and field experiments, scientists also use numerical models to study geostrophic currents. These models, which are based on the geostrophic current equations, allow scientists to simulate the dynamics of geostrophic currents under different conditions. For instance, the primitive equations, which are a set of non-linear differential equations that describe the motion of fluid on a rotating sphere, are often used to model geostrophic currents. These models have been instrumental in understanding the role of geostrophic currents in the global circulation of the atmosphere and the ocean.

In conclusion, geostrophic current experiments, whether in the laboratory, in the field, or through numerical models, have been crucial in advancing our understanding of geostrophic currents. They have provided valuable insights into the dynamics of these currents, shedding light on their role in the transport of heat, salt, and nutrients across the globe.




#### 6.2d Geostrophic Current Applications

Geostrophic currents have a wide range of applications in both the atmosphere and the ocean. They play a crucial role in the transport of heat, salt, and nutrients across the globe, influencing weather patterns, ocean circulation, and climate. In this section, we will explore some of the key applications of geostrophic currents.

##### Oceanic Applications

In the ocean, geostrophic currents are responsible for the large-scale circulation patterns that transport heat and nutrients around the globe. The Gulf Stream, for instance, is a prime example of a geostrophic current. It is a warm, swift Atlantic Ocean current that originates in the Gulf of Mexico and flows along the eastern coast of the United States. The Gulf Stream is a manifestation of the geostrophic balance, where the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force are in equilibrium. This balance allows the Gulf Stream to flow along the eastern coast of the United States, where it is deflected by the continental shelf and forms the Labrador Current.

Geostrophic currents also play a crucial role in the formation of ocean eddies. Eddies are circular currents that can range in size from a few kilometers to hundreds of kilometers. They are formed when the geostrophic balance is disturbed, leading to the formation of eddies that can transport heat, salt, and nutrients across the ocean.

##### Atmospheric Applications

In the atmosphere, geostrophic currents are responsible for the formation of large-scale weather patterns. The jet stream, for instance, is a fast, narrow, and high-altitude wind current that flows from west to east in the upper troposphere. The jet stream is a manifestation of the geostrophic balance, where the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force are in equilibrium. This balance allows the jet stream to flow along the polar front, where it is deflected by the continental shelf and forms the polar front.

Geostrophic currents also play a crucial role in the formation of atmospheric eddies. Eddies are circular currents that can range in size from a few kilometers to hundreds of kilometers. They are formed when the geostrophic balance is disturbed, leading to the formation of eddies that can transport heat, moisture, and energy across the atmosphere.

In conclusion, geostrophic currents have a wide range of applications in both the atmosphere and the ocean. They play a crucial role in the transport of heat, salt, and nutrients across the globe, influencing weather patterns, ocean circulation, and climate. Understanding the dynamics of geostrophic currents is therefore essential for understanding the dynamics of the atmosphere and the ocean.




#### 6.3a Geostrophic Adjustment Theories

Geostrophic adjustment is a fundamental concept in the study of atmospheric and oceanic circulations. It refers to the process by which a system adjusts to a new state of equilibrium after a disturbance. In this section, we will explore the theories behind geostrophic adjustment and how they apply to large-scale motions on a rotating earth.

##### The Quasi-Geostrophic Approximation

The quasi-geostrophic approximation is a mathematical tool used to simplify the equations governing large-scale motions on a rotating earth. It assumes that the Rossby number, Ro, and the Rossby number based on topography, Ro<sub>T</sub>, are both much less than 1. This allows us to make the following approximations:

$$
u = \bar{u}+\tilde{u} \qquad \text{with} \qquad \bar{u}=-{g \over f_0}{\partial \eta \over \partial y}\\[3pt]
v = \bar{v}+\tilde{v} \qquad \text{with} \qquad \bar{v}={g \over f_0}{\partial \eta \over \partial x},\\[3pt]
$$

where $\bar{u}$ and $\bar{v}$ are the geostrophic flow components and $\tilde{u}$ and $\tilde{v}$ are the ageostrophic flow components with $\tilde{u}\ll\bar{u}$ and $\tilde{v}\ll\bar{v}$. Substituting these expressions for $u$ and $v$ in the previously acquired set of equations, yields:

$$
-{g \over f_0}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial y \partial t}+{\partial \tilde{u} \over\partial t}-f_0\tilde{v} = 0\\[3pt]
{g \over f_0}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial x \partial t}+{\partial \tilde{v} \over\partial t}+f_0\tilde{u} = 0\\[3pt]
{\partial \eta\over\partial t}+H_0\left({\partial \tilde{u} \over\partial x} + {\partial \tilde{v} \over\partial y}\right)+\alpha_0 {g \over f_0}{\partial \eta \over \partial x}+ \alpha_0\tilde{v}=0.
$$

Neglecting terms where small component terms ($\tilde{u}$, $\tilde{v}$, ${\partial\over\partial t}$ and $\alpha_0$) are multiplied, the expressions obtained are:

$$
\tilde{v} = -{g \over f_0^2}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial y \partial t}\\[3pt]
\tilde{u} = -{g \over f_0^2}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial x \partial t}\\[3pt]
{\partial \eta\over\partial t}+H_0\left({\partial \tilde{u} \over\partial x} + {\partial \tilde{v} \over\partial y}\right)+\alpha_0 {g \over f_0}{\partial \eta \over \partial x}=0.
$$

Substituting the components of the ageostrophic velocity in the continuity equation, the following result is obtained:

$$
{\partial \eta \over\partial t}-R^2{\partial\over\partial t}\nabla^2 \eta + \alpha_0 {g \over f_0}{\partial \eta \over \partial x}=0.
$$

This equation represents the geostrophic adjustment equation, which describes the process by which a system adjusts to a new state of equilibrium after a disturbance. It is a fundamental equation in the study of atmospheric and oceanic circulations, and it forms the basis for many of the theories and models used to understand large-scale motions on a rotating earth.

#### 6.3b Geostrophic Adjustment Processes

The geostrophic adjustment process is a crucial aspect of large-scale motions on a rotating earth. It is the process by which a system adjusts to a new state of equilibrium after a disturbance. This process is governed by the geostrophic adjustment equation, which we derived in the previous section.

The geostrophic adjustment process can be understood in terms of the quasi-geostrophic approximation. This approximation allows us to simplify the equations governing large-scale motions on a rotating earth. It assumes that the Rossby number, Ro, and the Rossby number based on topography, Ro<sub>T</sub>, are both much less than 1. This allows us to make the following approximations:

$$
u = \bar{u}+\tilde{u} \qquad \text{with} \qquad \bar{u}=-{g \over f_0}{\partial \eta \over \partial y}\\[3pt]
v = \bar{v}+\tilde{v} \qquad \text{with} \qquad \bar{v}={g \over f_0}{\partial \eta \over \partial x},\\[3pt]
$$

where $\bar{u}$ and $\bar{v}$ are the geostrophic flow components and $\tilde{u}$ and $\tilde{v}$ are the ageostrophic flow components with $\tilde{u}\ll\bar{u}$ and $\tilde{v}\ll\bar{v}$. Substituting these expressions for $u$ and $v$ in the previously acquired set of equations, yields:

$$
-{g \over f_0}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial y \partial t}+{\partial \tilde{u} \over\partial t}-f_0\tilde{v} = 0\\[3pt]
{g \over f_0}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial x \partial t}+{\partial \tilde{v} \over\partial t}+f_0\tilde{u} = 0\\[3pt]
{\partial \eta\over\partial t}+H_0\left({\partial \tilde{u} \over\partial x} + {\partial \tilde{v} \over\partial y}\right)+\alpha_0 {g \over f_0}{\partial \eta \over \partial x}+ \alpha_0\tilde{v}=0.
$$

Neglecting terms where small component terms ($\tilde{u}$, $\tilde{v}$, ${\partial\over\partial t}$ and $\alpha_0$) are multiplied, the expressions obtained are:

$$
\tilde{v} = -{g \over f_0^2}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial y \partial t}\\[3pt]
\tilde{u} = -{g \over f_0^2}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial x \partial t}\\[3pt]
{\partial \eta\over\partial t}+H_0\left({\partial \tilde{u} \over\partial x} + {\partial \tilde{v} \over\partial y}\right)+\alpha_0 {g \over f_0}{\partial \eta \over \partial x}=0.
$$

This set of equations describes the geostrophic adjustment process. The first two equations represent the geostrophic balance, which states that the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force are in equilibrium. The third equation represents the continuity equation, which states that the rate of change of eta is equal to the horizontal divergence of the velocity field.

The geostrophic adjustment process is a crucial aspect of large-scale motions on a rotating earth. It is the process by which a system adjusts to a new state of equilibrium after a disturbance. This process is governed by the geostrophic adjustment equation, which we derived in the previous section.

#### 6.3c Geostrophic Adjustment Phenomena

The geostrophic adjustment process is a fundamental aspect of large-scale motions on a rotating earth. It is the process by which a system adjusts to a new state of equilibrium after a disturbance. This process is governed by the geostrophic adjustment equation, which we derived in the previous section.

The geostrophic adjustment equation is a set of three partial differential equations that describe the evolution of the geostrophic flow components $\bar{u}$ and $\bar{v}$, and the ageostrophic flow components $\tilde{u}$ and $\tilde{v}$. These equations are derived from the quasi-geostrophic approximation, which assumes that the Rossby number, Ro, and the Rossby number based on topography, Ro<sub>T</sub>, are both much less than 1.

The first two equations of the geostrophic adjustment equation represent the geostrophic balance. This balance states that the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force are in equilibrium. This balance is crucial for the formation of large-scale motions on a rotating earth, such as the Gulf Stream and the jet stream.

The third equation of the geostrophic adjustment equation represents the continuity equation. This equation states that the rate of change of eta is equal to the horizontal divergence of the velocity field. This equation is crucial for the conservation of mass in the system.

The geostrophic adjustment process is a complex phenomenon that involves the interaction of various physical processes. It is influenced by factors such as the Coriolis force, the pressure gradient force, and the horizontal divergence of the velocity field. Understanding this process is crucial for predicting and understanding large-scale motions on a rotating earth.

In the next section, we will explore some of the key phenomena that are governed by the geostrophic adjustment process. These phenomena include the Gulf Stream, the jet stream, and the formation of eddies. We will also explore how these phenomena are influenced by factors such as topography and the Earth's rotation.

#### 6.3b Geostrophic Adjustment Models

Geostrophic adjustment models are mathematical models used to describe the process of geostrophic adjustment. These models are based on the quasi-geostrophic approximation and are used to study the dynamics of large-scale motions on a rotating earth.

##### The Geostrophic Adjustment Model

The geostrophic adjustment model is a simplified model of the quasi-geostrophic approximation. It assumes that the Rossby number, Ro, and the Rossby number based on topography, Ro<sub>T</sub>, are both much less than 1. This allows us to make the following approximations:

$$
u = \bar{u}+\tilde{u} \qquad \text{with} \qquad \bar{u}=-{g \over f_0}{\partial \eta \over \partial y}\\[3pt]
v = \bar{v}+\tilde{v} \qquad \text{with} \qquad \bar{v}={g \over f_0}{\partial \eta \over \partial x},\\[3pt]
$$

where $\bar{u}$ and $\bar{v}$ are the geostrophic flow components and $\tilde{u}$ and $\tilde{v}$ are the ageostrophic flow components with $\tilde{u}\ll\bar{u}$ and $\tilde{v}\ll\bar{v}$. Substituting these expressions for $u$ and $v$ in the previously acquired set of equations, yields:

$$
-{g \over f_0}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial y \partial t}+{\partial \tilde{u} \over\partial t}-f_0\tilde{v} = 0\\[3pt]
{g \over f_0}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial x \partial t}+{\partial \tilde{v} \over\partial t}+f_0\tilde{u} = 0\\[3pt]
{\partial \eta\over\partial t}+H_0\left({\partial \tilde{u} \over\partial x} + {\partial \tilde{v} \over\partial y}\right)+\alpha_0 {g \over f_0}{\partial \eta \over \partial x}+ \alpha_0\tilde{v}=0.
$$

Neglecting terms where small component terms ($\tilde{u}$, $\tilde{v}$, ${\partial\over\partial t}$ and $\alpha_0$) are multiplied, the expressions obtained are:

$$
\tilde{v} = -{g \over f_0^2}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial y \partial t}\\[3pt]
\tilde{u} = -{g \over f_0^2}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial x \partial t}\\[3pt]

$$

These equations describe the geostrophic adjustment process. The first two equations represent the geostrophic balance, where the Coriolis force is balanced by the pressure gradient force. The third equation represents the ageostrophic balance, where the Coriolis force is balanced by the pressure gradient force and the advection of potential vorticity.

##### The Geostrophic Adjustment Model with Topographic Rossby Waves

The geostrophic adjustment model can be extended to include the effects of topographic Rossby waves. This is done by including the topographic Rossby wave terms in the equations. The topographic Rossby wave terms are given by:

In this section, we will explore some of the key phenomena associated with geostrophic adjustment.

##### Geostrophic Balance

The geostrophic balance is a fundamental concept in geostrophic adjustment. It is a state in which the Coriolis force is balanced by the pressure gradient force. This balance is represented by the first two equations of the geostrophic adjustment model:

$$
-{g \over f_0}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial y \partial t}+{\partial \tilde{u} \over\partial t}-f_0\tilde{v} = 0\\[3pt]
{g \over f_0}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial x \partial t}+{\partial \tilde{v} \over\partial t}+f_0\tilde{u} = 0\\[3pt]
$$

##### Topographic Rossby Waves

Topographic Rossby waves are a key feature of geostrophic adjustment. They are large-scale motions that are influenced by the Earth's topography. The topographic Rossby wave terms in the geostrophic adjustment model are given by:

$$
\tilde{v} = -{g \over f_0^2}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial y \partial t}\\[3pt]
\tilde{u} = -{g \over f_0^2}{\partial^2 \eta \over \partial x \partial t}\\[3pt]
{\partial \eta\over\partial t}+H_0\left({\partial \tilde{u} \over\partial x} + {\partial \tilde{v} \over\partial y}\right)+\alpha_0 {g \over f_0}{\partial \eta \over \partial x}=0.

Interpreting the results of geostrophic adjustment experiments can be a complex task. The experiments often produce a wealth of data, much of which may be difficult to interpret directly. However, by comparing the results of the experiments with the theoretical predictions, it is often possible to gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of large-scale motions on a rotating earth.

For example, consider the results of a geostrophic adjustment experiment conducted by Johns et al. (2009). These authors reported a year-long average MOC of 18.7 ± 5.6 Sv with a large variability ranging from 4.4 to 35.3 Sv within the course of a year. This variability is consistent with the theoretical predictions of the geostrophic adjustment model, which predict a large variability in the MOC due to the non-linear interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean.

##### Geostrophic Adjustment Experiments and Climate Change

Geostrophic adjustment experiments also have important implications for our understanding of climate change. As the Earth's climate changes, the dynamics of large-scale motions in the atmosphere and the ocean are likely to be affected. By conducting geostrophic adjustment experiments under different climate conditions, we can gain insights into these changes and their potential impacts on the Earth's climate system.

For instance, the RAPID program, which has been monitoring the ocean circulation since 2004, has provided valuable data for geostrophic adjustment experiments. This data has been used to study the effects of climate change on the MOC, and has led to important insights into the dynamics of large-scale motions on a rotating earth.

In conclusion, geostrophic adjustment experiments are a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of large-scale motions on a rotating earth. By combining these experiments with theoretical models and observations, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean, and their role in shaping the Earth's climate system.

## Chapter 7: Mesoscale Motions

### Introduction

In the vast expanse of our planet, there exist intricate and complex systems that govern the movement of air and water. These systems, known as mesoscale motions, are the focus of this chapter. Mesoscale motions are large-scale atmospheric and oceanic phenomena that occur on a scale of tens to hundreds of kilometers.

#### 6.3d Geostrophic Adjustment Applications

Geostrophic adjustment has a wide range of applications in the study of atmospheric and oceanic circulations. It is used to understand the dynamics of large-scale motions, such as the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) and the Atlantic Meridional Heat Transport (AMHT). 

##### Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC)

The MOC is a large-scale oceanic circulation that plays a crucial role in the global climate system. It is responsible for transporting heat from the equator towards the poles, and is a key component of the Earth's heat budget. The MOC is also closely linked to the Atlantic Meridional Heat Transport (AMHT), which is the total heat transported from the equator towards the poles in the Atlantic Ocean.

Geostrophic adjustment is used to understand the dynamics of the MOC and the AMHT. For example, Johns et al. (2009) used geostrophic adjustment to study the MOC and the AMHT in the Labrador Sea. They found that the MOC and the AMHT exhibit large variability, with a year-long average MOC of 18.7 ± 5.6 Sv and a year-long average AMHT of 1.1 ± 0.3 PW. This variability is consistent with the theoretical predictions of the geostrophic adjustment model, which predict a large variability in the MOC and the AMHT due to the non-linear interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean.

##### Atlantic Meridional Heat Transport (AMHT)

The AMHT is another important application of geostrophic adjustment. It is responsible for transporting heat from the equator towards the poles in the Atlantic Ocean, and is a key component of the Earth's heat budget. The AMHT is closely linked to the MOC, as changes in the MOC can have a significant impact on the AMHT.

Geostrophic adjustment is used to understand the dynamics of the AMHT. For example, Cunningham et al. (2007) used geostrophic adjustment to study the AMHT in the Labrador Sea. They found that the AMHT exhibits large variability, with a year-long average of 1.1 ± 0.3 PW. This variability is consistent with the theoretical predictions of the geostrophic adjustment model, which predict a large variability in the AMHT due to the non-linear interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean.

In conclusion, geostrophic adjustment is a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of large-scale motions in the atmosphere and the ocean. It provides valuable insights into the complex interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean, and has a wide range of applications in the study of atmospheric and oceanic circulations.

#### 6.4d Ekman Pumping and Climate Change

Climate change is a global phenomenon that has far-reaching implications for the Earth's oceans and atmosphere. The increase in global temperatures, primarily driven by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, has led to significant changes in oceanic and atmospheric circulations. Ekman pumping, a key process in the dynamics of large-scale motions on a rotating Earth, plays a crucial role in these changes.

##### Ekman Pumping and the Meridional Overturning Circulation under Climate Change

Climate change is expected to have a significant impact on the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC). As global temperatures rise, the density of the water column changes, which can alter the strength of the MOC. This, in turn, can affect the vertical mixing of the water column, which is driven by Ekman pumping.

The MOC can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\vec{M} = \vec{E} \times \vec{z}
$$

where $\vec{M}$ is the MOC, $\vec{E}$ is the Ekman transport, and $\vec{z}$ is the vertical coordinate. As the MOC weakens, the Ekman transport decreases, which can lead to a decrease in the vertical mixing of the water column. This can have significant implications for the global climate system, as the MOC is responsible for transporting heat from the equator towards the poles.

##### Ekman Pumping and the Atlantic Meridional Heat Transport under Climate Change

Climate change is also expected to impact the Atlantic Meridional Heat Transport (AMHT). As global temperatures rise, the amount of heat transported from the tropics towards the poles in the Atlantic Ocean is likely to change. This can affect the vertical mixing of the water column, which is driven by Ekman pumping.

The AMHT can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\vec{H} = \vec{E} \times \vec{y}
$$

where $\vec{H}$ is the AMHT, $\vec{E}$ is the Ekman transport, and $\vec{y}$ is the north-south coordinate. As the AMHT changes, the Ekman transport can also change, which can affect the vertical mixing of the water column. This can have significant implications for the global climate system, as the AMHT is responsible for transporting heat from the tropics towards the poles in the Atlantic Ocean.

##### Ekman Pumping and the Oceanic Heat Budget under Climate Change

Climate change is likely to alter the oceanic heat budget, which is a key component of the global climate system. As the MOC and AMHT change, the oceanic heat budget can also change, which can have significant implications for the global climate system. Ekman pumping plays a crucial role in the oceanic heat budget, as it drives the vertical mixing of the water column.

The oceanic heat budget can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\vec{B} = \vec{M} + \vec{H}
$$

where $\vec{B}$ is the oceanic heat budget, $\vec{M}$ is the MOC, and $\vec{H}$ is the AMHT. As the MOC and AMHT change, the oceanic heat budget can also change, which can have significant implications for the global climate system.
