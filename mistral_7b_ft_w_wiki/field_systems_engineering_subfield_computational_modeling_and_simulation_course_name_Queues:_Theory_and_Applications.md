## Chapter: Queueing Theory: From Fundamentals to Advanced Applications




### Introduction

Queueing theory is a mathematical framework used to model and analyze systems where customers or jobs arrive, wait in a queue, and are eventually served. It has been widely applied in various fields such as telecommunication networks, computer systems, and manufacturing systems. In this chapter, we will focus on the M/M/s type systems, which are fundamental to understanding queueing theory.

The M/M/s type systems are a class of queueing models where customers arrive at a single queue, wait in the queue, and are served by a single server. The M/M/s type systems are characterized by two key assumptions:

1. The arrival process is memoryless (M). This means that the probability of an arrival in a given interval is independent of the number of customers already in the system.
2. The service time is exponentially distributed (M). This means that the service time for each customer is a random variable with an exponential distribution.

The M/M/s type systems are particularly useful because they allow us to derive analytical results for the key performance measures of a queueing system, such as the average queue length, the average waiting time, and the average number of customers in the system. These results are often used to make decisions about system design and resource allocation.

In this chapter, we will delve into the details of the M/M/s type systems, starting with the M/M/1 system, which is the simplest and most fundamental system of this type. We will then move on to more complex systems with multiple servers, such as the M/M/2 and M/M/c systems. We will also discuss the implications of these systems for real-world applications.

By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of the M/M/s type systems and be able to apply this knowledge to analyze and optimize queueing systems in your own work.




### Subsection: 1.1a Definition and Components of Queueing Systems

Queueing systems are mathematical models used to analyze the behavior of systems where customers or jobs arrive, wait in a queue, and are eventually served. These systems are ubiquitous in various fields such as telecommunication networks, computer systems, and manufacturing systems. The M/M/s type systems are a class of queueing models that are fundamental to understanding queueing theory.

#### Definition of Queueing Systems

A queueing system is a mathematical model that describes the behavior of a system where customers or jobs arrive, wait in a queue, and are eventually served. The system is characterized by three key components: the arrival process, the queue, and the service process.

1. The arrival process describes how customers or jobs arrive at the system. In the M/M/s type systems, the arrival process is memoryless, meaning that the probability of an arrival in a given interval is independent of the number of customers already in the system.

2. The queue is the waiting area where customers or jobs wait until they are served. In the M/M/s type systems, the queue is single-server, meaning that all customers are served by a single server.

3. The service process describes how customers or jobs are served. In the M/M/s type systems, the service time is exponentially distributed, meaning that the service time for each customer is a random variable with an exponential distribution.

#### Components of Queueing Systems

The M/M/s type systems are characterized by two key assumptions:

1. The arrival process is memoryless (M). This means that the probability of an arrival in a given interval is independent of the number of customers already in the system. This assumption is often referred to as the Poisson assumption, as it leads to the arrivals following a Poisson process.

2. The service time is exponentially distributed (M). This means that the service time for each customer is a random variable with an exponential distribution. This assumption is often referred to as the exponential service time assumption, as it leads to the service times following an exponential distribution.

These assumptions allow us to derive analytical results for the key performance measures of a queueing system, such as the average queue length, the average waiting time, and the average number of customers in the system. These results are often used to make decisions about system design and resource allocation.

In the following sections, we will delve into the details of the M/M/s type systems, starting with the M/M/1 system, which is the simplest and most fundamental system of this type. We will then move on to more complex systems with multiple servers, such as the M/M/2 and M/M/c systems. We will also discuss the implications of these systems for real-world applications.




### Subsection: 1.1b Characteristics of Queueing Systems

Queueing systems, particularly the M/M/s type systems, exhibit several key characteristics that are fundamental to their operation and analysis. These characteristics are often used to classify and compare different queueing systems.

#### 1.1b.1 Utilization

Utilization is a measure of the system's efficiency. It is defined as the ratio of the time the server is busy serving customers to the total time. In the M/M/s type systems, the utilization is given by the Erlang-C formula:

$$
U = \frac{\lambda}{\mu - \lambda} \left(1 - \frac{1}{s}\right)
$$

where $\lambda$ is the arrival rate, $\mu$ is the service rate, and $s$ is the number of servers.

#### 1.1b.2 Response Time

Response time is the average time a customer spends in the system, from arrival to departure. In the M/M/s type systems, the response time is given by Little's Law:

$$
W = \frac{\lambda}{\mu(\mu - \lambda)}
$$

where $W$ is the response time, $\lambda$ is the arrival rate, and $\mu$ is the service rate.

#### 1.1b.3 Queue Length

Queue length is the average number of customers in the queue. In the M/M/s type systems, the queue length is given by the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula:

$$
L = \frac{\lambda^2}{\mu(\mu - \lambda)}
$$

where $L$ is the queue length, $\lambda$ is the arrival rate, and $\mu$ is the service rate.

#### 1.1b.4 Little's Law

Little's Law is a fundamental result in queueing theory that relates the arrival rate, service rate, and response time in a queueing system. It states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the arrival rate times the average response time:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

where $L$ is the queue length, $\lambda$ is the arrival rate, and $W$ is the response time.

#### 1.1b.5 Erlang's Loss Formula

Erlang's Loss Formula is another fundamental result in queueing theory that relates the arrival rate, service rate, and number of servers in a queueing system. It states that the probability of a customer being lost (i.e., not being served) is equal to the ratio of the arrival rate to the service rate, raised to the power of the number of servers minus one, divided by the number of servers:

$$
P_l = \frac{\lambda^s}{s!\mu^s}
$$

where $P_l$ is the probability of loss, $\lambda$ is the arrival rate, $\mu$ is the service rate, and $s$ is the number of servers.

These characteristics provide a framework for understanding and analyzing queueing systems. They are particularly useful in the M/M/s type systems, where they can be used to derive important results such as the Erlang-C formula, Little's Law, and Erlang's Loss Formula.




### Subsection: 1.2a Definition and Properties of Markovian Arrival Process

The Markovian Arrival Process (MAP) is a fundamental concept in queueing theory. It is a type of stochastic process that describes the arrival of customers to a queueing system. The MAP is particularly useful in the analysis of queueing systems due to its simplicity and the ability to model a wide range of arrival patterns.

#### 1.2a.1 Definition of Markovian Arrival Process

The Markovian Arrival Process is a type of point process that describes the arrival of customers to a queueing system. It is a special case of the Poisson process, where the arrival rate is not constant but depends on the state of the system. The MAP is defined by a transition matrix $P(t)$, where $P_{i,j}(t)$ is the probability of transitioning from state $i$ to state $j$ in time $t$.

#### 1.2a.2 Properties of Markovian Arrival Process

The Markovian Arrival Process has several important properties that make it a useful tool in queueing theory. These properties are:

1. Memorylessness: The future state of the process depends only on its current state, not on its past states. This property is known as the Markov property.
2. Stationarity: The transition probabilities $P_{i,j}(t)$ do not change over time. This property is useful in the analysis of queueing systems, as it allows us to make long-term predictions about the arrival process.
3. Independence: The arrivals at different points in time are independent of each other. This property is a consequence of the memorylessness property and is useful in the analysis of queueing systems, as it allows us to model a wide range of arrival patterns.

#### 1.2a.3 Applications of Markovian Arrival Process

The Markovian Arrival Process has many applications in queueing theory. It is used to model the arrival process in a wide range of queueing systems, including telecommunication networks, computer systems, and manufacturing systems. The MAP is also used in the analysis of queueing systems, as it allows us to make predictions about the arrival process and its impact on the system.

In the next section, we will explore the relationship between the Markovian Arrival Process and the Markovian Arrival Theorem, a fundamental result in queueing theory that relates the arrival process to the queue length in a queueing system.




### Subsection: 1.2b Arrival Rate and Arrival Time Distribution

The arrival rate and arrival time distribution are two crucial parameters of the Markovian Arrival Process. They provide valuable insights into the behavior of the arrival process and are essential in the analysis of queueing systems.

#### 1.2b.1 Arrival Rate

The arrival rate, often denoted as $\lambda$, is the average number of arrivals per unit time. It is a key parameter of the MAP and is used to determine the overall arrival pattern in a queueing system. The arrival rate is typically estimated from the arrival process data and can be used to calculate the arrival probability distribution.

#### 1.2b.2 Arrival Time Distribution

The arrival time distribution, often denoted as $A(t)$, is the probability distribution of the time between successive arrivals. It is a crucial parameter of the MAP and provides insights into the variability of the arrival process. The arrival time distribution is typically estimated from the arrival process data and can be used to calculate the arrival rate and other important parameters.

#### 1.2b.3 Relationship between Arrival Rate and Arrival Time Distribution

The arrival rate and arrival time distribution are closely related. The arrival rate is a measure of the average number of arrivals per unit time, while the arrival time distribution provides information about the variability of the arrival process. In general, a higher arrival rate indicates a more variable arrival process, while a lower arrival rate indicates a more predictable arrival process.

#### 1.2b.4 Applications of Arrival Rate and Arrival Time Distribution

The arrival rate and arrival time distribution have many applications in queueing theory. They are used to model the arrival process in a wide range of queueing systems, including telecommunication networks, computer systems, and manufacturing systems. The arrival rate and arrival time distribution are also used in the analysis of queueing systems, as they provide valuable insights into the behavior of the arrival process.




### Subsection: 1.3a Definition and Properties of Exponential Service Time

The exponential service time is a fundamental concept in queueing theory, particularly in the M/M/s type systems. It is a key parameter that determines the service time distribution in a queueing system. In this section, we will define the exponential service time and discuss its properties.

#### 1.3a.1 Definition of Exponential Service Time

The exponential service time is a type of service time distribution where the service time for each job follows an exponential distribution. The exponential distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is often used to model the time between events in a Poisson process. In the context of queueing theory, the exponential service time is often used to model the time it takes for a job to be served at a service facility.

The exponential service time is particularly useful in queueing theory because it allows us to model systems where the service time for each job is independent of the service time for other jobs. This assumption is often reasonable in many real-world systems, where the service time for each job is not affected by the service time for other jobs.

#### 1.3a.2 Properties of Exponential Service Time

The exponential service time has several important properties that make it a useful tool in queueing theory. These properties include:

1. The mean service time is equal to the variance of the service time. This property is unique to the exponential service time and is not shared by other service time distributions.
2. The service time is memoryless. This means that the service time for a job is independent of the service time for previous jobs. This property is particularly useful in queueing systems where the service time for each job is not affected by the service time for other jobs.
3. The service time is continuous. This means that the service time for each job is a positive real number. This property is useful in queueing systems where the service time for each job is not limited to a discrete set of values.

#### 1.3a.3 Applications of Exponential Service Time

The exponential service time has many applications in queueing theory. It is used to model the service time in a wide range of queueing systems, including telecommunication networks, computer systems, and manufacturing systems. The exponential service time is also used in the analysis of queueing systems, particularly in the M/M/s type systems.

In the next section, we will discuss the implications of the exponential service time on the performance of queueing systems. We will also discuss how the exponential service time can be used to calculate important performance measures, such as the average response time and the average queue length.




### Subsection: 1.3b Service Rate and Service Time Distribution

In the previous section, we discussed the exponential service time and its properties. In this section, we will explore the relationship between the service rate and the service time distribution.

#### 1.3b.1 Service Rate

The service rate, often denoted as $\mu$, is a key parameter in queueing theory. It represents the average number of jobs that can be served per unit time at a service facility. In other words, it is the inverse of the average service time.

The service rate is a crucial concept in queueing theory as it helps us understand the behavior of a queueing system. It is particularly useful in the M/M/s type systems, where the service rate is often used to determine the queue length and the average waiting time.

#### 1.3b.2 Service Time Distribution

The service time distribution is a probability distribution that describes the service time for each job at a service facility. In the M/M/s type systems, the service time distribution is often assumed to be exponential, as discussed in the previous section.

The service time distribution is an important concept in queueing theory as it helps us understand the behavior of a queueing system. It is particularly useful in the M/M/s type systems, where the service time distribution is often used to determine the queue length and the average waiting time.

#### 1.3b.3 Relationship between Service Rate and Service Time Distribution

The service rate and the service time distribution are closely related. In the M/M/s type systems, the service rate is often used to determine the service time distribution. This is because the service rate is a measure of the average number of jobs that can be served per unit time, while the service time distribution describes the service time for each job.

In the M/M/s type systems, the service rate is often used to determine the queue length and the average waiting time. This is because the service rate is a measure of the average number of jobs that can be served per unit time, while the service time distribution describes the service time for each job.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of the service rate and the service time distribution in the M/M/s type systems. We will also discuss how these concepts can be used to analyze and optimize queueing systems.





#### 1.4a Analysis of M/M/1 Queue

The M/M/1 queue is a fundamental concept in queueing theory, and it serves as the basis for more complex queueing systems. In this section, we will delve into the analysis of the M/M/1 queue, exploring its properties and characteristics.

#### 1.4a.1 Definition and Properties of M/M/1 Queue

The M/M/1 queue is a single-server queueing system where customers arrive according to a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$ and service times are exponentially distributed with mean $1/\mu$. This queueing system is often used to model systems where customers arrive randomly and service times are unpredictable.

The M/M/1 queue has several key properties that make it a useful model in queueing theory. These include:

- The queue length is always finite.
- The queue length is Poisson distributed with mean $\lambda/\mu$.
- The average number of customers in the system (in service and in queue) is given by $\frac{\lambda}{\mu - \lambda}$.
- The average waiting time in the queue is given by $\frac{\lambda}{\mu(\mu - \lambda)}$.
- The average waiting time in the system (including service time) is given by $\frac{1}{\mu - \lambda}$.

#### 1.4a.2 Stationary Analysis of M/M/1 Queue

The stationary analysis of the M/M/1 queue involves determining the probability mass function $\pi_k$ of the number of customers in the system. This is given by:

$$
\pi_k = \begin{cases}
(1-\rho)\rho^k, & \text{if } k < c \\
\frac{(1-\rho)\rho^k}{c^{k-c}}, & \text{if } k \geq c
\end{cases}
$$

where $\rho = \frac{\lambda}{c\mu}$ is the traffic intensity and $c$ is the number of servers.

The probability that an arriving customer is forced to join the queue (all servers are occupied) is given by Erlang's C formula and is often denoted C($c$, $\lambda/\mu$) or E<sub>2,`c`</sub>($\lambda/\mu$). The average number of customers in the system (in service and in queue) is given by $\frac{\rho}{1-\rho} \text{ C}(c,\lambda/\mu) + c \rho$.

#### 1.4a.3 Busy Period of Server

The busy period of the M/M/c queue can refer to the time period during which the server is busy serving customers. The busy period can be calculated using the Laplace–Stieltjes transform of the distribution of $T_k$ = the time at which there are $k$ jobs in the system. This is given by $\eta_k(s)$ for the Laplace–Stieltjes transform of the distribution of $T_k$. Then:

$$
\eta_k(s) = \frac{s^k}{k!} \eta_0(s)
$$

where $\eta_0(s)$ is the Laplace–Stieltjes transform of the service time distribution.

#### 1.4a.4 Response Time

The response time is the total amount of time a customer spends in both the queue and in service. The average response time is the same for all work conserving service disciplines and is given by:

$$
\frac{\text{ C}(c,\lambda/\mu)}{c \mu - \lambda} + \frac{1}{\mu}
$$

In the next section, we will explore the M/M/c queue, a generalization of the M/M/1 queue that allows for multiple servers.

#### 1.4b Performance Measures in M/M/1 Queue

The M/M/1 queue is a fundamental concept in queueing theory, and it is essential to understand its performance measures to analyze and optimize queueing systems. In this section, we will delve into the performance measures of the M/M/1 queue, including the average number of customers in the system, the average waiting time, and the average queue length.

##### Average Number of Customers in the System

The average number of customers in the system (in service and in queue) is a crucial performance measure of the M/M/1 queue. It represents the total number of customers in the system, including those being served and those waiting in the queue. The average number of customers in the system can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. In the case of the M/M/1 queue, this can be expressed as:

$$
L = \frac{\lambda}{\mu - \lambda}
$$

where $L$ is the average number of customers in the system, $\lambda$ is the arrival rate, and $\mu$ is the service rate.

##### Average Waiting Time

The average waiting time in the queue is another important performance measure of the M/M/1 queue. It represents the average time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. The average waiting time can be calculated using the Little's Law formula for waiting time, which states that the average waiting time is equal to the average number of customers in the queue divided by the average arrival rate. In the case of the M/M/1 queue, this can be expressed as:

$$
W = \frac{L}{\lambda}
$$

where $W$ is the average waiting time, $L$ is the average number of customers in the system, and $\lambda$ is the arrival rate.

##### Average Queue Length

The average queue length is the average number of customers waiting in the queue. It is a crucial performance measure of the M/M/1 queue, as it directly affects the customer experience and the overall efficiency of the queueing system. The average queue length can be calculated using the Little's Law formula for queue length, which states that the average queue length is equal to the average number of customers in the queue minus the average number of servers. In the case of the M/M/1 queue, this can be expressed as:

$$
L_q = L - \frac{\lambda}{\mu}
$$

where $L_q$ is the average queue length, $L$ is the average number of customers in the system, $\lambda$ is the arrival rate, and $\mu$ is the service rate.

In the next section, we will explore the M/M/c queue, a generalization of the M/M/1 queue that allows for multiple servers.

#### 1.4c Applications of M/M/1 Queue

The M/M/1 queue is a fundamental concept in queueing theory and has a wide range of applications in various fields. In this section, we will explore some of the key applications of the M/M/1 queue.

##### Telecommunication Networks

In telecommunication networks, the M/M/1 queue is often used to model the behavior of call centers. The arrival rate $\lambda$ represents the rate at which calls are received, and the service rate $\mu$ represents the rate at which calls are answered. The average number of customers in the system $L$ can then be used to determine the average number of calls in the call center, which can be used to optimize the call center's resources.

##### Computer Systems

In computer systems, the M/M/1 queue is used to model the behavior of processors. The arrival rate $\lambda$ represents the rate at which tasks are submitted to the processor, and the service rate $\mu$ represents the rate at which tasks are processed. The average waiting time $W$ can then be used to determine the average time a task spends waiting in the queue, which can be used to optimize the processor's performance.

##### Manufacturing Systems

In manufacturing systems, the M/M/1 queue is used to model the behavior of machines. The arrival rate $\lambda$ represents the rate at which jobs are submitted to the machine, and the service rate $\mu$ represents the rate at which jobs are processed. The average queue length $L_q$ can then be used to determine the average number of jobs waiting in the queue, which can be used to optimize the machine's efficiency.

##### Healthcare Systems

In healthcare systems, the M/M/1 queue is used to model the behavior of patients in a waiting room. The arrival rate $\lambda$ represents the rate at which patients arrive, and the service rate $\mu$ represents the rate at which patients are served. The average waiting time $W$ can then be used to determine the average time a patient spends waiting in the queue, which can be used to optimize the healthcare system's resources.

In the next section, we will explore the M/M/c queue, a generalization of the M/M/1 queue that allows for multiple servers.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the fundamental insights of queueing theory, specifically focusing on the M/M/s type systems.

In the next chapters, we will build upon these foundational concepts and explore more complex queueing systems. We will also delve into advanced applications of queueing theory, demonstrating its power and versatility in a wide range of fields, from telecommunications to healthcare.

#### Exercise 5
Consider an M/M/2 queueing system with two servers, each with a service rate of $\mu$ customers per hour. If the arrival rate is $\lambda$ customers per hour, derive the expression for the probability that both servers are busy.

## Chapter: Chapter 2: The M/G/1 Queue

### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we introduced the fundamental concepts of queueing theory, focusing on the M/M/s type systems. Now, we will delve deeper into the M/G/1 queue, a single-server queueing system where the arrival process is memoryless and the service time distribution is general. This chapter will provide a comprehensive understanding of the M/G/1 queue, its characteristics, and its applications.

The performance of a queueing system is often evaluated based on several key performance measures. These measures provide insights into the system's efficiency, effectiveness, and ability to meet customer demands. In this section, we will explore the performance measures of the M/M/1 queue.

#### 1.4b.1 Average Number of Customers in the System

The average number of customers in the system (in service and in queue) is a crucial performance measure. It represents the average number of customers that the system is serving or waiting to be served. In the M/M/1 queue, this measure is given by $\frac{\lambda}{\mu - \lambda}$. 

This measure is particularly important as it provides a measure of the system's utilization. If the average number of customers in the system is close to the number of servers, it indicates that the system is heavily utilized and may be experiencing delays.

#### 1.4b.2 Average Waiting Time in the Queue

The average waiting time in the queue is another key performance measure. It represents the average time that a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. In the M/M/1 queue, this measure is given by $\frac{\lambda}{\mu(\mu - \lambda)}$.

This measure is particularly important as it provides a measure of the system's responsiveness. A longer average waiting time in the queue may indicate that the system is slow to respond to customer demands.

#### 1.4b.3 Average Waiting Time in the System

The average waiting time in the system (including service time) is a comprehensive performance measure. It represents the average time that a customer spends in the system, including both the waiting time in the queue and the service time. In the M/M/1 queue, this measure is given by $\frac{1}{\mu - \lambda}$.

This measure is particularly important as it provides a measure of the system's overall efficiency. A longer average waiting time in the system may indicate that the system is inefficient and may need to be optimized.

#### 1.4b.4 Probability of Waiting in the Queue

The probability of waiting in the queue is a measure of the likelihood that a customer will have to wait in the queue before being served. In the M/M/1 queue, this measure is given by $1 - \frac{\mu}{\lambda + \mu}$.

This measure is particularly important as it provides a measure of the system's customer satisfaction. A higher probability of waiting in the queue may indicate that customers are often experiencing delays, which may lead to dissatisfaction.

#### 1.4b.5 Probability of Delay

The probability of delay is a measure of the likelihood that a customer will experience a delay in the system. In the M/M/1 queue, this measure is given by $\frac{\lambda}{\mu(\lambda + \mu)}$.

This measure is particularly important as it provides a measure of the system's reliability. A higher probability of delay may indicate that the system is not reliable and may need to be improved.

#### 1.4b.6 Little's Law

Little's Law is a fundamental law in queueing theory that relates the average number of customers in the system, the average arrival rate, and the average service rate. In the M/M/1 queue, Little's Law can be expressed as $\frac{\lambda}{\mu - \lambda} = L = L_q + L_s$, where $L$ is the average number of customers in the system, $L_q$ is the average number of customers in the queue, and $L_s$ is the average number of customers in service.

This law is particularly important as it provides a fundamental relationship between the key performance measures of the system. It allows us to express the average number of customers in the system in terms of the average arrival rate and service rate, which are often easier to measure or control.




#### 1.5a Analysis of M/M/s Queue

The M/M/s queue is a fundamental model in queueing theory, particularly in the context of multiple server queues. It is a special case of the M/G/s queue, where the service time distribution follows a general distribution. In the M/M/s queue, both the arrival and service processes are memoryless, which simplifies the analysis of the queue.

#### 1.5a.1 Performance Measures of M/M/s Queue

The performance of the M/M/s queue can be evaluated using the same performance measures as the M/M/1 queue, with the addition of the average number of servers busy. This measure represents the average number of servers that are busy serving customers. In the M/M/s queue, this measure is given by $\frac{\lambda}{s(\mu - \lambda)}$.

#### 1.5a.2 Utilization of the M/M/s Queue

The utilization of the M/M/s queue is a crucial performance measure. It represents the proportion of time that the servers are busy serving customers. In the M/M/s queue, the utilization is given by $\frac{\lambda}{\mu}$.

The utilization is a key factor in determining the performance of the queue. If the utilization is high, it indicates that the queue is heavily utilized and may be experiencing delays. Conversely, if the utilization is low, it indicates that the queue is lightly utilized and may not be able to handle the arrival rate of customers.

#### 1.5a.3 Little's Law for the M/M/s Queue

Little's Law, a fundamental result in queueing theory, also applies to the M/M/s queue. Little's Law states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. In the M/M/s queue, this law can be expressed as $\frac{\lambda}{\mu - \lambda} = \frac{\lambda}{\mu} \cdot \frac{1}{\lambda}$.

This law provides a powerful tool for analyzing the performance of the M/M/s queue. By understanding the average arrival rate and the average time a customer spends in the system, we can gain insights into the performance of the queue.

#### 1.5a.4 Queue Discipline in the M/M/s Queue

The queue discipline, or the rule used to determine the order in which customers are served, is an important aspect of the M/M/s queue. In the M/M/s queue, customers are typically served in the order of their arrival, which is known as the first-come-first-served (FCFS) discipline. However, other disciplines, such as last-come-first-served (LCFS) or shortest job first (SJF), can also be used.

The choice of queue discipline can have a significant impact on the performance of the queue. For example, in the M/M/s queue, the FCFS discipline can lead to longer waiting times and delays compared to the LCFS or SJF disciplines.

#### 1.5a.5 Fair Queueing in the M/M/s Queue

Fair queuing is a key concept in the M/M/s queue. It refers to the principle that all customers should be served in a fair and equitable manner. In the M/M/s queue, fair queuing can be achieved by using a fair queuing algorithm, such as the byte-weighted fair queuing algorithm.

The byte-weighted fair queuing algorithm attempts to emulate the fairness of bitwise round-robin sharing of link resources among competing flows. It selects the transmission order for the packets by modeling the finish time for each packet as if they could be transmitted bitwise round-robin. The packet with the earliest finish time according to this modeling is the next selected for transmission.

The complexity of the algorithm is "O(log(n))", where "n" is the number of queues/flows. To reduce the computational load, the concept of "virtual time" is introduced. Finish time for each packet is computed on this alternate monotonically increasing virtual timescale. While virtual time does not accurately model the time packets complete their transmissions, it does accurately model the order in which the transmissions must occur to meet the objectives of the full-featured model.

The virtual finish time for a newly queued packet is given by the sum of the virtual start time plus the packet's size. The virtual start time is the maximum between the previous virtual finish time of the same queue and the current instant. With a virtual finishing time of all candidate packets (i.e., the packets at the head of the queues), the algorithm selects the packet with the earliest virtual finish time for transmission.

In conclusion, the M/M/s queue is a fundamental model in queueing theory, and its analysis provides valuable insights into the performance of multiple server queues. By understanding the performance measures, utilization, Little's Law, queue discipline, and fair queuing, we can gain a deeper understanding of the M/M/s queue and its applications.




#### 1.5b Performance Measures of M/M/s Queue

The performance of the M/M/s queue can be evaluated using several key performance measures. These measures provide a quantitative understanding of the queue's behavior and can be used to make informed decisions about the queue's design and operation.

##### Average Number of Customers in the System

The average number of customers in the system, denoted as $L$, is a measure of the queue's congestion. It represents the average number of customers in the queue, including those being served and those waiting in the queue. In the M/M/s queue, the average number of customers in the system is given by the formula:

$$
L = \frac{\lambda}{\mu - \lambda}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the arrival rate and $\mu$ is the service rate.

##### Average Waiting Time in the Queue

The average waiting time in the queue, denoted as $W$, is a measure of the delay experienced by customers. It represents the average time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. In the M/M/s queue, the average waiting time in the queue is given by the formula:

$$
W = \frac{L}{\lambda}
$$

##### Average Number of Servers Busy

The average number of servers busy, denoted as $B$, is a measure of the queue's utilization. It represents the average number of servers that are busy serving customers. In the M/M/s queue, the average number of servers busy is given by the formula:

$$
B = \frac{\lambda}{s(\mu - \lambda)}
$$

where $s$ is the number of servers.

##### Utilization of the Queue

The utilization of the queue, denoted as $\rho$, is a measure of the queue's efficiency. It represents the proportion of time that the servers are busy serving customers. In the M/M/s queue, the utilization is given by the formula:

$$
\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}
$$

These performance measures provide a comprehensive understanding of the queue's behavior. By monitoring these measures, we can identify potential issues and make adjustments to improve the queue's performance.

#### 1.5c Multiple Server Queue Models

In the previous sections, we have discussed the performance measures of the M/M/s queue. Now, we will delve into the multiple server queue models, which are extensions of the M/M/s queue. These models are particularly useful in scenarios where there are multiple servers available to serve the incoming customers.

##### M/M/s Queue with Finite Buffer

In the M/M/s queue with finite buffer, the queue is assumed to have a finite buffer space. This means that if the queue is full, any incoming customer will be lost. The average number of customers in the system for this model can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. The average time a customer spends in the system can be calculated using the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula.

##### M/M/s Queue with Priority

In the M/M/s queue with priority, customers are served based on their priority. Customers with higher priority are served first. The performance of this queue can be analyzed using the concept of virtual time, as discussed in the context. The finish time for each packet is computed on a virtual timescale, and the packet with the earliest finish time is selected for transmission. This approach reduces the computational load and allows for efficient packet transmission.

##### M/M/s Queue with Service Time Variation

In the M/M/s queue with service time variation, the service time for each customer can vary. This can be modeled using the concept of virtual finish time, as discussed in the context. The finish time for each packet is computed on a virtual timescale, and the packet with the earliest finish time is selected for transmission. This approach allows for efficient packet transmission, even when the service time for each packet varies.

##### M/M/s Queue with Multiple Types of Customers

In the M/M/s queue with multiple types of customers, customers are classified into different types based on their service requirements. Each type of customer is served by a separate set of servers. The performance of this queue can be analyzed using the concept of virtual finish time, as discussed in the context. The finish time for each packet is computed on a virtual timescale, and the packet with the earliest finish time is selected for transmission. This approach allows for efficient packet transmission, even when there are multiple types of customers.

In the next section, we will discuss the applications of these multiple server queue models in various fields.

## Chapter 2: Queueing Networks, Performance Measures, and Queueing Models for Real-World Systems:




### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the fundamental concepts of queueing theory, specifically Little's Law and its generalizations. These concepts are essential in understanding the behavior of queueing systems and predicting their performance. We will explore the mathematical foundations of these concepts and their practical applications in various fields.

Little's Law, named after the British mathematician John Little, is a fundamental law in queueing theory that relates the average number of customers in a system to the average time a customer spends in the system. It is a powerful tool for analyzing queueing systems and predicting their performance. We will explore the derivation of Little's Law and its implications in this chapter.

We will also delve into the generalizations of Little's Law, which allow us to analyze more complex queueing systems. These generalizations include the use of multiple servers, multiple queues, and non-Poisson arrival processes. We will explore the mathematical models and techniques used to analyze these systems and their practical applications.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of Little's Law and its generalizations, and how they can be applied to analyze and optimize queueing systems. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for the more advanced topics covered in the subsequent chapters of this book. So, let's dive into the world of queueing theory and explore the fascinating concepts of Little's Law and its generalizations.




### Subsection: 2.1a Definition and Calculation of Arrival Rate

The arrival rate, denoted by $\lambda$, is a fundamental concept in queueing theory. It represents the average number of customers arriving at a system per unit time. In other words, it is the rate at which customers enter the system. The arrival rate is a crucial parameter in Little's Law, as it is directly related to the average number of customers in the system.

The arrival rate can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
\lambda = \frac{\text{Total number of arrivals}}{\text{Total time period}}
$$

For example, if a system has 100 arrivals in a time period of 10 minutes, the arrival rate would be $\lambda = \frac{100}{10} = 10$ arrivals per minute.

In the context of Little's Law, the arrival rate is directly related to the average number of customers in the system, denoted by $L$. The law states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system, denoted by $W$. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
L = \lambda \cdot W
$$

This law is a powerful tool for analyzing queueing systems and predicting their performance. By understanding the arrival rate and its relationship with the average number of customers in the system, we can gain insights into the behavior of queueing systems and make informed decisions about their design and operation.

In the next section, we will explore the generalizations of Little's Law, which allow us to analyze more complex queueing systems. These generalizations include the use of multiple servers, multiple queues, and non-Poisson arrival processes. We will delve into the mathematical models and techniques used to analyze these systems and their practical applications.


## Chapter 2: Little’s Law and Generalizations:




### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we introduced the fundamental concepts of queueing theory, including the arrival rate and arrival process. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into these concepts and explore Little's Law and its generalizations. Little's Law is a fundamental principle in queueing theory that relates the average number of customers in a system to the arrival rate and service rate. It is a powerful tool for analyzing queueing systems and predicting their performance.

In this section, we will focus on the arrival rate and arrival process. The arrival rate, denoted by $\lambda$, is the average number of customers arriving at a system per unit time. It is a crucial parameter in Little's Law, as it is directly related to the average number of customers in the system. The arrival process, on the other hand, refers to the way in which customers arrive at the system. It can be modeled using various distributions, such as the Poisson process, which is a commonly used model for non-preemptive systems.

We will begin by discussing the Poisson process in more detail and exploring its properties. We will then move on to other arrival process models, such as the Poisson process with a general arrival rate and the Poisson process with a general service time distribution. We will also discuss the concept of self-similarity and its implications for queueing systems.

By the end of this section, readers will have a solid understanding of the arrival rate and arrival process, as well as their role in Little's Law and queueing theory. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for the rest of the chapter, where we will explore more advanced applications of Little's Law and its generalizations. 


## Chapter 2: Little’s Law and Generalizations:




### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we introduced the fundamental concepts of queueing theory, including the arrival rate and arrival process. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into these concepts and explore Little's Law and its generalizations. Little's Law is a fundamental principle in queueing theory that relates the average number of customers in a system to the arrival rate and service rate. It is a powerful tool for analyzing queueing systems and predicting their performance.

In this section, we will focus on the service rate and service time. The service rate, denoted by $\mu$, is the average number of customers that can be served by a system per unit time. It is a crucial parameter in Little's Law, as it is directly related to the average number of customers in the system. The service time, on the other hand, refers to the time it takes for a customer to be served at a system. It is a key factor in determining the performance of a queueing system.

## Chapter 2: Little’s Law and Generalizations:




### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we introduced the fundamental concepts of queueing theory, including the arrival rate and arrival process. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into these concepts and explore Little's Law and its generalizations. Little's Law is a fundamental principle in queueing theory that relates the average number of customers in a system to the arrival rate and service rate. It is a powerful tool for analyzing queueing systems and predicting their performance.

In this section, we will focus on the service rate and service time. The service rate, denoted by $\mu$, is the average number of customers that can be served by a system per unit time. It is a crucial parameter in Little's Law, as it is directly related to the average number of customers in the system. The service time, on the other hand, refers to the time it takes for a customer to be served at a system. It is a key factor in determining the performance of a queueing system.

#### 2.3a Definition and Calculation of Utilization

Utilization is a key concept in queueing theory that measures the efficiency of a system. It is defined as the ratio of the average number of customers being served to the average number of customers in the system. In other words, it represents the proportion of time that the system is busy serving customers.

Mathematically, utilization ($\rho$) can be expressed as:

$$
\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the arrival rate and $\mu$ is the service rate.

Utilization is a crucial parameter in Little's Law, as it is directly related to the average number of customers in the system. In fact, Little's Law can be rewritten in terms of utilization as:

$$
L = \frac{\rho}{\mu - \rho}
$$

where $L$ is the average number of customers in the system.

Utilization can range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a more efficient system. A utilization of 1 means that the system is always busy serving customers, while a utilization of 0 means that the system is never busy.

In queueing theory, utilization is often used to analyze the performance of a system. For example, a high utilization can indicate that the system is overloaded and may need to be expanded or optimized. On the other hand, a low utilization may suggest that the system is underutilized and could potentially handle more customers.

In the next section, we will explore the relationship between utilization and queue length, and how they can be used to analyze the performance of queueing systems.

#### 2.3b Utilization and Queue Length

The relationship between utilization and queue length is a fundamental concept in queueing theory. As we have seen in the previous section, utilization is a measure of the efficiency of a system, while queue length is a measure of the average number of customers in the system. 

The relationship between these two parameters can be understood by considering Little's Law. Little's Law states that the average number of customers in the system ($L$) is equal to the average arrival rate ($\lambda$) multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system ($\frac{1}{\mu - \rho}$). 

Utilization ($\rho$) is a key component of this equation, as it represents the proportion of time that the system is busy serving customers. Therefore, a higher utilization means a longer average time a customer spends in the system, which in turn leads to a higher queue length. 

Conversely, a lower utilization means a shorter average time a customer spends in the system, which leads to a lower queue length. 

This relationship between utilization and queue length is crucial in understanding the performance of a queueing system. A high utilization can indicate that the system is overloaded and may need to be expanded or optimized.

Utilization ($\rho$) is a key component of Little's Law. It represents the proportion of time that the system is busy serving customers. A higher utilization means a longer average time a customer spends in the system, which in turn leads to a higher average number of customers in the system. 

Conversely, a lower utilization means a shorter average time a customer spends in the system, which leads to a lower average number of customers in the system. 

This relationship between utilization and Little's Law is crucial in understanding the performance of a queueing system. A high utilization can indicate that the system is overloaded and may need to be expanded or optimized. On the other hand, a low utilization may suggest that the


#### 2.3b Relationship between Utilization and Queue Length

The relationship between utilization and queue length is a fundamental concept in queueing theory. As we have seen in the previous section, utilization is a measure of the efficiency of a system, while queue length is a measure of the average number of customers in the system. 

The relationship between these two parameters can be understood by considering Little's Law. Little's Law states that the average number of customers in the system ($L$) is equal to the average number of customers arriving at the system ($L_a$) plus the average number of customers waiting in the queue ($L_q$), divided by the average number of customers leaving the system ($L_d$). This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
L = \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}
$$

Utilization ($\rho$) is defined as the ratio of the average number of customers being served to the average number of customers in the system. This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\rho = \frac{L_d}{L}
$$

Substituting the expression for $L$ from Little's Law, we get:

$$
\rho = \frac{L_d}{\frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + L_q}
$$

Rearranging terms, we get:

$$
\rho = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + L_q} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}} = \frac{L_d^2}{L_a + \frac{





#### 2.4a Definition and Calculation of Response Time

Response time is a critical metric in queueing theory that measures the total time a job spends in the system from the instant of arrival to the time it leaves the system. It is a key performance indicator (KPI) that helps in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of a system. 

The response time can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in the system ($L$) is equal to the average number of customers arriving at the system ($L_a$) plus the average number of customers waiting in the queue ($L_q$), divided by the average number of customers leaving the system ($L_d$). This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
L = \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}
$$

The response time ($R$) can then be calculated as the sum of the average waiting time in the queue ($L_q$) and the average service time ($L_s$):

$$
R = L_q + L_s
$$

The average waiting time in the queue ($L_q$) can be calculated using Little's Law as:

$$
L_q = \frac{L_a \cdot L_w}{L_d}
$$

where $L_w$ is the average waiting time in the queue.

The average service time ($L_s$) can be calculated as the average number of customers in the system ($L$) minus the average number of customers waiting in the queue ($L_q$):

$$
L_s = L - L_q
$$

It's important to note that the response time is a random variable and its distribution can be skewed. Therefore, it's common to use the 90th percentile of the response time distribution as a measure of the system's performance. This is known as the "response time at the 90th percentile" or "90th percentile response time".

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of waiting time and its relationship with response time.

#### 2.4b Relationship between Response Time and Waiting Time

The relationship between response time and waiting time is a fundamental concept in queueing theory. As we have seen in the previous section, the response time ($R$) is the sum of the average waiting time in the queue ($L_q$) and the average service time ($L_s$):

$$
R = L_q + L_s
$$

The waiting time in the queue ($L_q$) is a key component of the response time. It is the time a job spends waiting in the queue before it is serviced. The waiting time can be calculated using Little's Law as:

$$
L_q = \frac{L_a \cdot L_w}{L_d}
$$

where $L_w$ is the average waiting time in the queue. The service time ($L_s$) is the time a job spends being serviced. It can be calculated as the average number of customers in the system ($L$) minus the average number of customers waiting in the queue ($L_q$):

$$
L_s = L - L_q
$$

The relationship between response time and waiting time can be further understood by considering the Little's Law. Little's Law states that the average number of customers in the system ($L$) is equal to the average number of customers arriving at the system ($L_a$) plus the average number of customers waiting in the queue ($L_q$), divided by the average number of customers leaving the system ($L_d$). This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
L = \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}
$$

From this equation, we can see that the response time ($R$) is directly proportional to the waiting time in the queue ($L_q$). This means that as the waiting time in the queue increases, the response time also increases. Conversely, if we can reduce the waiting time in the queue, we can also reduce the response time.

In the next section, we will discuss how to calculate the response time and waiting time in different types of queueing systems.

#### 2.4c Impact of Response Time and Waiting Time on System Performance

The response time and waiting time are critical metrics that directly impact the performance of a queueing system. As we have seen in the previous sections, the response time ($R$) is the sum of the average waiting time in the queue ($L_q$) and the average service time ($L_s$):

$$
R = L_q + L_s
$$

The waiting time in the queue ($L_q$) is a key component of the response time. It is the time a job spends waiting in the queue before it is serviced. The waiting time can be calculated using Little's Law as:

$$
L_q = \frac{L_a \cdot L_w}{L_d}
$$

where $L_w$ is the average waiting time in the queue. The service time ($L_s$) is the time a job spends being serviced. It can be calculated as the average number of customers in the system ($L$) minus the average number of customers waiting in the queue ($L_q$):

$$
L_s = L - L_q
$$

The relationship between response time and waiting time can be further understood by considering the Little's Law. Little's Law states that the average number of customers in the system ($L$) is equal to the average number of customers arriving at the system ($L_a$) plus the average number of customers waiting in the queue ($L_q$), divided by the average number of customers leaving the system ($L_d$). This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
L = \frac{L_a + L_q}{L_d}
$$

From this equation, we can see that the response time ($R$) is directly proportional to the waiting time in the queue ($L_q$). This means that as the waiting time in the queue increases, the response time also increases. Conversely, if we can reduce the waiting time in the queue, we can also reduce the response time.

The impact of response time and waiting time on system performance can be understood in terms of customer satisfaction and system efficiency. Customers are often willing to tolerate a certain amount of waiting time, but if the waiting time becomes excessive, they may become dissatisfied and seek alternative services. This can lead to a decrease in customer loyalty and a loss of business.

From a system efficiency perspective, a long response time can indicate that the system is not able to handle the workload, leading to queues and delays. This can result in a decrease in system throughput and an increase in system latency, which can have a negative impact on system performance.

In the next section, we will discuss strategies for reducing response time and waiting time in queueing systems.




#### 2.4b Estimating Waiting Time in Queueing Systems

Estimating waiting time in queueing systems is a crucial aspect of queueing theory. It allows us to understand the behavior of the system and make predictions about its future performance. In this section, we will discuss some methods for estimating waiting time in queueing systems.

##### Little's Law

As we have seen in the previous sections, Little's Law provides a relationship between the average number of customers in the system ($L$), the average number of customers arriving at the system ($L_a$), the average number of customers waiting in the queue ($L_q$), and the average number of customers leaving the system ($L_d$). This law can be used to estimate the waiting time in the queue ($L_q$) and hence the response time ($R$).

##### Buzen's Algorithm

Buzen's algorithm is a method for computing the steady state probabilities of the number of customers at each service facility in a closed queueing network. These probabilities can be used to estimate the waiting time in the queue. The algorithm is based on the Gordon-Newell theorem, which provides an expression for the steady state probabilities in terms of the service rates and transition probabilities between service facilities.

##### Fork-Join Queue

In a fork-join queue, a job is split into several sub-tasks, each of which is serviced at a different service facility. The job is only considered complete when all sub-tasks have been serviced. The response time in a fork-join queue can be estimated using the approximation given by Ko and Serfozo. This approximation is based on the assumption that the service times at each service facility are exponentially distributed.

##### Response Time Distribution

The response time distribution gives the probability of a job spending a certain amount of time in the system. This distribution can be used to estimate the waiting time in the queue. The response time distribution can be approximated using various methods, such as the method of moments or the method of least squares.

In the next section, we will discuss some advanced applications of queueing theory, where these methods for estimating waiting time are applied.

## Chapter 3: Queueing Networks:




### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we introduced the concept of queueing theory and its applications in various fields. We discussed the fundamental concepts of queues, such as arrival rate, service rate, and queue length. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the mathematical foundations of queueing theory by exploring distributional laws.

Distributional laws are mathematical tools that allow us to describe the behavior of queues. They provide a way to model the arrival and service patterns of customers in a queue, and to predict the queue length and waiting time. These laws are essential for understanding the behavior of queues and for designing efficient queueing systems.

In this chapter, we will cover the basics of distributional laws, including the Poisson distribution, the exponential distribution, and the Erlang distribution. We will also discuss more advanced topics, such as the M/G/1 queue, the G/M/1 queue, and the M/G/k queue. These topics will provide a solid foundation for understanding more complex queueing systems and their applications.

We will also explore the concept of traffic intensity, which is a key parameter in queueing theory. Traffic intensity is defined as the ratio of the arrival rate to the service rate, and it plays a crucial role in determining the behavior of queues. We will discuss how traffic intensity affects the queue length and waiting time, and how it can be used to optimize queueing systems.

Finally, we will touch upon the concept of queueing networks, which are systems with multiple queues and multiple servers. We will discuss the Erlang-C formula, which is used to calculate the probability of a call being blocked in a queueing network. This formula is widely used in telecommunication networks to determine the capacity of a network.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of distributional laws and their applications in queueing theory. You will be able to model and analyze queueing systems using these laws, and you will be equipped with the necessary knowledge to tackle more advanced topics in queueing theory. So let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of distributional laws in queueing theory.




### Subsection: 3.1a Definition and Properties of Poisson Distribution

The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that is widely used in queueing theory. It is named after the French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson, who first studied it in the early 19th century. The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events that occur in a fixed interval of time or space, given that these events occur independently and at a constant rate.

#### Definition of Poisson Distribution

The Poisson distribution is defined by a single parameter, λ, which represents the average rate of events occurring in the interval. The probability mass function of the Poisson distribution is given by:

$$
P(k;\lambda) = \frac{\lambda^k e^{-\lambda}}{k!}
$$

where k is the number of events that occur in the interval.

#### Properties of Poisson Distribution

The Poisson distribution has several important properties that make it a useful tool in queueing theory. These properties are:

1. The mean of the Poisson distribution is equal to its variance, and both are equal to λ. This property is known as the Poisson distribution being "skew-symmetric".
2. The Poisson distribution is memoryless, meaning that the probability of an event occurring in a given interval is not affected by the number of events that have already occurred.
3. The Poisson distribution is often used to model the number of events that occur in a fixed interval of time or space, given that these events occur independently and at a constant rate. This is known as the "Poisson process".

#### Applications of Poisson Distribution

The Poisson distribution has many applications in queueing theory. Some of these applications include:

1. Modeling the number of arrivals at a service facility, such as a call center or a supermarket.
2. Modeling the number of customers in a queue, given that customers arrive independently and at a constant rate.
3. Modeling the number of events that occur in a fixed interval of time, such as the number of phone calls received by a call center in a given hour.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of the Poisson process in more detail and discuss its applications in queueing theory.




#### 3.1b Application of Poisson Distribution in Queueing Systems

The Poisson distribution is a fundamental tool in queueing theory, and it has numerous applications in queueing systems. In this section, we will explore some of these applications in more detail.

##### Modeling Arrivals in Queueing Systems

One of the most common applications of the Poisson distribution in queueing systems is in modeling arrivals. The arrivals to a queueing system are often modeled as a Poisson process, where the arrivals occur independently and at a constant rate. This assumption is often reasonable in many real-world systems, such as call centers, supermarkets, and network traffic.

The Poisson distribution is particularly useful in this context because it allows us to calculate the probability of a certain number of arrivals occurring in a given interval. This is often crucial in queueing systems, where we need to understand the likelihood of different arrival patterns.

##### Modeling Queue Lengths

Another important application of the Poisson distribution in queueing systems is in modeling queue lengths. The queue length at a service facility is often modeled as a random variable that follows a Poisson distribution. This is because the queue length is determined by the number of arrivals that occur during the service time of the current customer.

The Poisson distribution is a good fit for this application because it allows us to calculate the probability of a certain queue length occurring. This is useful in queueing systems, where we need to understand the likelihood of different queue lengths.

##### Modeling Waiting Times

The Poisson distribution is also used in queueing systems to model waiting times. The waiting time of a customer is often modeled as a random variable that follows an Erlang distribution. The Erlang distribution is a special case of the Poisson distribution, and it is often used to model waiting times in queueing systems.

The Poisson distribution is a good fit for this application because it allows us to calculate the probability of a certain waiting time occurring. This is useful in queueing systems, where we need to understand the likelihood of different waiting times.

In conclusion, the Poisson distribution is a powerful tool in queueing theory, and it has numerous applications in queueing systems. Its ability to model arrivals, queue lengths, and waiting times makes it an essential tool for understanding and analyzing queueing systems.

#### 3.1c Solving for Unknown Parameters in Poisson Distribution

The Poisson distribution is a powerful tool in queueing theory, but it is often used with unknown parameters. In this section, we will explore how to solve for these unknown parameters in the context of queueing systems.

##### Solving for the Arrival Rate

The arrival rate, denoted by $\lambda$, is a key parameter in the Poisson distribution. It represents the average rate at which customers arrive at a service facility. In queueing systems, this parameter is often unknown and needs to be estimated from the data.

One common method for estimating the arrival rate is the method of moments. This method involves equating the moments of the observed data with the moments of the Poisson distribution. The arrival rate can then be solved for by setting the equations equal and solving for $\lambda$.

Another method for estimating the arrival rate is the maximum likelihood estimation. This method involves maximizing the likelihood function, which is defined as the probability of the observed data given the arrival rate. The arrival rate can then be solved for by setting the derivative of the likelihood function equal to zero and solving for $\lambda$.

##### Solving for the Service Rate

The service rate, denoted by $\mu$, is another key parameter in the Poisson distribution. It represents the average rate at which customers are served at a service facility. In queueing systems, this parameter is often unknown and needs to be estimated from the data.

Similar to the arrival rate, the service rate can be estimated using the method of moments or the maximum likelihood estimation. However, in the case of the service rate, we also need to consider the service time distribution. This is because the service rate is affected by the service time distribution, and the Poisson distribution assumes that the service time follows an exponential distribution.

##### Solving for the Queue Length

The queue length, denoted by $L$, is a third key parameter in the Poisson distribution. It represents the average number of customers in the queue at a service facility. In queueing systems, this parameter is often unknown and needs to be estimated from the data.

The queue length can be estimated using the Little's Law, which states that the queue length is equal to the product of the arrival rate and the average time a customer spends in the system. This law can be used to solve for the queue length, given the arrival rate and the average time a customer spends in the system.

In conclusion, the Poisson distribution is a powerful tool in queueing theory, but it is often used with unknown parameters. By using methods such as the method of moments, maximum likelihood estimation, and Little's Law, we can estimate these parameters and apply the Poisson distribution in queueing systems.




#### 3.2a Definition and Properties of Exponential Distribution

The exponential distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is often used in queueing theory. It is named as such because the probability density function of the exponential distribution is always positive and exponential in nature. The exponential distribution is commonly used to model the time between events in a Poisson process, where events occur independently and at a constant rate.

The exponential distribution is defined by a single parameter, $\beta$, which represents the rate parameter. The probability density function of the exponential distribution is given by:

$$
f(x;\beta) = \beta e^{-\beta x}
$$

where $x$ is the time between events.

The exponential distribution has several important properties that make it a useful tool in queueing theory. These properties include:

1. The mean of the exponential distribution is equal to $1/\beta$. This means that the average time between events is inversely proportional to the rate parameter.

2. The variance of the exponential distribution is equal to $1/\beta^2$. This means that the variability of the time between events is also inversely proportional to the rate parameter.

3. The exponential distribution is memoryless. This means that the probability of an event occurring in a given interval is not affected by the time that has passed since the last event. This property is particularly useful in queueing systems, where we often need to model systems where the arrival rate is constant over time.

4. The exponential distribution is often used to approximate the normal distribution when the sample size is large. This is known as the central limit theorem.

5. The exponential distribution is often used to model the service time in queueing systems. This is because the service time is often assumed to be exponentially distributed, meaning that the probability of a service time being longer than a certain value is exponentially decreasing.

In the next section, we will explore some applications of the exponential distribution in queueing systems.

#### 3.2b Application of Exponential Distribution in Queueing Systems

The exponential distribution is a fundamental tool in queueing theory, and it is widely used in the modeling and analysis of queueing systems. In this section, we will explore some of the applications of the exponential distribution in queueing systems.

##### Modeling Service Times

One of the most common applications of the exponential distribution in queueing systems is in modeling service times. The service time is the time that a customer spends being served by a server. In many queueing systems, the service time is assumed to be exponentially distributed. This assumption is based on the idea that the service time is independent of the previous service times, and the probability of a service time being longer than a certain value is exponentially decreasing.

The exponential distribution is a good fit for modeling service times because it allows us to calculate the probability of a service time being longer than a certain value. This is often crucial in queueing systems, where we need to understand the likelihood of long service times.

##### Modeling Queue Lengths

Another important application of the exponential distribution in queueing systems is in modeling queue lengths. The queue length is the number of customers waiting in a queue. In many queueing systems, the queue length is assumed to be exponentially distributed. This assumption is based on the idea that the queue length is independent of the previous queue lengths, and the probability of a queue length being larger than a certain value is exponentially decreasing.

The exponential distribution is a good fit for modeling queue lengths because it allows us to calculate the probability of a queue length being larger than a certain value. This is often crucial in queueing systems, where we need to understand the likelihood of long queues.

##### Modeling Arrival Processes

The exponential distribution is also used in queueing systems to model arrival processes. The arrival process is the process by which customers arrive at a queueing system. In many queueing systems, the arrival process is assumed to be a Poisson process, where the arrivals occur independently and at a constant rate. The exponential distribution is used to model the time between arrivals in a Poisson process.

The exponential distribution is a good fit for modeling arrival processes because it allows us to calculate the probability of a certain number of arrivals occurring in a given interval. This is often crucial in queueing systems, where we need to understand the likelihood of different arrival patterns.

In the next section, we will explore some advanced applications of the exponential distribution in queueing systems.

#### 3.2c Case Studies of Exponential Distribution

In this section, we will delve into some real-world case studies that illustrate the application of the exponential distribution in queueing systems. These case studies will provide a deeper understanding of the concepts discussed in the previous sections.

##### Case Study 1: Telecommunication Network

Consider a telecommunication network where customers make calls to a call center. The call center has a limited number of agents to handle the calls. The service time for each call is exponentially distributed with a mean of 2 minutes. The arrival process to the call center is a Poisson process with a rate of 10 calls per hour.

Using the exponential distribution, we can calculate the probability of a service time being longer than 3 minutes. This is given by the formula:

$$
P(X > 3) = e^{-3\beta}
$$

where $X$ is the service time and $\beta$ is the rate parameter. Substituting the mean of the service time, we get:

$$
P(X > 3) = e^{-3 \times \frac{1}{2}} = 0.27
$$

This means that there is a 27% chance that a service time will be longer than 3 minutes.

##### Case Study 2: Supermarket Queue

Consider a supermarket queue where customers arrive to check out their groceries. The service time for each customer is exponentially distributed with a mean of 1 minute. The arrival process to the queue is a Poisson process with a rate of 10 customers per hour.

Using the exponential distribution, we can calculate the probability of a queue length being larger than 5 customers. This is given by the formula:

$$
P(Q > 5) = e^{-5\beta}
$$

where $Q$ is the queue length and $\beta$ is the rate parameter. Substituting the mean of the service time, we get:

$$
P(Q > 5) = e^{-5 \times \frac{1}{1}} = 0.03
$$

This means that there is a 3% chance that the queue length will be larger than 5 customers.

##### Case Study 3: Network Traffic

Consider a network traffic model where packets arrive at a router. The service time for each packet is exponentially distributed with a mean of 0.1 milliseconds. The arrival process to the router is a Poisson process with a rate of 100 packets per second.

Using the exponential distribution, we can calculate the probability of a service time being longer than 0.2 milliseconds. This is given by the formula:

$$
P(X > 0.2) = e^{-0.2\beta}
$$

where $X$ is the service time and $\beta$ is the rate parameter. Substituting the mean of the service time, we get:

$$
P(X > 0.2) = e^{-0.2 \times \frac{1}{0.1}} = 0.81
$$

This means that there is an 81% chance that a service time will be longer than 0.2 milliseconds.

These case studies illustrate the versatility of the exponential distribution in modeling various aspects of queueing systems. The exponential distribution is a powerful tool that allows us to calculate probabilities of different events occurring in a queueing system.




#### 3.2b Application of Exponential Distribution in Queueing Systems

The exponential distribution is a fundamental tool in queueing theory, and it is widely used in the analysis of queueing systems. In this section, we will explore some of the key applications of the exponential distribution in queueing systems.

##### 3.2b.1 Modeling Service Times

As mentioned in the previous section, the exponential distribution is often used to model the service time in queueing systems. This is because the service time is often assumed to be exponentially distributed, meaning that the probability of a service time being longer than a certain value is exponentially decreasing. This assumption is particularly useful in systems where the service times are not known or are highly variable.

The exponential distribution is also used to model the service times in the M/G/1 queue, which is a single-server queueing system with exponentially distributed arrival times and general service times. The service time distribution in this system is often assumed to be exponential, and the queue discipline is typically first-come-first-served (FCFS).

##### 3.2b.2 Modeling Waiting Times

The exponential distribution is also used to model the waiting times in queueing systems. In particular, it is used to model the waiting times in the M/G/1 queue. The waiting time in this system is defined as the time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served.

The exponential distribution is a useful tool for modeling waiting times because it allows us to calculate the probability of a customer waiting for more than a certain amount of time. This is particularly important in queueing systems where customers may have time constraints or where we want to ensure that customers are not waiting for too long.

##### 3.2b.3 Modeling Traffic Load

The exponential distribution is also used to model the traffic load in queueing systems. The traffic load is defined as the average number of customers in the system, and it is often used to measure the utilization of a queueing system.

The exponential distribution is useful for modeling the traffic load because it allows us to calculate the probability of the system being in a particular state. This is particularly important in queueing systems where we want to ensure that the system is not overloaded and that customers are not experiencing excessive waiting times.

In conclusion, the exponential distribution is a powerful tool in queueing theory, and it is widely used in the analysis of queueing systems. Its applications include modeling service times, waiting times, and traffic load, and it is particularly useful in systems where the arrival and service times are not known or are highly variable. 





#### 3.3a Definition and Properties of Erlang Distribution

The Erlang distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is commonly used in queueing theory. It is named after the Danish mathematician Agner Krarup Erlang, who first used it to model telephone call arrival patterns. The Erlang distribution is often used to model the time between events in a Poisson process with a constant rate.

The Erlang distribution is defined by two parameters, $k$ and $\lambda$, where $k$ is the shape parameter and $\lambda$ is the rate parameter. The probability density function of the Erlang distribution is given by:

$$
f(x;k,\lambda) = \frac{\lambda^k x^{k-1} e^{-\lambda x}}{(k-1)!}
$$

where $x$ is the time between events.

The Erlang distribution has several important properties that make it a useful tool in queueing theory. These properties are:

1. The mean of the Erlang distribution is equal to $k/\lambda$. This means that the average time between events is inversely proportional to the rate parameter $\lambda$.

2. The variance of the Erlang distribution is equal to $k/\lambda^2$. This means that the variability of the time between events is also inversely proportional to $\lambda$.

3. The Erlang distribution is memoryless. This means that the probability of an event occurring in a given interval is not affected by the time that has passed since the last event. This property is particularly useful in queueing systems, where we often assume that the arrival rate is constant over time.

4. The Erlang distribution is often used to model the service time in queueing systems. This is because the service time is often assumed to be exponentially distributed, and the Erlang distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution, which is the probability distribution of the sum of independent exponential random variables.

5. The Erlang distribution is also used to model the waiting times in queueing systems. This is because the waiting time is often assumed to be exponentially distributed, and the Erlang distribution is a special case of the Pareto distribution, which is the probability distribution of the waiting time in a single-server queueing system with exponentially distributed service times.

In the next section, we will explore some of the key applications of the Erlang distribution in queueing systems.

#### 3.3b Application of Erlang Distribution in Queueing Systems

The Erlang distribution is a powerful tool in queueing theory, and it has a wide range of applications in queueing systems. In this section, we will explore some of these applications in more detail.

##### 3.3b.1 Modeling Service Times

As mentioned in the previous section, the Erlang distribution is often used to model the service time in queueing systems. This is because the service time is often assumed to be exponentially distributed, and the Erlang distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution, which is the probability distribution of the sum of independent exponential random variables.

In a queueing system, the service time is the time a customer spends being served. It is a critical parameter in the system, as it directly affects the waiting time and the overall efficiency of the system. By modeling the service time with the Erlang distribution, we can calculate the probability of a service time being longer than a certain value, which is useful in systems where we want to ensure that customers are not waiting for too long.

##### 3.3b.2 Modeling Waiting Times

The Erlang distribution is also used to model the waiting time in queueing systems. This is because the waiting time is often assumed to be exponentially distributed, and the Erlang distribution is a special case of the Pareto distribution, which is the probability distribution of the waiting time in a single-server queueing system with exponentially distributed service times.

The waiting time is the time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. It is a key metric in queueing systems, as it directly affects the customer experience and the overall efficiency of the system. By modeling the waiting time with the Erlang distribution, we can calculate the probability of a waiting time being longer than a certain value, which is useful in systems where we want to ensure that customers are not waiting for too long.

##### 3.3b.3 Modeling Traffic Load

The Erlang distribution is also used to model the traffic load in queueing systems. The traffic load is defined as the average number of customers in the system. It is a critical parameter in the system, as it directly affects the waiting time and the overall efficiency of the system.

The traffic load is often assumed to be exponentially distributed, and the Erlang distribution is a special case of the Erlang-C distribution, which is the probability distribution of the traffic load in a queueing system with exponentially distributed service times. By modeling the traffic load with the Erlang distribution, we can calculate the probability of the traffic load being higher than a certain value, which is useful in systems where we want to ensure that the system is not overloaded.

In conclusion, the Erlang distribution is a versatile tool in queueing theory, with applications in modeling service times, waiting times, and traffic load. Its ability to capture the exponential distribution of these parameters makes it a valuable tool in the analysis and design of queueing systems.

#### 3.3c Erlang Distribution in Real World Scenarios

The Erlang distribution, named after the Danish mathematician Agner Krarup Erlang, has found widespread application in various real-world scenarios. This section will explore some of these applications, demonstrating the versatility and utility of the Erlang distribution in queueing theory.

##### 3.3c.1 Telecommunication Networks

One of the most common applications of the Erlang distribution is in telecommunication networks. The Erlang distribution is used to model the time between events, such as phone calls or data transmissions, in a Poisson process with a constant rate. This is particularly useful in telecommunication networks, where the number of events (e.g., phone calls) can be modeled as a Poisson process.

The Erlang distribution is also used to model the service time in telecommunication networks. This is because the service time, i.e., the time a customer spends being served, is often assumed to be exponentially distributed. This assumption is particularly useful in telecommunication networks, where the service time can be modeled as the time it takes to process a phone call or a data transmission.

##### 3.3c.2 Queueing Systems

The Erlang distribution is also widely used in queueing systems. As mentioned in the previous sections, the Erlang distribution is used to model the service time and the waiting time in queueing systems. This is because the service time and the waiting time are often assumed to be exponentially distributed.

In queueing systems, the Erlang distribution is particularly useful in systems where we want to ensure that customers are not waiting for too long. By modeling the waiting time with the Erlang distribution, we can calculate the probability of a waiting time being longer than a certain value. This information can be used to optimize the system and reduce the waiting time for customers.

##### 3.3c.3 Traffic Load Modeling

The Erlang distribution is also used in traffic load modeling. The traffic load is defined as the average number of customers in the system. In queueing systems, the traffic load is often assumed to be exponentially distributed. This assumption is particularly useful in systems where we want to ensure that the system is not overloaded.

By modeling the traffic load with the Erlang distribution, we can calculate the probability of the traffic load being higher than a certain value. This information can be used to optimize the system and ensure that the system is not overloaded.

In conclusion, the Erlang distribution is a powerful tool in queueing theory, with applications in various real-world scenarios. Its ability to model the time between events, the service time, the waiting time, and the traffic load makes it a versatile and useful distribution in queueing theory.




#### 3.3b Application of Erlang Distribution in Queueing Systems

The Erlang distribution has been widely used in queueing systems due to its ability to model the time between events in a Poisson process with a constant rate. This makes it particularly useful in systems where events occur independently with some average rate, such as call centers, ticket-sales windows, and toilets on an airplane.

One of the key applications of the Erlang distribution in queueing systems is in determining the probability of packet loss or delay. This is achieved through the Erlang-B and Erlang-C formulae, which are still in everyday use for traffic modeling. The Erlang-B formula assumes that blocked calls are aborted, while the Erlang-C formula assumes that blocked calls are queued until served. These formulae can be used to determine the probability of packet loss or delay, according to various assumptions made about the system.

The Erlang distribution has also been used in business economics for describing interpurchase times. It has been suggested as a good approximation of cell cycle time distribution, as result of multi-stage models. Furthermore, the age distribution of cancer incidence often follows the Erlang distribution, with the shape and scale parameters predicting the number of driver events and the time interval between them, respectively.

In conclusion, the Erlang distribution is a powerful tool in queueing theory, with a wide range of applications in various fields. Its ability to model the time between events in a Poisson process with a constant rate makes it particularly useful in queueing systems, where it can be used to determine the probability of packet loss or delay, among other applications.

#### 3.3c Solving for Unknown Parameters in Erlang Distribution

In the previous section, we discussed the application of Erlang distribution in queueing systems. Now, let's delve into the process of solving for unknown parameters in Erlang distribution. 

The Erlang distribution is defined by two parameters, $k$ and $\lambda$, where $k$ is the shape parameter and $\lambda$ is the rate parameter. The probability density function of the Erlang distribution is given by:

$$
f(x;k,\lambda) = \frac{\lambda^k x^{k-1} e^{-\lambda x}}{(k-1)!}
$$

where $x$ is the time between events.

To solve for unknown parameters in Erlang distribution, we can use the method of moments or the method of maximum likelihood.

##### Method of Moments

The method of moments is a graphical method used to estimate the parameters of a probability distribution. In the case of Erlang distribution, we can use the method of moments to estimate the parameters $k$ and $\lambda$ by equating the moments of the Erlang distribution with the observed moments.

The first moment of the Erlang distribution is given by:

$$
\mu = \frac{k}{\lambda}
$$

The second moment of the Erlang distribution is given by:

$$
\mu_2 = \frac{k(k+1)}{\lambda^2}
$$

If we have observed data with first moment $\mu_1$ and second moment $\mu_2$, we can equate these moments with the moments of the Erlang distribution to solve for $k$ and $\lambda$:

$$
\mu_1 = \frac{k}{\lambda}
$$

$$
\mu_2 = \frac{k(k+1)}{\lambda^2}
$$

Solving these equations simultaneously, we can obtain the estimates for $k$ and $\lambda$.

##### Method of Maximum Likelihood

The method of maximum likelihood is a numerical method used to estimate the parameters of a probability distribution. In the case of Erlang distribution, we can use the method of maximum likelihood to estimate the parameters $k$ and $\lambda$ by maximizing the likelihood function.

The likelihood function of the Erlang distribution is given by:

$$
L(k,\lambda) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\lambda^k x_i^{k-1} e^{-\lambda x_i}}{(k-1)!}
$$

where $x_i$ are the observed times between events.

To estimate the parameters $k$ and $\lambda$, we can use numerical methods such as the Newton-Raphson method or the BFGS algorithm to maximize the likelihood function.

In conclusion, solving for unknown parameters in Erlang distribution is a crucial step in queueing theory. The method of moments and the method of maximum likelihood are two common methods used to estimate these parameters. The choice of method depends on the specific requirements of the problem and the availability of computational resources.




#### 3.4a Definition and Properties of Hyperexponential Distribution

The hyperexponential distribution is a continuous probability distribution that is used to model systems where events occur independently with varying rates. It is named the "hyper"exponential distribution since its coefficient of variation is greater than that of the exponential distribution, whose coefficient of variation is 1, and the hypoexponential distribution, which has a coefficient of variation smaller than one.

The probability density function of the hyperexponential distribution is given by:

$$
f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \lambda_i e^{-\lambda_i x}
$$

where each $Y_i$ is an exponentially distributed random variable with rate parameter $\lambda_i$, and $p_i$ is the probability that $X$ will take on the form of the exponential distribution with rate $\lambda_i$. The $p_i$ values are non-negative and sum to 1.

The hyperexponential distribution is an example of a mixture density, meaning it is a weighted sum of exponential distributions. This makes it particularly useful in systems where events occur independently with varying rates.

#### Properties of Hyperexponential Distribution

1. **Expected Value:** The expected value of a hyperexponential random variable can be shown as:

$$
E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{p_i}{\lambda_i}
$$

2. **Variance:** The variance of a hyperexponential random variable can be derived from the expected value:

$$
Var(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{p_i}{\lambda_i^2} - \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{p_i}{\lambda_i}\right)^2
$$

3. **Coefficient of Variation:** The coefficient of variation is greater than 1, indicating that the standard deviation exceeds the mean in general (except for the degenerate case of all the $\lambda$s being equal).

4. **Moment-Generating Function:** The moment-generating function of a hyperexponential distribution is given by:

$$
M(t) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \frac{\lambda_i}{\lambda_i - t}
$$

5. **Fitting:** A given probability distribution can be approximated by a hyperexponential distribution by fitting recursively to different time scales using Prony's method. This allows for the approximation of heavy-tailed distributions.

In the next section, we will explore the application of hyperexponential distribution in queueing systems.

#### 3.4b Application of Hyperexponential Distribution in Queueing Systems

The hyperexponential distribution is a powerful tool in queueing theory, particularly in systems where events occur independently with varying rates. This makes it particularly useful in queueing systems, where the arrival and service rates can vary significantly.

One of the key applications of the hyperexponential distribution in queueing systems is in modeling the response time distribution. The response time is the time a customer spends in the system, from arrival until departure. In a queueing system, the response time can be modeled as a random variable, and the distribution of this random variable can be used to analyze the performance of the system.

The hyperexponential distribution can be used to model the response time distribution in a queueing system, particularly when the arrival and service rates vary significantly. This is because the hyperexponential distribution is a weighted sum of exponential distributions, each with its own arrival and service rates. This allows for a more accurate representation of the system's behavior, as it takes into account the varying rates.

Another important application of the hyperexponential distribution in queueing systems is in modeling the queue length distribution. The queue length is the number of customers in the queue. In a queueing system, the queue length can also be modeled as a random variable, and the distribution of this random variable can be used to analyze the system's performance.

The hyperexponential distribution can be used to model the queue length distribution in a queueing system, particularly when the arrival and service rates vary significantly. This is because the hyperexponential distribution can capture the variability in the arrival and service rates, which can significantly affect the queue length.

In conclusion, the hyperexponential distribution is a powerful tool in queueing theory, particularly in systems where events occur independently with varying rates. Its ability to model the response time and queue length distributions makes it a valuable tool in analyzing the performance of queueing systems.

#### 3.4c Solving for Unknown Parameters in Hyperexponential Distribution

In the previous section, we discussed the application of the hyperexponential distribution in queueing systems. Now, let's delve into the process of solving for unknown parameters in the hyperexponential distribution.

The hyperexponential distribution is a weighted sum of exponential distributions, each with its own arrival and service rates. The parameters of these exponential distributions are what we are interested in solving for. 

Let's denote the arrival rate for the $i$th exponential distribution as $\lambda_i$ and the service rate as $\mu_i$. The probability of a customer being served by the $i$th exponential distribution is denoted as $p_i$. 

The hyperexponential distribution can be written as:

$$
f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i \lambda_i e^{-\lambda_i x}
$$

where $x$ is the time a customer spends in the system.

To solve for the unknown parameters, we can use the method of moments. This involves equating the moments of the hyperexponential distribution with the moments of the observed data. 

The first moment of the hyperexponential distribution is given by:

$$
E(X) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{p_i}{\lambda_i}
$$

The second moment of the hyperexponential distribution is given by:

$$
E(X^2) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{p_i}{\lambda_i^2}
$$

By equating these moments with the observed moments, we can solve for the unknown parameters. 

For example, if we have observed data with a mean response time of $\bar{X}$ and a variance of $Var(X)$, we can set the first and second moments equal to these observed values and solve for the parameters.

This method can be extended to solve for more than two parameters. For example, if we have three exponential distributions with arrival rates $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$, and $\lambda_3$, and service rates $\mu_1$, $\mu_2$, and $\mu_3$, we can use the method of moments to solve for these six unknown parameters.

In the next section, we will discuss another method for solving for unknown parameters in the hyperexponential distribution: the method of least squares.

#### 3.5a Definition and Properties of General Distribution

The general distribution is a fundamental concept in queueing theory, providing a framework for modeling and analyzing a wide range of queueing systems. It is a probability distribution that describes the time between events in a queueing system, where each event is served by a different server with varying service rates.

##### Definition

The general distribution is defined by a set of parameters, $a$ and $b$, and a set of weights, $c_{ij}$, where $i$ represents the server and $j$ represents the event. The parameter $a$ represents the minimum time between events, and $b$ represents the maximum time between events. The weights $c_{ij}$ represent the probability of event $j$ being served by server $i$.

The general distribution is given by the following equation:

$$
f(y) = \frac{\prod_{j=1}^{J} \frac{1}{c_{jj}} \phi_j\Big( \frac{y - \sum_{k=1}^{k<j} c_{jk}\eta_k }{c_{jj}}\Big)}{ \prod_{j=1}^J \Big(\Phi_j \Big( \frac{b - \sum_{k=1}^{k<j} c_{jk}\eta_k}{c_{jj}} \Big) - \Phi\Big( \frac{a - \sum_{k=1}^{k<j} c_{jk}\eta_k}{c_{jj}}\Big) \Big)}
$$

where $\phi_j$ is the standard normal pdf for choice $j$, and $\Phi_j$ is the standard normal cdf for choice $j$.

##### Properties

The general distribution has several important properties that make it a powerful tool in queueing theory. These properties include:

1. The general distribution is a continuous distribution, meaning that the time between events can take on any value within the interval $[a, b]$.
2. The general distribution is a multivariate distribution, meaning that it describes the joint behavior of multiple events.
3. The general distribution is a flexible distribution, meaning that it can be used to model a wide range of queueing systems with varying service rates.
4. The general distribution is a tractable distribution, meaning that it can be easily calculated and analyzed using standard mathematical techniques.

In the next section, we will explore the application of the general distribution in queueing systems.

#### 3.5b Application of General Distribution in Queueing Systems

The general distribution is a powerful tool in queueing theory, providing a flexible and tractable framework for modeling and analyzing queueing systems. In this section, we will explore some of the applications of the general distribution in queueing systems.

##### Call Center Model

One of the most common applications of the general distribution is in call center modeling. In a call center, customers arrive and are served by different agents with varying service rates. The general distribution can be used to model the time between arrivals and the service time for each customer.

Consider a call center with $N$ agents, each with a service rate $\mu_i$. The arrival rate of customers is $\lambda$, and the service time for each customer is exponentially distributed with mean $1/\mu_i$. The general distribution can be used to model the time between arrivals and the service time for each customer.

The probability density function of the general distribution can be used to calculate the probability of a customer waiting in the queue, the average number of customers in the queue, and the average waiting time in the queue. These metrics are crucial for evaluating the performance of the call center and for making decisions about resource allocation.

##### Network Traffic Model

The general distribution can also be used to model network traffic. In a network, packets are transmitted and received by different nodes with varying transmission rates. The general distribution can be used to model the time between packet transmissions and the transmission time for each packet.

Consider a network with $N$ nodes, each with a transmission rate $\mu_i$. The arrival rate of packets is $\lambda$, and the transmission time for each packet is exponentially distributed with mean $1/\mu_i$. The general distribution can be used to model the time between packet transmissions and the transmission time for each packet.

The probability density function of the general distribution can be used to calculate the probability of a packet waiting in the queue, the average number of packets in the queue, and the average waiting time in the queue. These metrics are crucial for evaluating the performance of the network and for making decisions about resource allocation.

##### Conclusion

In conclusion, the general distribution is a versatile and powerful tool in queueing theory. It can be used to model a wide range of queueing systems, from call centers to networks, and can provide valuable insights into the performance of these systems. The properties of the general distribution, such as its flexibility and tractability, make it a valuable tool for queueing theorists and practitioners alike.

#### 3.5c Challenges in Using General Distribution

While the general distribution is a powerful tool in queueing theory, it also presents several challenges that must be addressed in order to effectively use it. These challenges are primarily related to the complexity of the distribution and the assumptions made in its application.

##### Complexity of the Distribution

The general distribution is a multivariate distribution that describes the joint behavior of multiple events. This complexity can make it difficult to apply the distribution in practice. For example, in the call center model, the general distribution requires knowledge of the service rates of each agent, which may not always be readily available. Similarly, in the network traffic model, the general distribution requires knowledge of the transmission rates of each node, which can be difficult to obtain in large and complex networks.

##### Assumptions Made in Application

The general distribution is often applied under certain assumptions, such as the assumption that the service time for each customer or packet is exponentially distributed. However, these assumptions may not always hold in real-world systems. For example, in a call center, the service time for customers may not always be exponentially distributed due to factors such as agent expertise and call complexity. Similarly, in a network, the transmission time for packets may not always be exponentially distributed due to factors such as network congestion and packet size.

##### Limitations of the Distribution

The general distribution is a flexible distribution that can be used to model a wide range of queueing systems. However, this flexibility also means that the distribution may not always provide accurate predictions for specific systems. For example, the general distribution assumes that the service rates of agents or nodes are constant over time, which may not always be the case in real-world systems. Similarly, the distribution assumes that the arrival rate of customers or packets is constant, which may not always hold in systems with varying levels of activity.

Despite these challenges, the general distribution remains a valuable tool in queueing theory. By understanding and addressing these challenges, we can better apply the distribution to model and analyze queueing systems.

## Chapter: Advanced Techniques in Queueing Theory

### Introduction

Queueing theory is a fundamental discipline in the field of operations research, with wide-ranging applications in various fields such as telecommunications, computer science, and industrial engineering. This chapter, "Advanced Techniques in Queueing Theory," delves into the more complex and intricate aspects of queueing theory, building upon the foundational concepts introduced in the previous chapters.

The chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of advanced queueing techniques, including but not limited to, the M/G/k, M/M/k, and M/G/1 models. These models are essential in understanding the behavior of queueing systems under different conditions. The M/G/k model, for instance, is used to analyze queueing systems with multiple servers and general service time distributions. The M/M/k model, on the other hand, is used for systems with multiple servers and exponential service time distributions. Lastly, the M/G/1 model is used for single-server queueing systems with general service time distributions.

In addition to these models, the chapter also explores the concept of queueing networks, which are systems of interconnected queues. Queueing networks are particularly useful in modeling complex systems such as call centers, computer systems, and communication networks.

Throughout the chapter, we will use mathematical notation to express these concepts. For example, the arrival rate of customers to a queueing system is denoted by $\lambda$, and the service rate by $\mu$. The probability of an event $A$ occurring is denoted by $P(A)$.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of these advanced queueing techniques and be able to apply them to analyze and optimize queueing systems in various real-world scenarios.




#### 3.5b Application of General Distribution in Queueing Systems

The general distribution is a powerful tool in queueing theory, providing a flexible and tractable framework for modeling and analyzing a wide range of queueing systems. In this section, we will explore some of the applications of the general distribution in queueing systems.

##### Fork-Join Queue Networks

One of the key applications of the general distribution is in the analysis of fork-join queue networks. A fork-join queue network is a type of queueing system where a job is split into multiple sub-tasks, which are serviced in parallel. The job can only proceed to the next stage once all the sub-tasks have been completed.

The general distribution can be used to model the response time distribution in a fork-join queue network. This is done by considering the general distribution as a special case of the split-merge model, where the service time for each sub-task is modeled as a general distribution. The response time distribution can then be calculated using the approximate formula provided by Buzen's algorithm.

##### Split-Merge Model

The split-merge model is another important application of the general distribution. In this model, a job is split into multiple sub-tasks, which are serviced in parallel. Once all the sub-tasks have been completed, the job rejoins and proceeds to the next stage.

The general distribution can be used to model the response time distribution in a split-merge queue. This is done by considering the general distribution as a special case of the split-merge model, where the service time for each sub-task is modeled as a general distribution. The response time distribution can then be calculated using the results provided by Fiorini and Lipsky.

##### Other Applications

The general distribution has many other applications in queueing theory. For example, it can be used to model the response time distribution in a network of fork-join queues joined in series, as mentioned earlier. It can also be used to model the response time distribution in a network of service facilities, as described in Buzen's algorithm.

In addition, the general distribution can be used to model the response time distribution in a variety of other queueing systems, including networks of service facilities, networks of fork-join queues, and networks of split-merge queues. Its flexibility and tractability make it a valuable tool for analyzing a wide range of queueing systems.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the properties of the general distribution and explore how these properties contribute to its usefulness in queueing theory.

#### 3.5c Case Studies of General Distribution in Queueing Systems

In this section, we will delve into some real-world case studies that illustrate the application of the general distribution in queueing systems. These case studies will provide a practical perspective on the concepts discussed in the previous sections.

##### Case Study 1: Fork-Join Queue Network in a Manufacturing Company

Consider a manufacturing company that uses a fork-join queue network to process orders. The company splits each order into multiple sub-tasks, which are serviced in parallel. The order can only proceed to the next stage once all the sub-tasks have been completed.

The general distribution can be used to model the response time distribution in this queueing system. The service time for each sub-task is modeled as a general distribution, and the response time distribution is calculated using the approximate formula provided by Buzen's algorithm. This allows the company to estimate the average response time for orders, which is a critical metric for customer satisfaction.

##### Case Study 2: Split-Merge Model in a Call Center

A call center can be modeled as a split-merge queue, where each call is split into multiple sub-tasks (e.g., answering the call, handling the customer's query, and closing the call) that are serviced in parallel. Once all the sub-tasks have been completed, the call rejoins and proceeds to the next stage.

The general distribution can be used to model the response time distribution in this queueing system. The service time for each sub-task is modeled as a general distribution, and the response time distribution is calculated using the results provided by Fiorini and Lipsky. This allows the call center to estimate the average response time for calls, which is a critical metric for customer satisfaction.

##### Case Study 3: Network of Service Facilities in a Hospital

A hospital can be modeled as a network of service facilities, where each service facility (e.g., emergency room, radiology department, etc.) serves a different type of patient. The general distribution can be used to model the response time distribution in this queueing system. The service time for each patient at each service facility is modeled as a general distribution, and the response time distribution is calculated using Buzen's algorithm. This allows the hospital to estimate the average response time for patients, which is a critical metric for patient care.

These case studies illustrate the versatility of the general distribution in queueing theory. By modeling the service time for each event as a general distribution, we can calculate the response time distribution for a wide range of queueing systems, from manufacturing companies to call centers to hospitals. This allows us to estimate critical metrics for these systems, such as the average response time for orders, calls, or patients.

## Chapter: Chapter 4: Little’s Law

### Introduction

In the realm of queueing theory, Little's Law holds a pivotal role. Named after John D. Little, a renowned mathematician and computer scientist, this law is a fundamental principle that describes the relationship between the average queue length, the average waiting time, and the average arrival rate in a queueing system. 

Little's Law is a cornerstone of queueing theory, providing a mathematical foundation for understanding and analyzing queueing systems. It is a simple yet powerful law that has wide-ranging applications in various fields, including telecommunications, computer science, and operations research. 

In this chapter, we will delve into the intricacies of Little's Law, exploring its derivation, implications, and applications. We will also discuss the assumptions and limitations of this law, and how it can be extended to more complex queueing systems. 

We will begin by introducing the basic concepts of Little's Law, including the queue length, waiting time, and arrival rate. We will then proceed to derive the law, using the principles of conservation of flow and Little's formula.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the fundamental distributional laws that form the basis of queueing theory. These laws have been used to model and analyze various real-world systems, providing valuable insights into the behavior of queues. By understanding these laws, we can make predictions about the performance of a queueing system and make informed decisions about its design and operation.

We began by discussing the Poisson distribution, which is used to model the arrival process in a queueing system. We learned that the Poisson distribution is memoryless, meaning that the probability of an event occurring in a given interval is not affected by the number of events that have occurred in the past. This property is crucial in queueing theory, as it allows us to make predictions about the arrival process without having to consider the entire history of the system.

Next, we explored the exponential distribution, which is used to model the service time in a queueing system. We learned that the exponential distribution is also memoryless, but unlike the Poisson distribution, it is continuous rather than discrete. This distribution is often used in conjunction with the Poisson distribution to model the arrival and service processes in a queueing system.

We then moved on to discuss the Erlang distribution, which is used to model the waiting time in a queueing system. We learned that the Erlang distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution, and it is often used to model systems with a fixed number of servers and a constant arrival rate. We also explored the Erlang-C formula, which is used to calculate the probability of waiting in a queueing system.

Finally, we discussed the central limit theorem, which is used to approximate the behavior of a queueing system with a large number of servers. We learned that the central limit theorem states that the sum of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables will be approximately normally distributed. This theorem is useful in queueing theory, as it allows us to make predictions about the behavior of a queueing system with a large number of servers.

In conclusion, the distributional laws discussed in this chapter are essential tools in queueing theory.

## Chapter 4: Queueing Networks:




### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamentals of queueing theory, including the basic concepts and models. We have also delved into the applications of queueing theory in various fields, such as telecommunication networks, computer systems, and manufacturing systems. In this chapter, we will build upon our understanding of queueing theory by introducing the concept of conservation laws.

Conservation laws are fundamental principles in queueing theory that govern the behavior of queues. These laws are based on the concept of conservation of flow, which states that the total flow into a system must be equal to the total flow out of the system. In queueing theory, this principle is applied to the arrival and departure rates of customers in a queue.

We will begin this chapter by discussing Little's Law, which is a fundamental conservation law in queueing theory. Little's Law states that the average number of customers in a queue is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. This law is essential in understanding the behavior of queues and is used in various applications, such as traffic engineering and call center management.

Next, we will explore the concept of conservation of flow in queueing networks. We will discuss how the arrival and departure rates of customers are affected by the number of queues and the routing policies in a network. We will also introduce the concept of traffic models, which are used to analyze the behavior of queueing networks.

Finally, we will discuss the concept of conservation of flow in multiserver queues. We will explore how the arrival and departure rates of customers are affected by the number of servers and the service time distribution in a queue. We will also introduce the concept of Erlang's loss formula, which is used to calculate the probability of a customer being lost in a queue.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of conservation laws in queueing theory and how they are applied in various queueing models. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for the advanced applications of queueing theory that will be covered in the following chapters. So let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of conservation laws in queueing theory.




### Subsection: 4.1a Definition and Calculation of Traffic Intensity

Traffic intensity is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that measures the average occupancy of a server or resource during a specified period of time. It is a crucial metric in understanding the behavior of queueing systems and is used in various applications, such as traffic engineering, call center management, and telecommunication networks.

In queueing theory, traffic intensity is defined as the ratio of the time during which a facility is cumulatively occupied to the time this facility is available for occupancy. It is measured in traffic units (erlangs) and is calculated using the following formula:

$$
\lambda = \frac{\text{Average occupancy}}{\text{Available time}}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the traffic intensity, $\text{Average occupancy}$ is the average time a server or resource is occupied, and $\text{Available time}$ is the total time the server or resource is available for occupancy.

A traffic intensity greater than one erlang means that the rate at which customers arrive exceeds the rate at which they can be served, resulting in queuing delay. On the other hand, a traffic intensity less than one erlang indicates that the server or resource is underutilized, and there is room for more traffic.

In telecommunication networks, traffic intensity is a critical metric for operators as it dictates the amount of equipment they must supply. A high traffic intensity means that the network is experiencing high demand, and more equipment may be needed to handle the traffic. Conversely, a low traffic intensity indicates that the network is underutilized, and there may be room for cost-savings by reducing the amount of equipment.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of traffic intensity in more detail and discuss its implications for queueing systems. We will also introduce the concept of Little's Law, a fundamental conservation law in queueing theory that relates the average number of customers in a queue to the average arrival rate and average time a customer spends in the system.




### Subsection: 4.1b Relationship between Traffic Intensity and System Performance

The relationship between traffic intensity and system performance is a crucial aspect of queueing theory. As we have seen in the previous section, traffic intensity is a measure of the average occupancy of a server or resource during a specified period of time. It is a key factor in determining the performance of a queueing system.

When the traffic intensity is high, it means that the rate at which customers arrive exceeds the rate at which they can be served. This results in longer queues and increased waiting times for customers. As a result, the system performance is likely to be poor, with high average queue length, long waiting times, and low customer satisfaction.

On the other hand, when the traffic intensity is low, it means that the server or resource is underutilized. This can lead to shorter queues and lower waiting times for customers. However, if the traffic intensity is too low, it can also result in poor system performance due to inefficient use of resources.

The relationship between traffic intensity and system performance can be further understood through Little's Law, a fundamental conservation law in queueing theory. Little's Law states that the average queue length in a system is equal to the product of the average waiting time and the arrival rate. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

where $L$ is the average queue length, $\lambda$ is the arrival rate, and $W$ is the average waiting time.

From Little's Law, we can see that as the traffic intensity increases, the arrival rate also increases, leading to longer waiting times and higher queue lengths. This, in turn, can result in poor system performance.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of Little's Law in more detail and discuss its implications for queueing systems. We will also introduce the concept of traffic intensity in more detail and discuss its relationship with system performance.




### Subsection: 4.2a Definition and Concept of Balance Equation

The balance equation is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that describes the flow of customers through a system. It is a mathematical representation of the principle of conservation of mass, which states that the mass entering a system must either leave the system or accumulate within the system. In the context of queueing theory, this principle is applied to the flow of customers.

The balance equation for a queueing system can be written as:

$$
\lambda = \mu + \frac{dL}{dt}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the arrival rate, $\mu$ is the service rate, and $\frac{dL}{dt}$ is the rate of change of queue length.

This equation states that the arrival rate is equal to the service rate plus the rate of change of queue length. In other words, the rate at which customers enter the system is equal to the rate at which they are served, plus the rate at which the queue length is changing.

The balance equation is a powerful tool for analyzing queueing systems. It allows us to understand how changes in the system parameters, such as arrival rate or service rate, affect the queue length and system performance. It also helps us to identify potential bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the system.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of the balance equation for queueing systems and discuss how it can be used to analyze system performance.

### Subsection: 4.2b Applications of Balance Equation

The balance equation is a versatile tool that can be applied to a wide range of queueing systems. In this section, we will explore some of the applications of the balance equation in queueing theory.

#### 4.2b.1 Analyzing System Performance

One of the primary applications of the balance equation is in analyzing the performance of queueing systems. By substituting the values of arrival rate, service rate, and queue length change rate into the balance equation, we can determine the system's performance.

For instance, if the arrival rate is high and the service rate is low, the queue length change rate will be positive, indicating that the queue length is increasing. This could be due to a high demand for service or a low number of servers. Conversely, if the arrival rate is low and the service rate is high, the queue length change rate will be negative, indicating that the queue length is decreasing.

The balance equation can also be used to calculate the system's utilization, which is the ratio of the arrival rate to the service rate. A high utilization rate indicates that the system is busy and may be experiencing delays.

#### 4.2b.2 Identifying Bottlenecks

The balance equation can also be used to identify potential bottlenecks in a queueing system. If the service rate is low, it could be due to a bottleneck in the system. By analyzing the balance equation, we can determine whether the bottleneck is caused by a high arrival rate or a low service rate.

For example, if the arrival rate is high but the service rate is low, it could be due to a lack of resources. In this case, adding more servers could help to alleviate the bottleneck. On the other hand, if the arrival rate is low but the service rate is high, it could be due to a complex service process. In this case, simplifying the service process could help to reduce the bottleneck.

#### 4.2b.3 Modeling System Behavior

The balance equation can also be used to model the behavior of queueing systems over time. By incorporating the balance equation into a differential equation, we can describe how the queue length changes over time. This can be useful for predicting system behavior under different conditions.

For instance, if we know the arrival rate, service rate, and initial queue length, we can use the balance equation to predict how the queue length will change over time. This can help us to plan for future changes in the system and to make decisions about resource allocation.

In the next section, we will explore some advanced applications of the balance equation, including its use in modeling systems with multiple queues and its use in analyzing systems with varying arrival and service rates.

### Subsection: 4.2c Balance Equation in Queueing Systems

The balance equation is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that describes the flow of customers through a system. It is a mathematical representation of the principle of conservation of mass, which states that the mass entering a system must either leave the system or accumulate within the system. In the context of queueing theory, this principle is applied to the flow of customers.

The balance equation for a queueing system can be written as:

$$
\lambda = \mu + \frac{dL}{dt}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the arrival rate, $\mu$ is the service rate, and $\frac{dL}{dt}$ is the rate of change of queue length.

This equation states that the arrival rate is equal to the service rate plus the rate of change of queue length. In other words, the rate at which customers enter the system is equal to the rate at which they are served, plus the rate at which the queue length is changing.

The balance equation is a powerful tool for analyzing queueing systems. It allows us to understand how changes in the system parameters, such as arrival rate or service rate, affect the queue length and system performance. It also helps us to identify potential bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the system.

In the context of queueing systems, the balance equation can be used to model the behavior of the system over time. By incorporating the balance equation into a differential equation, we can describe how the queue length changes over time. This can be useful for predicting system behavior under different conditions.

For instance, if we know the arrival rate, service rate, and initial queue length, we can use the balance equation to predict how the queue length will change over time. This can help us to plan for future changes in the system and to make decisions about resource allocation.

In the next section, we will explore some advanced applications of the balance equation in queueing systems.




#### 4.2b Application of Balance Equation in Queueing Systems

The balance equation is a powerful tool that can be applied to a wide range of queueing systems. In this section, we will explore some of the applications of the balance equation in queueing theory.

##### 4.2b.1 Analyzing System Performance

One of the primary applications of the balance equation is in analyzing the performance of queueing systems. By substituting the values of arrival rate, service rate, and queue length change rate into the balance equation, we can determine the system's performance.

For instance, consider a single-server queueing system with arrival rate $\lambda$ and service rate $\mu$. The balance equation for this system can be written as:

$$
\lambda = \mu + \frac{dL}{dt}
$$

where $L$ is the queue length. If we assume that the queue length is changing at a constant rate, we can rearrange this equation to solve for the queue length:

$$
L = \frac{\lambda - \mu}{\mu}
$$

This equation allows us to calculate the queue length in the system, which is a key performance metric. A longer queue length indicates a higher level of congestion and potentially poorer system performance.

##### 4.2b.2 Identifying System Inefficiencies

The balance equation can also be used to identify system inefficiencies. If the arrival rate is greater than the service rate, the right-hand side of the balance equation will be positive, indicating that the queue length is increasing. This could suggest that the system is not able to handle the incoming traffic, and that additional resources may be needed.

Conversely, if the service rate is greater than the arrival rate, the right-hand side of the balance equation will be negative, indicating that the queue length is decreasing. This could suggest that the system has excess capacity and that resources could be reallocated to other areas.

##### 4.2b.3 Modeling System Behavior

The balance equation can also be used to model the behavior of queueing systems over time. By incorporating the balance equation into a differential equation model, we can predict how the queue length will change over time in response to changes in the arrival rate, service rate, or queue length change rate.

For example, consider a queueing system with a constant arrival rate $\lambda$ and a service rate that varies over time according to the function $\mu(t)$. The balance equation for this system can be written as:

$$
\lambda = \mu(t) + \frac{dL}{dt}
$$

This equation can be incorporated into a differential equation model to predict how the queue length will change over time. This can be particularly useful for understanding the long-term behavior of queueing systems, which can be difficult to predict intuitively.

In conclusion, the balance equation is a versatile tool that can be applied to a wide range of queueing systems. By understanding and applying the balance equation, we can gain valuable insights into the performance, inefficiencies, and behavior of queueing systems.




#### 4.3a Definition and Principles of Network Flow Conservation

Network flow conservation is a fundamental principle in queueing theory that describes the behavior of traffic flowing through a network. It is based on the concept of conservation of flow, which states that the total amount of flow entering a node must equal the total amount of flow leaving the node. This principle is applied to queueing systems to ensure that the total amount of traffic entering a system is equal to the total amount of traffic leaving the system.

In the context of queueing theory, network flow conservation is often expressed mathematically as the balance equation, which states that the arrival rate of traffic to a system is equal to the service rate plus the rate of change of queue length. This equation can be written as:

$$
\lambda = \mu + \frac{dL}{dt}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the arrival rate, $\mu$ is the service rate, and $L$ is the queue length.

The principle of network flow conservation is particularly useful in analyzing the performance of queueing systems. By ensuring that the total amount of traffic entering a system is equal to the total amount of traffic leaving the system, we can avoid overloading the system and ensure that all traffic is served in a timely manner.

In the next section, we will explore some of the applications of network flow conservation in queueing theory.

#### 4.3b Application of Network Flow Conservation in Queueing Systems

The principle of network flow conservation is applied in various queueing systems to ensure efficient and fair service to all users. One such application is in the design of packet-based communication systems, where the principle is used to control the rate at which packets are transmitted.

In packet-based communication systems, data is transmitted in discrete packets. The principle of network flow conservation is used to ensure that the total amount of data entering a system is equal to the total amount of data leaving the system. This is achieved by controlling the rate at which packets are transmitted.

The rate of packet transmission is controlled by a mechanism known as packet scheduling. Packet scheduling is a technique used to determine the order in which packets are transmitted. The goal of packet scheduling is to ensure that all packets are transmitted in a fair and efficient manner.

One common packet scheduling algorithm that uses the principle of network flow conservation is the fair queuing algorithm. The fair queuing algorithm ensures that each packet is transmitted in the order it arrived, with no packet being transmitted before all previously arrived packets. This ensures that all packets are served in a fair and efficient manner.

The fair queuing algorithm can be mathematically represented as follows:

$$
\lambda = \mu + \frac{dL}{dt}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the arrival rate of packets, $\mu$ is the service rate (i.e., the rate at which packets are transmitted), and $L$ is the queue length (i.e., the number of packets waiting to be transmitted).

By ensuring that the arrival rate of packets is equal to the service rate plus the rate of change of queue length, the fair queuing algorithm guarantees that the total amount of data entering a system is equal to the total amount of data leaving the system. This ensures that the system is operating within its capacity and that all packets are served in a fair and efficient manner.

In the next section, we will explore another application of network flow conservation in queueing theory: the use of the principle to analyze the performance of queueing systems.

#### 4.3c Challenges in Network Flow Conservation

While the principle of network flow conservation is a powerful tool in queueing theory, it is not without its challenges. These challenges often arise due to the inherent complexity of real-world queueing systems, which may not perfectly align with the assumptions made in the theoretical models.

One of the main challenges in applying network flow conservation in queueing systems is the issue of packet loss. In packet-based communication systems, packets may be lost due to network congestion or other factors. This can lead to a violation of the principle of network flow conservation, as the total amount of data entering a system may no longer be equal to the total amount of data leaving the system.

Packet loss can be particularly problematic in systems that use the fair queuing algorithm. If packets are lost, the fair queuing algorithm may no longer be able to ensure that all packets are served in the order they arrived. This can lead to a violation of fairness, with some packets being served before others.

Another challenge in applying network flow conservation is the issue of queueing discipline. The principle of network flow conservation assumes that packets are served in the order they arrived. However, in real-world systems, other queueing disciplines may be used. For example, packets may be served based on their priority, with higher-priority packets being served before lower-priority packets.

This can lead to a violation of the principle of network flow conservation, as the order in which packets are served may no longer be the same as the order in which they arrived. This can make it difficult to apply the fair queuing algorithm, and can lead to a violation of fairness.

Finally, the principle of network flow conservation assumes that the system is operating within its capacity. However, in real-world systems, this may not always be the case. The system may be overloaded, leading to delays and packet loss. This can make it difficult to apply the principle of network flow conservation, and can lead to a violation of the principle.

Despite these challenges, the principle of network flow conservation remains a powerful tool in queueing theory. By understanding these challenges and developing strategies to address them, we can continue to apply the principle to analyze and optimize queueing systems.




#### 4.3b Analyzing Network Flow Conservation in Queueing Systems

In the previous section, we discussed the application of network flow conservation in packet-based communication systems. In this section, we will delve deeper into the analysis of network flow conservation in queueing systems.

The principle of network flow conservation is a powerful tool for analyzing the performance of queueing systems. It allows us to understand how traffic flows through a system and how changes in the system can affect the overall traffic flow.

One way to analyze network flow conservation in queueing systems is through the use of Little's Law. Little's Law states that the average number of packets in a queue is equal to the average time a packet spends in the queue multiplied by the average arrival rate of packets. This law can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
L = \lambda \cdot W
$$

where $L$ is the average number of packets in the queue, $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate of packets, and $W$ is the average time a packet spends in the queue.

By applying Little's Law to a queueing system, we can gain insights into the system's performance. For example, if the average number of packets in the queue is high, it indicates that the system is experiencing high traffic and may need to be scaled up to handle the load. Similarly, if the average time a packet spends in the queue is high, it suggests that the system may be experiencing delays and may need to be optimized for better performance.

Another way to analyze network flow conservation in queueing systems is through the use of the balance equation. As mentioned earlier, the balance equation states that the arrival rate of traffic to a system is equal to the service rate plus the rate of change of queue length. This equation can be used to understand how changes in the system, such as changes in the arrival rate or service rate, can affect the overall traffic flow.

In conclusion, the principle of network flow conservation is a powerful tool for analyzing the performance of queueing systems. By understanding and applying this principle, we can gain insights into the system's performance and make informed decisions about how to optimize the system for better performance.

#### 4.3c Challenges in Network Flow Conservation

While the principles of network flow conservation and Little's Law provide valuable insights into the performance of queueing systems, there are several challenges that can complicate their application. These challenges often arise from the inherent complexity of queueing systems and the assumptions made in their analysis.

One of the main challenges in applying Little's Law is the assumption of a stable system. Little's Law assumes that the arrival rate and service rate are constant over time. However, in many queueing systems, these rates can vary significantly due to factors such as changes in network traffic, system failures, or changes in system configuration. This can lead to inaccuracies in the analysis and can make it difficult to predict the system's performance.

Another challenge is the assumption of a single-server queue. In many queueing systems, there are multiple servers handling the traffic. This can complicate the application of Little's Law, as the average arrival rate and service rate must be calculated across all servers. This can be particularly challenging in systems with varying server capacities or where servers are shared among multiple queues.

The balance equation, which states that the arrival rate is equal to the service rate plus the rate of change of queue length, also has its challenges. One of these is the assumption of a single queue. In reality, queueing systems often have multiple queues, each with its own arrival and service rates. This can make it difficult to apply the balance equation, as it assumes a single queue.

Finally, the assumption of a Poisson arrival process is another challenge in the application of queueing theory. In many queueing systems, the arrival process is not strictly Poisson, and this can lead to inaccuracies in the analysis. For example, in systems with bursty traffic or correlated arrivals, the arrival process may not be well-approximated by a Poisson process.

Despite these challenges, queueing theory remains a powerful tool for analyzing the performance of queueing systems. By understanding these challenges and taking them into account in the analysis, we can gain valuable insights into the system's performance and make informed decisions about how to optimize it.

## Chapter 5: Advanced Applications:




### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the concept of PASTA (Poisson Arrivals See Time Averages), a fundamental property in queueing theory. PASTA is a powerful tool that allows us to simplify the analysis of queueing systems by making certain assumptions about the arrival process. It is a key concept that is widely used in the field of queueing theory and has numerous applications in various fields such as telecommunications, computer networks, and manufacturing systems.

The PASTA property is based on the assumption that the arrivals to a queueing system are governed by a Poisson process and that the time averages of the system are equal to the long-run averages. This assumption allows us to make simplifications in the analysis of queueing systems, leading to more tractable models and solutions.

We will begin by introducing the basic concepts of PASTA, including the Poisson process and time averages. We will then explore the implications of the PASTA property on the analysis of queueing systems. We will also discuss the conditions under which the PASTA property holds and its limitations.

Furthermore, we will examine the applications of PASTA in various queueing systems, including single-server queues, multi-server queues, and networks of queues. We will also discuss how the PASTA property can be used to derive performance measures such as the average queue length, waiting time, and throughput.

Finally, we will conclude the chapter by discussing the advanced applications of PASTA, including its use in modeling and analyzing complex queueing systems. We will also touch upon the current research trends and future directions in the field of PASTA.

In summary, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the PASTA property, its applications, and its implications in queueing theory. It is designed to be a valuable resource for students, researchers, and practitioners in the field of queueing theory. 




### Section: 5.1 Probability of Arrival:

The concept of probability of arrival is a fundamental concept in queueing theory. It is defined as the probability that a customer will arrive at a particular time. In this section, we will explore the definition and calculation of probability of arrival, and its implications in queueing systems.

#### 5.1a Definition and Calculation of Probability of Arrival

The probability of arrival, denoted as $P_a(t)$, is defined as the probability that a customer will arrive at a particular time $t$. It is a function of time and is typically represented as a probability density function. The probability of arrival is a crucial concept in queueing theory as it helps us understand the behavior of customers in a queueing system.

The calculation of probability of arrival can be done using various methods, depending on the specific characteristics of the queueing system. In general, the probability of arrival can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
P_a(t) = \frac{dN(t)}{dT}
$$

where $N(t)$ is the number of arrivals up to time $t$, and $T$ is the total time period. This formula gives us the probability of arrival at any given time $t$.

In the context of PASTA, the probability of arrival is particularly important as it helps us understand the behavior of arrivals in a queueing system. PASTA assumes that the arrivals to a queueing system are governed by a Poisson process, and that the time averages of the system are equal to the long-run averages. This means that the probability of arrival at any given time is equal to the long-run average probability of arrival.

#### 5.1b Implications of Probability of Arrival in Queueing Systems

The probability of arrival has several implications in queueing systems. One of the key implications is that it helps us understand the behavior of arrivals in a queueing system. By calculating the probability of arrival, we can determine the likelihood of a customer arriving at a particular time, which can be useful in predicting the behavior of the queueing system.

Furthermore, the probability of arrival is also closely related to the concept of arrival rate. The arrival rate, denoted as $\lambda$, is defined as the average number of arrivals per unit time. It is typically represented as a constant value in queueing systems. The probability of arrival and arrival rate are closely related, as the arrival rate can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
\lambda = \int_{0}^{\infty} P_a(t) dt
$$

This formula shows that the arrival rate is the integral of the probability of arrival over all time. This means that the arrival rate is a measure of the total probability of arrival over all time, rather than just at a specific time.

In the context of PASTA, the probability of arrival and arrival rate are particularly important as they help us understand the behavior of arrivals in a queueing system. By understanding the probability of arrival and arrival rate, we can make predictions about the behavior of the queueing system and make decisions about how to optimize it.

#### 5.1c Applications of Probability of Arrival

The concept of probability of arrival has numerous applications in queueing theory. One of the key applications is in the analysis of queueing systems. By understanding the probability of arrival, we can make predictions about the behavior of the queueing system and make decisions about how to optimize it.

Furthermore, the probability of arrival is also used in the calculation of other important performance measures in queueing systems. For example, the average queue length and waiting time can be calculated using the probability of arrival and arrival rate. This allows us to understand the overall performance of the queueing system and make decisions about how to improve it.

In addition, the probability of arrival is also used in the design of queueing systems. By understanding the probability of arrival, we can design queueing systems that are optimized for specific scenarios and improve the overall performance of the system.

In conclusion, the probability of arrival is a crucial concept in queueing theory. It helps us understand the behavior of arrivals in a queueing system and make predictions about the performance of the system. By understanding the probability of arrival, we can optimize queueing systems and improve their overall performance.

where $N(t)$ is the number of arrivals up to time $t$, and $T$ is the total time period. This formula gives us the probability of arrival at any given time $t$.

In the context of PASTA, the probability of arrival is particularly important as it helps us understand the behavior of arrivals in a queueing system. PASTA assumes that the arrivals to a queueing system are governed by a Poisson process, and that the time averages of the system are equal to the long-run averages. This means that the probability of arrival at any given time is equal to the long-run average probability of arrival.

#### 5.1b Understanding Arrival Patterns in Queueing Systems

The probability of arrival is a crucial concept in queueing theory as it helps us understand the behavior of arrivals in a queueing system. By analyzing the probability of arrival, we can gain insights into the arrival patterns in a queueing system. This is particularly important in the context of PASTA, where we assume that the arrivals are governed by a Poisson process.

In a Poisson process, the arrivals are assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). This means that the probability of arrival at any given time is equal to the long-run average probability of arrival. This assumption is crucial in PASTA, as it allows us to make predictions about the behavior of arrivals in a queueing system.

By understanding the arrival patterns in a queueing system, we can make informed decisions about the design and management of the system. For example, if we know the probability of arrival at different times of the day, we can adjust the staffing levels accordingly to ensure efficient service. Additionally, by understanding the arrival patterns, we can identify potential bottlenecks and make improvements to the system to reduce wait times and improve customer satisfaction.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of PASTA in more detail and discuss its applications in queueing theory.





### Section: 5.2 Probability of Service:

The concept of probability of service is a fundamental concept in queueing theory. It is defined as the probability that a customer will be served at a particular time. In this section, we will explore the definition and calculation of probability of service, and its implications in queueing systems.

#### 5.2a Definition and Calculation of Probability of Service

The probability of service, denoted as $P_s(t)$, is defined as the probability that a customer will be served at a particular time $t$. It is a function of time and is typically represented as a probability density function. The probability of service is a crucial concept in queueing theory as it helps us understand the behavior of customers in a queueing system.

The calculation of probability of service can be done using various methods, depending on the specific characteristics of the queueing system. In general, the probability of service can be calculated using the following formula:

$$
P_s(t) = \frac{dN_s(t)}{dT}
$$

where $N_s(t)$ is the number of service completions up to time $t$, and $T$ is the total time period. This formula gives us the probability of service at any given time $t$.

In the context of PASTA, the probability of service is particularly important as it helps us understand the behavior of service completions in a queueing system. PASTA assumes that the service completions to a queueing system are governed by a Poisson process, and that the time averages of the system are equal to the long-run averages. This means that the probability of service at any given time is equal to the long-run average probability of service.

One way to understand service patterns is through the concept of Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in a queueing system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. This law can be extended to understand the service patterns in a queueing system.

Another way to understand service patterns is through the concept of Buzen's algorithm, which is an efficient procedure for computing the normalizing constant $G(N)$ in a closed queueing network with multiple service facilities and circulating customers. This algorithm helps us understand the steady state probabilities of the number of customers at each service facility, which can then be used to calculate the probability of service at any given time.

In summary, the probability of service is a crucial concept in queueing theory, and it helps us understand the behavior of service completions in a queueing system. By analyzing the probability of service, we can gain insights into the service patterns in a queueing system, which is particularly important in the context of PASTA.

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamentals of queueing theory, including the basic concepts, models, and applications. We have also delved into the world of advanced queueing theory, discussing various techniques and methods for analyzing complex queueing systems. In this chapter, we will continue our journey into the realm of advanced queueing theory, focusing on systems with no overtaking and exact solutions.

Queueing systems with no overtaking are a special class of queueing systems where the order in which customers are served is the same as the order in which they arrived. This property simplifies the analysis of these systems, making them a popular choice in many real-world scenarios. We will explore the characteristics of these systems, their mathematical models, and the techniques used to analyze them.

#### 6.1a Definition and Analysis of FIFO Queueing System

The First-In-First-Out (FIFO) queueing system is a fundamental concept in queueing theory. It is a single-server queueing system where customers arrive at a single queue and are served in the order of their arrival. This system is often used in real-world scenarios such as supermarkets, banks, and call centers.

The FIFO system can be mathematically modeled using the concept of virtual time, as discussed in the previous context. The virtual finish time for a newly queued packet is given by the sum of the virtual start time plus the packet's size. The virtual start time is the maximum between the previous virtual finish time of the same queue and the current instant.

The complexity of the FIFO system is "O(log(n))", where "n" is the number of queues/flows. This complexity is due to the need to recompute the finish time for previously queued packets every time a new packet arrives into any queue. However, the use of virtual time helps to reduce the computational load.

The FIFO system is a special case of the more general concept of systems with no overtaking. In these systems, the order in which customers are served is the same as the order in which they arrived. This property simplifies the analysis of these systems, making them a popular choice in many real-world scenarios.

The FIFO system is also a popular choice due to its fairness. By serving customers in the order of their arrival, the FIFO system ensures that no customer is unfairly prioritized over others. This is particularly important in systems where customers have different levels of urgency or importance.

In the next section, we will delve into the mathematical analysis of the FIFO system, including the derivation of exact solutions for various performance measures.

#### 6.1b Performance Measures in FIFO Queueing System

The performance of a queueing system can be evaluated using various performance measures. These measures provide insights into the system's efficiency, fairness, and responsiveness to changes in traffic conditions. In the context of the FIFO queueing system, these measures can be calculated using the virtual finish time and the virtual start time.

The average waiting time is a common performance measure in queueing systems. It represents the average amount of time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. In the FIFO system, the average waiting time can be calculated as the difference between the virtual finish time and the virtual start time for a newly queued packet. This measure is particularly useful in evaluating the system's responsiveness to changes in traffic conditions.

The average queue length is another important performance measure. It represents the average number of customers in the queue. In the FIFO system, the average queue length can be calculated as the difference between the virtual finish time and the virtual start time for all packets in the queue. This measure is particularly useful in evaluating the system's efficiency.

The average number of customers in the system is a measure of the system's utilization. It represents the average number of customers in the system, including those being served and those waiting in the queue. In the FIFO system, the average number of customers in the system can be calculated as the sum of the average waiting time and the average queue length. This measure is particularly useful in evaluating the system's fairness.

The average response time is a measure of the system's responsiveness. It represents the average amount of time a customer spends in the system, including the time spent waiting in the queue and the time spent being served. In the FIFO system, the average response time can be calculated as the sum of the average waiting time and the service time. This measure is particularly useful in evaluating the system's efficiency and responsiveness to changes in traffic conditions.

In the next section, we will delve into the mathematical analysis of these performance measures in the context of the FIFO queueing system.

#### 6.1c Applications of FIFO Queueing System

##### Telecommunication Networks

In telecommunication networks, the FIFO queueing system is often used to manage the flow of data packets. The system's fairness ensures that all packets are served in the order of their arrival, preventing any packet from being unfairly prioritized over others. This is particularly important in networks where packets have different levels of urgency or importance.

#### 6.1b Performance Measures in FIFO Queueing System

The performance of a queueing system can be evaluated using various performance measures. These measures provide insights into the system's efficiency, fairness, and ability to handle different types of traffic. In this section, we will discuss some of the key performance measures for the FIFO queueing system.

##### Average Queue Length

The average queue length is a measure of the average number of customers waiting in the queue. It is a measure of the system's efficiency. A lower average queue length indicates that the system is able to process customers quickly, while a higher average queue length suggests that the system is congested and may need to be scaled up.

The average queue length in the FIFO queueing system can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average queue length is equal to the average time a customer spends in the system multiplied by the average arrival rate of customers. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

where $L$ is the average queue length, $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate, and $W$ is the average time a customer spends in the system.

##### Average Waiting Time

The average waiting time is a measure of the average time a customer spends waiting in the queue. It is a measure of the system's fairness. A longer average waiting time for some customers may indicate that the system is not fair, while a shorter average waiting time for all customers suggests that the system is fair.

The average waiting time in the FIFO queueing system can be calculated using the Little's Law formula. It can also be calculated directly from the average queue length and the average arrival rate:

$$
W = \frac{L}{\lambda}
$$

##### Throughput

The throughput is a measure of the system's capacity. It is the average number of customers that the system can process per unit time. A higher throughput indicates that the system can handle more traffic, while a lower throughput suggests that the system may be overloaded.

The throughput in the FIFO queueing system can be calculated using the Little's Law formula. It can also be calculated directly from the average queue length and the average waiting time:

$$
X = \frac{\lambda}{W}
$$

##### Fairness Index

The fairness index is a measure of the system's fairness. It is a ratio of the maximum waiting time to the minimum waiting time. A fairness index close to 1 indicates that the system is very fair, while a fairness index close to infinity indicates that the system is not fair.

The fairness index in the FIFO queueing system can be calculated using the formula:

$$
F = \frac{W_{max}}{W_{min}}
$$

where $W_{max}$ is the maximum waiting time and $W_{min}$ is the minimum waiting time.

In the next section, we will discuss how these performance measures can be calculated for the FIFO queueing system.

#### 6.1c Applications of FIFO Queueing System

The FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queueing system is a fundamental concept in queueing theory and has a wide range of applications in various fields. In this section, we will discuss some of the key applications of the FIFO queueing system.

##### Telecommunication Networks

In telecommunication networks, the FIFO queueing system is used to manage the flow of data packets. The packets are queued in the order of their arrival and served in the same order. This ensures that the first packet to arrive is the first to be served, which is a fair policy. The FIFO queueing system is particularly useful in networks with a high volume of traffic, where the order of packet arrival can significantly impact the network's performance.

##### Computer Systems

In computer systems, the FIFO queueing system is used to manage the execution of processes. The processes are queued in the order of their arrival and served in the same order. This ensures that the first process to arrive is the first to be executed, which is a fair policy. The FIFO queueing system is particularly useful in systems with a high volume of processes, where the order of process arrival can significantly impact the system's performance.

##### Manufacturing Systems

In manufacturing systems, the FIFO queueing system is used to manage the flow of jobs. The jobs are queued in the order of their arrival and served in the same order. This ensures that the first job to arrive is the first to be served, which is a fair policy. The FIFO queueing system is particularly useful in systems with a high volume of jobs, where the order of job arrival can significantly impact the system's performance.

##### Network Traffic Modeling

The FIFO queueing system is also used in network traffic modeling. By modeling the network as a FIFO queueing system, we can analyze the network's performance under different traffic conditions. This can help us design more efficient networks and predict their behavior under different loads.

In conclusion, the FIFO queueing system is a versatile tool with a wide range of applications. Its simplicity and fairness make it a popular choice in many fields. In the next section, we will discuss some advanced applications of the FIFO queueing system.




#### 6.2a Definition and Analysis of LIFO Queueing System

The Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) queueing system is another fundamental concept in queueing theory. Unlike the FIFO system, where customers are served in the order of their arrival, the LIFO system serves customers in the reverse order of their arrival. This system is often used in scenarios where the last customer to arrive is the most important or has the highest priority.

The LIFO queueing system can be modeled using the same assumptions as the FIFO system, with the exception that the service order is reversed. This means that the service time for each customer is still exponentially distributed, but the customers are served in the reverse order of their arrival.

#### 6.2b Performance Measures in LIFO Queueing System

The performance of the LIFO queueing system can also be evaluated using various performance measures. These measures provide insights into the system's efficiency, fairness, and ability to handle different types of traffic. In this section, we will discuss some of the key performance measures for the LIFO queueing system.

##### Average Queue Length

The average queue length in the LIFO queueing system can be calculated using Little's Law, similar to the FIFO system. However, the average queue length in the LIFO system is typically higher than in the FIFO system, due to the reversed service order. This means that customers who arrived earlier may have to wait longer for service, leading to a higher average queue length.

##### Average Waiting Time

The average waiting time in the LIFO queueing system can also be calculated using Little's Law. However, the average waiting time in the LIFO system is typically lower than in the FIFO system, due to the reversed service order. This means that customers who arrived earlier may have to wait less for service, leading to a lower average waiting time.

##### Throughput

The throughput in the LIFO queueing system can be calculated using the same formula as in the FIFO system. However, the throughput in the LIFO system is typically lower than in the FIFO system, due to the reversed service order. This means that the system may not be able to handle as much traffic, leading to a lower throughput.

In the next section, we will discuss the LIFO queueing system with multiple servers, where customers can be served simultaneously by multiple servers.

#### 6.2b Analysis of LIFO Queueing System

The LIFO queueing system, while seemingly simple, has some interesting characteristics that make it a valuable tool in certain scenarios. In this section, we will delve deeper into the analysis of the LIFO queueing system, focusing on its performance measures and how they differ from those of the FIFO system.

##### Average Queue Length

As mentioned earlier, the average queue length in the LIFO queueing system is typically higher than in the FIFO system. This is due to the reversed service order, which means that customers who arrived earlier may have to wait longer for service. This can be quantified using Little's Law, which states that the average queue length is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. In the LIFO system, this average time is typically higher due to the reversed service order.

##### Average Waiting Time

The average waiting time in the LIFO queueing system is typically lower than in the FIFO system. This is because customers who arrived earlier may have to wait less for service due to the reversed service order. This can also be quantified using Little's Law, which states that the average waiting time is equal to the average queue length divided by the average arrival rate. In the LIFO system, this average queue length is typically higher, leading to a lower average waiting time.

##### Throughput

The throughput in the LIFO queueing system is typically lower than in the FIFO system. This is due to the reversed service order, which means that the system may not be able to handle as much traffic. The throughput can be calculated using the same formula as in the FIFO system, which is the average arrival rate multiplied by the average service time. However, in the LIFO system, this average service time is typically higher due to the reversed service order, leading to a lower throughput.

In conclusion, the LIFO queueing system, while seemingly simple, has some interesting characteristics that make it a valuable tool in certain scenarios. Its performance measures, while typically higher than those of the FIFO system, can be quantified using Little's Law and provide valuable insights into the system's efficiency and fairness.

#### 6.2c LIFO Queueing System in Real World Scenarios

The Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) queueing system is not just a theoretical concept, but it has practical applications in various real-world scenarios. In this section, we will explore some of these scenarios and how the LIFO system is used.

##### Call Center Queuing

In call center operations, the LIFO system is often used to handle customer calls. The system ensures that the last customer to call is the first to be served, which can be particularly useful in situations where customers have high expectations for service speed. This is because the LIFO system can help reduce the average waiting time for customers, as those who arrived earlier may have to wait less for service due to the reversed service order.

##### Traffic Flow Management

The LIFO system can also be used in traffic flow management, particularly in situations where there are multiple lanes of traffic. By using the LIFO system, vehicles can be served in the reverse order of their arrival, which can help reduce congestion and improve traffic flow. This is because the LIFO system can help reduce the average queue length, as customers who arrived earlier may have to wait less for service due to the reversed service order.

##### Resource Allocation

In resource allocation problems, the LIFO system can be used to allocate resources in a fair manner. For example, in a computer system, the LIFO system can be used to allocate processing time to different processes. This is because the LIFO system can help ensure that processes are served in a fair manner, as those who arrived earlier may have to wait less for service due to the reversed service order.

In conclusion, the LIFO queueing system, while seemingly simple, has practical applications in various real-world scenarios. Its ability to reduce the average waiting time and queue length makes it a valuable tool in call center operations, traffic flow management, and resource allocation.




#### 6.2b Performance Measures in LIFO Queueing System

The performance of the LIFO queueing system can also be evaluated using various performance measures. These measures provide insights into the system's efficiency, fairness, and ability to handle different types of traffic. In this section, we will discuss some of the key performance measures for the LIFO queueing system.

##### Average Queue Length

The average queue length in the LIFO queueing system can be calculated using Little's Law, similar to the FIFO system. However, the average queue length in the LIFO system is typically higher than in the FIFO system, due to the reversed service order. This means that customers who arrived earlier may have to wait longer for service, leading to a higher average queue length.

##### Average Waiting Time

The average waiting time in the LIFO queueing system can also be calculated using Little's Law. However, the average waiting time in the LIFO system is typically lower than in the FIFO system, due to the reversed service order. This means that customers who arrived earlier may have to wait less for service, leading to a lower average waiting time.

##### Throughput

The throughput in the LIFO queueing system can be calculated using the same formula as for the FIFO system, i.e., $X = \lambda(1 - P_0)$, where $X$ is the throughput, $\lambda$ is the arrival rate, and $P_0$ is the probability of no customers in the system. However, the throughput in the LIFO system is typically lower than in the FIFO system, due to the reversed service order. This means that customers who arrived earlier may have to wait longer for service, leading to a lower throughput.

##### Fairness

The fairness of the LIFO queueing system can be evaluated using the fairness index, as defined in the previous chapter. However, due to the reversed service order, the fairness index in the LIFO system is typically lower than in the FIFO system. This means that customers who arrived earlier may have to wait longer for service, leading to a lower fairness index.

##### Response Time

The response time in the LIFO queueing system can be calculated using the same formula as for the FIFO system, i.e., $W = W_q + S$, where $W$ is the response time, $W_q$ is the waiting time, and $S$ is the service time. However, the response time in the LIFO system is typically lower than in the FIFO system, due to the reversed service order. This means that customers who arrived earlier may have to wait less for service, leading to a lower response time.

##### Little's Law

Little's Law can also be applied to the LIFO queueing system, with the average queue length, average waiting time, and throughput as defined above. However, due to the reversed service order, Little's Law in the LIFO system is typically different from that in the FIFO system. This means that the average queue length, average waiting time, and throughput in the LIFO system may be higher or lower than in the FIFO system, depending on the specific system parameters.




#### 6.3a Definition and Analysis of Priority Queueing System

A priority queueing system is a type of queueing system where customers are served based on their priority level. Customers with higher priority levels are served before customers with lower priority levels. This system is often used in situations where certain customers require immediate attention or where there are limited resources available.

The priority queueing system can be modeled using the concept of virtual time, as discussed in the previous chapter. In this system, the virtual time is advanced whenever a high-priority customer arrives or a low-priority customer departs. This ensures that high-priority customers are served as soon as possible, without causing delays for low-priority customers.

The performance of the priority queueing system can be analyzed using various performance measures, similar to other queueing systems. These measures include the average queue length, average waiting time, throughput, and fairness index. However, due to the nature of the priority system, these measures may not be as straightforward to calculate as in other systems.

For example, the average queue length in the priority queueing system can be calculated using Little's Law, similar to other queueing systems. However, the average queue length in the priority system may vary depending on the priority level of the customers. Customers with higher priority levels may have a shorter average queue length, while customers with lower priority levels may have a longer average queue length.

The average waiting time in the priority queueing system can also be calculated using Little's Law. However, the average waiting time in the priority system may vary depending on the priority level of the customers. Customers with higher priority levels may have a shorter average waiting time, while customers with lower priority levels may have a longer average waiting time.

The throughput in the priority queueing system can be calculated using the same formula as for other queueing systems, i.e., $X = \lambda(1 - P_0)$, where $X$ is the throughput, $\lambda$ is the arrival rate, and $P_0$ is the probability of no customers in the system. However, the throughput in the priority system may vary depending on the priority level of the customers. Customers with higher priority levels may have a higher throughput, while customers with lower priority levels may have a lower throughput.

The fairness index in the priority queueing system can be calculated using the same formula as for other queueing systems, i.e., $F = \frac{1}{1 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} (P_i - P_{avg})^2}$, where $F$ is the fairness index, $P_i$ is the probability of a customer with priority level $i$, and $P_{avg}$ is the average probability of a customer. However, the fairness index in the priority system may vary depending on the priority level of the customers. Customers with higher priority levels may have a higher fairness index, while customers with lower priority levels may have a lower fairness index.

In the next section, we will discuss some advanced applications of the priority queueing system.

#### 6.3b Performance Measures in Priority Queueing System

The performance of a priority queueing system can be evaluated using various performance measures. These measures provide insights into the system's efficiency, fairness, and ability to handle different types of traffic. In this section, we will discuss some of the key performance measures for the priority queueing system.

##### Average Queue Length

The average queue length in the priority queueing system can be calculated using Little's Law, similar to other queueing systems. However, the average queue length in the priority system may vary depending on the priority level of the customers. Customers with higher priority levels may have a shorter average queue length, while customers with lower priority levels may have a longer average queue length.

The average queue length for each priority level $i$ can be calculated using the formula:

$$
L_i = \frac{\lambda_i}{\mu_i - \lambda_i}
$$

where $\lambda_i$ is the arrival rate for priority level $i$ and $\mu_i$ is the service rate for priority level $i$.

##### Average Waiting Time

The average waiting time in the priority queueing system can also be calculated using Little's Law. However, the average waiting time in the priority system may vary depending on the priority level of the customers. Customers with higher priority levels may have a shorter average waiting time, while customers with lower priority levels may have a longer average waiting time.

The average waiting time for each priority level $i$ can be calculated using the formula:

$$
W_i = \frac{L_i}{\lambda_i}
$$

where $L_i$ is the average queue length for priority level $i$ and $\lambda_i$ is the arrival rate for priority level $i$.

##### Throughput

The throughput in the priority queueing system can be calculated using the same formula as for other queueing systems, i.e., $X = \lambda(1 - P_0)$, where $X$ is the throughput, $\lambda$ is the arrival rate, and $P_0$ is the probability of no customers in the system. However, the throughput in the priority system may vary depending on the priority level of the customers. Customers with higher priority levels may have a higher throughput, while customers with lower priority levels may have a lower throughput.

The throughput for each priority level $i$ can be calculated using the formula:

$$
X_i = \lambda_i(1 - P_{0i})
$$

where $\lambda_i$ is the arrival rate for priority level $i$ and $P_{0i}$ is the probability of no customers in the system for priority level $i$.

##### Fairness Index

The fairness index in the priority queueing system can be calculated using the same formula as for other queueing systems, i.e., $F = \frac{1}{1 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} (P_i - P_{avg})^2}$, where $F$ is the fairness index, $P_i$ is the probability of a customer with priority level $i$, and $P_{avg}$ is the average probability of a customer. However, the fairness index in the priority system may vary depending on the priority level of the customers. Customers with higher priority levels may have a higher fairness index, while customers with lower priority levels may have a lower fairness index.

The fairness index for each priority level $i$ can be calculated using the formula:

$$
F_i = \frac{1}{1 + \sum_{j=1}^{n} (P_{ij} - P_{avg})^2}
$$

where $P_{ij}$ is the probability of a customer with priority level $i$ and service level $j$, and $P_{avg}$ is the average probability of a customer with priority level $i$.

#### 6.3c Applications of Priority Queueing System

The priority queueing system has a wide range of applications in various fields. Its ability to handle different types of traffic and prioritize customers based on their needs makes it a valuable tool in many scenarios. In this section, we will discuss some of the key applications of the priority queueing system.

##### Telecommunication Networks

In telecommunication networks, the priority queueing system is used to manage the flow of data packets. The system can prioritize high-priority packets, such as voice calls or video streams, over low-priority packets, such as email or web browsing. This ensures that critical data is transmitted without delay, while non-critical data can be queued and transmitted when resources are available.

##### Computer Systems

In computer systems, the priority queueing system is used to manage the execution of tasks. High-priority tasks, such as system maintenance or critical processes, can be executed before low-priority tasks, such as user applications. This ensures that critical tasks are completed without delay, while non-critical tasks can be queued and executed when resources are available.

##### Manufacturing and Production

In manufacturing and production, the priority queueing system is used to manage the flow of jobs. High-priority jobs, such as urgent orders or critical processes, can be executed before low-priority jobs, such as routine maintenance or non-critical tasks. This ensures that critical jobs are completed without delay, while non-critical jobs can be queued and executed when resources are available.

##### Healthcare Systems

In healthcare systems, the priority queueing system is used to manage patient flow. High-priority patients, such as emergency cases or critical patients, can be treated before low-priority patients, such as routine check-ups or non-urgent cases. This ensures that critical patients are treated without delay, while non-critical patients can be queued and treated when resources are available.

##### Traffic Management

In traffic management, the priority queueing system is used to manage the flow of vehicles. High-priority vehicles, such as emergency vehicles or public transportation, can be given priority over low-priority vehicles, such as private cars. This ensures that critical vehicles are able to pass through traffic without delay, while non-critical vehicles can be queued and allowed to pass when resources are available.

In conclusion, the priority queueing system is a versatile tool that can be applied in a variety of fields. Its ability to handle different types of traffic and prioritize customers based on their needs makes it a valuable tool in many scenarios.

### Introduction

Queueing theory is a fundamental concept in the field of operations research and computer science. It is a mathematical model used to study the behavior of systems where customers or jobs arrive, wait in a queue, and are eventually served. In this chapter, we delve deeper into the advanced topics of queueing theory, building upon the foundational knowledge established in the previous chapters.

We will explore the intricacies of queueing theory, focusing on advanced topics such as multi-server queues, finite-capacity queues, and queueing networks. These topics are crucial in understanding and analyzing complex systems where multiple servers are involved, where the queue capacity is limited, and where multiple queues interact with each other.

The chapter will also cover advanced techniques for analyzing queueing systems, including the use of generating functions and the concept of traffic intensity. These tools are essential for understanding the behavior of queueing systems and predicting their performance under different conditions.

Furthermore, we will discuss the application of queueing theory in various fields, including telecommunications, computer systems, and manufacturing. This will provide a practical perspective on the theory, demonstrating its relevance and usefulness in real-world scenarios.

#### 6.3b Performance Measures in Priority Queueing System

In the previous section, we discussed the average queue length and average waiting time in the priority queueing system. In this section, we will explore other performance measures that are important in evaluating the performance of a priority queueing system.

One such measure is the throughput, which is defined as the average number of customers served per unit time. In the priority queueing system, the throughput can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the throughput is equal to the average queue length divided by the average waiting time. However, due to the varying priority levels of customers, the throughput in the priority system may not be as straightforward to calculate as in other systems.

For example, customers with higher priority levels may have a shorter average waiting time, resulting in a higher throughput for these customers. On the other hand, customers with lower priority levels may have a longer average waiting time, resulting in a lower throughput for these customers. Therefore, the overall throughput in the priority system may be affected by the mix of customers with different priority levels.

Another important performance measure is the fairness index, which measures the fairness of the system in serving customers. In the priority queueing system, the fairness index can be calculated using the concept of virtual time, as discussed in the previous chapter. The fairness index is defined as the ratio of the virtual time advanced for high-priority customers to the virtual time advanced for low-priority customers. A fairness index of 1 indicates perfect fairness, where high-priority customers are served as soon as possible without causing delays for low-priority customers. A fairness index greater than 1 indicates that high-priority customers are being served faster than low-priority customers, resulting in potential delays for low-priority customers.

In addition to these performance measures, other factors such as system utilization, response time, and customer satisfaction can also be important in evaluating the performance of a priority queueing system. These factors may not have a straightforward relationship with the performance measures discussed above, and may require further analysis and consideration.

In the next section, we will explore how these performance measures can be used to evaluate the performance of a priority queueing system in different scenarios. We will also discuss how these measures can be used to make decisions about system design and resource allocation.

#### 6.3c Applications of Priority Queueing System

The priority queueing system has a wide range of applications in various fields, including computer science, telecommunications, and healthcare. In this section, we will explore some of these applications and how the performance measures discussed in the previous section can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the system in these applications.

One of the most common applications of the priority queueing system is in computer science, particularly in the design of algorithms and data structures. For example, the priority queue data structure is used in the selection sort algorithm, which sorts a collection of elements by repeatedly finding and removing the smallest element from the collection. The performance of this algorithm can be evaluated using the performance measures discussed in the previous section, such as the average queue length, average waiting time, and throughput.

In telecommunications, the priority queueing system is used to manage the flow of calls in a call center. Customers with higher priority levels, such as emergency calls, are served before customers with lower priority levels. The performance of the system can be evaluated using the fairness index, which measures the fairness of the system in serving customers. A high fairness index indicates that high-priority customers are being served as soon as possible without causing delays for low-priority customers.

In healthcare, the priority queueing system is used to manage patient flow in hospitals and clinics. Patients with higher priority levels, such as those with life-threatening conditions, are served before patients with lower priority levels. The performance of the system can be evaluated using the average queue length, average waiting time, and throughput. These measures can help identify bottlenecks in the system and inform decisions about resource allocation.

In conclusion, the priority queueing system is a powerful tool for managing the flow of customers in various applications. By understanding and evaluating the performance measures of the system, we can make informed decisions about system design and resource allocation, leading to improved efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## Chapter: Chapter 7: Systems with Overtaking: Approximations

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamentals of queueing theory, focusing on systems without overtaking. However, in many real-world scenarios, overtaking is a common occurrence. This chapter, "Systems with Overtaking: Approximations," delves into the complexities of queueing systems that allow for overtaking. 

Overtaking, in queueing theory, refers to the ability of a customer to overtake another customer in the queue. This can occur in various scenarios, such as in a single-server system where customers can jump the queue if they are willing to pay a premium, or in a multi-server system where customers can switch between queues. 

In this chapter, we will explore the mathematical models that describe these systems, and the approximations that can be used to simplify these models. These approximations are often necessary to make the models tractable, as the exact solutions can be complex and difficult to interpret. 

We will also discuss the assumptions and limitations of these approximations, and how they can affect the accuracy of the results. This will involve a careful balance between simplicity and accuracy, as we strive to understand the behavior of these complex systems.

#### 6.4a Definition and Analysis of Round Robin Queueing System

The round robin queueing system is a type of fair queuing algorithm that emulates the fairness of bitwise round-robin sharing of link resources among competing flows. In this system, packets are transmitted packetwise and in sequence, with the packet with the earliest finish time according to a modeling of the finish time being selected for transmission. This system is particularly useful in situations where there are multiple queues or flows competing for limited resources.

The complexity of the round robin queueing system is "O(log(n))", where "n" is the number of queues/flows. This complexity is necessary to accurately model the finish time for each packet and select the next packet for transmission. However, to reduce computational load, the concept of "virtual time" is introduced. Finish time for each packet is computed on this alternate monotonically increasing virtual timescale, and the packet with the earliest finish time on this virtual timescale is selected for transmission.

The virtual finish time for a newly queued packet is given by the sum of the virtual start time plus the packet's size. The virtual start time is the maximum between the previous virtual finish time of the same queue and the current instant. This allows for the accurate modeling of the order in which transmissions must occur to meet the objectives of the full-featured model, without the need to recompute the finish time for previously queued packets.

The fairness index in the round robin queueing system can be calculated using the concept of virtual time. The fairness index is defined as the ratio of the virtual time advanced for high-priority customers to the virtual time advanced for low-priority customers. A fairness index of 1 indicates perfect fairness, where high-priority customers are served as soon as possible without causing delays for low-priority customers. A fairness index greater than 1 indicates that high-priority customers are being served faster than low-priority customers, resulting in potential delays for low-priority customers.

In the next section, we will explore the performance measures of the round robin queueing system in more detail, including the average queue length, average waiting time, and throughput. We will also discuss the impact of the fairness index on the overall performance of the system.

#### 6.4b Performance Measures in Round Robin Queueing System

The performance of the round robin queueing system can be evaluated using various performance measures. These measures provide insights into the system's efficiency, fairness, and overall performance. In this section, we will discuss some of the key performance measures for the round robin queueing system.

##### Average Queue Length

The average queue length is a measure of the number of packets waiting in the queue for transmission. It is a crucial measure of the system's efficiency, as it indicates the amount of delay experienced by packets in the queue. The average queue length can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average queue length is equal to the average waiting time multiplied by the arrival rate of packets.

In the round robin queueing system, the average queue length can be calculated as follows:

$$
L = \frac{\lambda}{\mu - \lambda}
$$

where $L$ is the average queue length, $\lambda$ is the arrival rate of packets, and $\mu$ is the service rate of the system.

##### Average Waiting Time

The average waiting time is another important measure of the system's efficiency. It indicates the amount of time a packet spends waiting in the queue before it is transmitted. The average waiting time can be calculated using Little's Law, as mentioned earlier.

In the round robin queueing system, the average waiting time can be calculated as follows:

$$
W = \frac{L}{\lambda}
$$

where $W$ is the average waiting time, $L$ is the average queue length, and $\lambda$ is the arrival rate of packets.

##### Throughput

The throughput is a measure of the system's capacity, indicating the maximum rate at which packets can be transmitted. It is a crucial measure of the system's efficiency, as it indicates the system's ability to handle the arrival rate of packets.

In the round robin queueing system, the throughput can be calculated as follows:

$$
X = \lambda(1 - P_0)
$$

where $X$ is the throughput, $\lambda$ is the arrival rate of packets, and $P_0$ is the probability that there are no packets in the queue.

##### Fairness Index

The fairness index is a measure of the system's fairness in serving packets. It is defined as the ratio of the virtual time advanced for high-priority customers to the virtual time advanced for low-priority customers. A fairness index of 1 indicates perfect fairness, where high-priority customers are served as soon as possible without causing delays for low-priority customers. A fairness index greater than 1 indicates that high-priority customers are being served faster than low-priority customers, resulting in potential delays for low-priority customers.

In the round robin queueing system, the fairness index can be calculated as follows:

$$
F = \frac{V_{high}}{V_{low}}
$$

where $F$ is the fairness index, $V_{high}$ is the virtual time advanced for high-priority customers, and $V_{low}$ is the virtual time advanced for low-priority customers.

In the next section, we will discuss the impact of these performance measures on the overall performance of the round robin queueing system.

#### 6.4c Modeling Round Robin Queueing System

The round robin queueing system can be modeled using a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC). This model is particularly useful for analyzing the system's performance and predicting its behavior under different conditions.

##### State Space

The state space of the DTMC model for the round robin queueing system is defined by the number of packets in the queue and the priority level of the current packet being served. The state space can be represented as a two-dimensional array, where each element represents a state of the system.

The number of states in the state space is determined by the maximum number of packets that can be in the queue and the number of priority levels. For example, if the maximum number of packets in the queue is 10 and there are three priority levels, the state space would have 30 states.

##### Transition Probabilities

The transition probabilities of the DTMC model represent the probability of moving from one state to another in one time step. These probabilities are determined by the arrival rate of packets, the service rate of the system, and the fairness index of the system.

The arrival rate of packets determines the probability of entering a state. The service rate of the system determines the probability of leaving a state. The fairness index of the system determines the probability of transitioning between states of different priority levels.

##### Performance Measures

The performance measures of the round robin queueing system can be calculated from the DTMC model. The average queue length, average waiting time, and throughput can be calculated using Little's Law, as discussed in the previous section. The fairness index can be calculated using the virtual time advanced for high-priority and low-priority customers, as discussed in the previous section.

The DTMC model can also be used to analyze the system's behavior under different conditions. For example, the model can be used to determine the impact of changes in the arrival rate of packets, the service rate of the system, or the fairness index on the system's performance.

In the next section, we will discuss how to use the DTMC model to analyze the round robin queueing system in more detail.

## Chapter: Chapter 7: Systems with Overtaking: Approximations

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamentals of queueing theory, delving into the intricacies of queueing systems without overtaking. However, in real-world scenarios, overtaking is a common occurrence, and it is essential to understand how it affects the performance of queueing systems. This chapter, "Systems with Overtaking: Approximations," aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive understanding of queueing systems with overtaking, using approximations to simplify complex mathematical models.

Queueing systems with overtaking are characterized by the ability of queued packets to overtake each other, altering the order in which they were originally queued. This phenomenon introduces additional complexity into the queueing model, making it more challenging to analyze and optimize. However, by using approximations, we can simplify these models and gain valuable insights into the behavior of these systems.

In this chapter, we will explore various approximation techniques, such as the mean value analysis and the central limit theorem, and how they can be applied to queueing systems with overtaking. We will also discuss the limitations and trade-offs associated with these approximations, providing a balanced understanding of their applicability and effectiveness.

While approximations are not exact solutions, they provide a practical and efficient way to analyze queueing systems with overtaking. They allow us to gain insights into the system's behavior without having to solve complex mathematical models. However, it is crucial to understand the assumptions and limitations of these approximations to avoid misinterpretation of the results.

This chapter will provide a solid foundation for understanding and analyzing queueing systems with overtaking, equipping readers with the necessary tools and knowledge to tackle real-world queueing problems. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional in the field, this chapter will serve as a valuable resource in your journey to master queueing theory.




#### 6.4b Performance Measures in Round Robin Queueing System

The performance of the round robin queueing system can be evaluated using several key performance measures. These measures provide insights into the system's efficiency, fairness, and overall performance.

##### Average Waiting Time

The average waiting time is a measure of the time a packet spends waiting in the queue before being transmitted. It is a critical measure of the system's efficiency. The average waiting time can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average number of packets in the system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average waiting time. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

where $L$ is the average number of packets in the system, $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate, and $W$ is the average waiting time.

##### Fairness Index

As mentioned earlier, the fairness index is a measure of the fairness of the system. It is defined as the ratio of the virtual time advanced for high-priority customers to the virtual time advanced for low-priority customers. A fairness index of 1 indicates perfect fairness, where high-priority customers are served as soon as possible without causing delays for low-priority customers. A fairness index greater than 1 indicates that high-priority customers are being served faster than low-priority customers.

##### Throughput

The throughput is a measure of the system's capacity, representing the average number of packets that can be transmitted per unit time. It is a measure of the system's ability to handle traffic. The throughput can be calculated using the Little's Law formula:

$$
X = \lambda (1 - P)
$$

where $X$ is the throughput, $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate, and $P$ is the probability of packet loss.

##### Packet Loss

Packet loss is a measure of the system's reliability. It is the probability that a packet will be lost before being transmitted. Packet loss can occur due to buffer overflows or other system conditions. The packet loss probability $P$ can be calculated using the Little's Law formula:

$$
P = 1 - \frac{L}{\lambda W}
$$

where $L$ is the average number of packets in the system, $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate, and $W$ is the average waiting time.

In the next section, we will discuss how these performance measures can be used to analyze the round robin queueing system and make improvements to its performance.

In computer systems, the round robin queueing system is used to allocate processing time among different processes. This is particularly useful in multi-tasking operating systems, where multiple processes need to share the processor. The round robin queueing system ensures that each process gets a fair share of the processor time, preventing any process from hogging the processor.

##### Telecommunication Networks

In telecommunication networks, the round robin queueing system is used to allocate channel time among different users.

## Chapter: Chapter 7: Systems with Overtaking: Approximations

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored various aspects of queueing theory, from its fundamental concepts to advanced applications. We have delved into the intricacies of queueing systems, understanding their behavior, and predicting their performance. However, in real-world scenarios, queueing systems often exhibit complex behaviors that are difficult to model accurately. This is where approximations come into play.

In this chapter, we will delve into the world of approximations in queueing theory. We will explore how approximations can be used to simplify complex queueing systems, making them more manageable and easier to analyze. We will also discuss the trade-offs involved in using approximations, and how to choose the most appropriate approximation for a given queueing system.

We will begin by introducing the concept of overtaking in queueing systems. Overtaking occurs when a packet or a job overtakes another packet or job in the queue, leading to a change in the order of service. This phenomenon is common in many queueing systems, and it adds a layer of complexity to the system's behavior. We will discuss how overtaking can be modeled and analyzed, and how approximations can be used to simplify the model.

Next, we will delve into the various types of approximations used in queueing theory. These include the Markov approximation, the Little's Law approximation, and the Gordon-Newell approximation, among others. We will discuss the principles behind these approximations, their assumptions, and their limitations. We will also explore how these approximations can be used to analyze queueing systems with overtaking.

Finally, we will discuss the trade-offs involved in using approximations. While approximations can simplify complex queueing systems, they also introduce errors and uncertainties. We will discuss how to balance these trade-offs, and how to choose the most appropriate approximation for a given queueing system.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of approximations in queueing theory, and you will be equipped with the knowledge and tools to analyze queueing systems with overtaking using approximations. This chapter will serve as a stepping stone to more advanced topics in queueing theory, where we will continue to explore the fascinating world of queueing systems.

Queueing theory is a mathematical discipline that deals with the study of waiting lines and the behavior of systems where there are multiple users competing for a limited set of resources. It has a wide range of applications in various fields such as telecommunications, computer science, and transportation.

The concept of systems with no overtaking refers to queueing systems where the order in which customers are served does not affect the system's behavior. This is a fundamental concept in queueing theory, as it simplifies the analysis of many real-world systems. We will explore the mathematical models and techniques used to analyze these systems, and how they can be applied to various real-world scenarios.

Asymptotic solutions, on the other hand, are mathematical approximations that are used to describe the long-term behavior of queueing systems. These solutions are particularly useful in systems with no overtaking, where the system's behavior can be described by a set of equations that are often difficult to solve exactly. We will discuss the principles behind asymptotic solutions and how they can be used to analyze queueing systems.

Throughout this chapter, we will use the popular Markdown format to present the material, with math equations rendered using the MathJax library. This will allow us to present complex mathematical concepts in a clear and concise manner. We will also provide examples and applications to illustrate the concepts discussed, and to show how they can be used to solve real-world problems.

In summary, this chapter will provide a comprehensive introduction to systems with no overtaking and their asymptotic solutions in queueing theory. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of these concepts and be able to apply them to analyze and optimize queueing systems in various fields.




### Subsection: 7.1a Definition and Analysis of Long-Run Average Queue Length

The long-run average queue length is a fundamental concept in queueing theory that describes the average number of customers waiting in the queue over a long period of time. It is a key performance measure for queueing systems, as it provides insight into the system's stability and efficiency.

#### Definition of Long-Run Average Queue Length

The long-run average queue length, denoted as $L$, is defined as the average number of customers waiting in the queue over a long period of time. It is typically calculated as the ratio of the long-run average queue length to the long-run average arrival rate, denoted as $\lambda$. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
L = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the long-run average arrival rate and $\mu$ is the long-run average service rate.

#### Analysis of Long-Run Average Queue Length

The long-run average queue length can be analyzed using various techniques, including the Erlang-C formula and the Erlang-B formula. These formulas provide closed-form solutions for the long-run average queue length in systems with no overtaking.

The Erlang-C formula is used for systems with a single server and no overtaking, and it is given by:

$$
L = \frac{\lambda}{\mu (1 - \frac{\lambda}{\mu})}
$$

The Erlang-B formula, on the other hand, is used for systems with multiple servers and no overtaking, and it is given by:

$$
L = \frac{\lambda}{\mu (1 - (\frac{\lambda}{\mu})^k) \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \frac{(\lambda/\mu)^i}{i!})}
$$

where $k$ is the number of servers.

These formulas can be used to calculate the long-run average queue length for different system configurations and arrival rates. They can also be used to analyze the impact of changes in the system parameters on the long-run average queue length.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of the long-run average queue length in the context of systems with no overtaking and asymptotic solutions. We will also explore how these concepts can be applied to analyze real-world queueing systems.




#### 7.1b Estimating Long-Run Average Queue Length in Queueing Systems

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of long-run average queue length and its importance in queueing theory. In this section, we will delve into the methods of estimating the long-run average queue length in queueing systems.

##### Buzen's Algorithm

Buzen's algorithm is a powerful tool for estimating the long-run average queue length in queueing systems. It is particularly useful in systems with multiple service facilities and circulating customers. The algorithm is based on the Gordon-Newell theorem, which provides a compact representation of the steady-state probabilities of the number of customers at each service facility.

The algorithm involves solving a set of equations to determine the values of $X_i$, which represent the steady-state probabilities of the number of customers at each service facility. These values are then used to calculate the long-run average queue length.

The algorithm is particularly efficient for large systems, making it a valuable tool for estimating the long-run average queue length in complex queueing systems.

##### Little's Law

Little's Law is another method for estimating the long-run average queue length. It is based on the fundamental relationship between the average queue length, the average arrival rate, and the average service rate.

The law states that the long-run average queue length is equal to the product of the average arrival rate and the average time a customer spends in the system. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
L = \lambda \cdot E[T]
$$

where $L$ is the long-run average queue length, $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate, and $E[T]$ is the average time a customer spends in the system.

This law provides a simple and intuitive method for estimating the long-run average queue length. However, it assumes that the system is in a steady state, which may not always be the case in real-world queueing systems.

##### Erlang-C and Erlang-B Formulas

The Erlang-C and Erlang-B formulas are two more methods for estimating the long-run average queue length. These formulas are particularly useful for systems with a single server and no overtaking, and systems with multiple servers and no overtaking, respectively.

The Erlang-C formula is given by:

$$
L = \frac{\lambda}{\mu (1 - \frac{\lambda}{\mu})}
$$

and the Erlang-B formula is given by:

$$
L = \frac{\lambda}{\mu (1 - (\frac{\lambda}{\mu})^k) \sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \frac{(\lambda/\mu)^i}{i!})}
$$

where $L$ is the long-run average queue length, $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate, $\mu$ is the average service rate, and $k$ is the number of servers.

These formulas provide closed-form solutions for the long-run average queue length, making them easy to use. However, they assume that the system is in a steady state and that the service time distribution follows an exponential distribution, which may not always be the case in real-world queueing systems.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of the long-run average queue length in the context of systems with no overtaking and asymptotic solutions.




#### 7.2a Definition and Analysis of Long-Run Average Waiting Time

The long-run average waiting time is a crucial concept in queueing theory, particularly in systems where overtaking is not allowed. It is a measure of the average time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. In this section, we will define and analyze the long-run average waiting time in queueing systems.

##### Definition of Long-Run Average Waiting Time

The long-run average waiting time, denoted as $W$, is defined as the average time a customer spends waiting in the queue before being served. It is a measure of the system's efficiency, as a longer waiting time indicates a less efficient system.

The long-run average waiting time can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the long-run average waiting time is equal to the ratio of the long-run average queue length and the average arrival rate. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
W = \frac{L}{\lambda}
$$

where $W$ is the long-run average waiting time, $L$ is the long-run average queue length, and $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate.

##### Analysis of Long-Run Average Waiting Time

The long-run average waiting time can be analyzed using various methods, including Buzen's algorithm and Little's Law. These methods provide a way to estimate the long-run average waiting time in queueing systems.

Buzen's algorithm, as discussed in the previous section, is particularly useful in systems with multiple service facilities and circulating customers. It provides a way to estimate the long-run average waiting time by solving a set of equations based on the Gordon-Newell theorem.

Little's Law, on the other hand, provides a simple and intuitive method for estimating the long-run average waiting time. It is based on the fundamental relationship between the average queue length, the average arrival rate, and the average service rate.

In the next section, we will delve into the methods of reducing the long-run average waiting time in queueing systems.

#### 7.2b Estimating Long-Run Average Waiting Time in Queueing Systems

$$
W = \frac{L}{\lambda}
$$

where $W$ is the long-run average waiting time, $L$ is the long-run average queue length, and $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate.

##### Reducing Long-Run Average Waiting Time

Reducing the long-run average waiting time is crucial in improving the efficiency of queueing systems. This can be achieved by increasing the average arrival rate or decreasing the average queue length.

Increasing the average arrival rate can be achieved by adding more service facilities or increasing the service rate. However, this may not always be feasible due to resource constraints.

Decreasing the average queue length, on the other hand, can be achieved by optimizing the service process or implementing queue discipline strategies. For example, implementing a first-come-first-served (FCFS) queue discipline can help reduce the average queue length.

In the next section, we will discuss how to model and analyze queueing systems with multiple service facilities and circulating customers.

#### 7.2c Case Studies of Long-Run Average Waiting Time in Queueing Systems

In this section, we will explore some case studies that illustrate the application of the concepts discussed in the previous sections. These case studies will provide a practical understanding of how the long-run average waiting time is estimated and reduced in queueing systems.

##### Case Study 1: Buzen's Algorithm in a Telecommunication Network

Consider a telecommunication network with multiple service facilities and circulating customers. The network experiences a high volume of traffic, and the long-run average waiting time needs to be estimated to improve the network's efficiency.

Buzen's algorithm can be used to solve a set of equations based on the Gordon-Newell theorem to estimate the long-run average waiting time. The algorithm can be implemented using the `qnsim` package in R, as discussed in the previous context.

The algorithm can be used to estimate the long-run average waiting time for different scenarios, such as varying the number of service facilities or the arrival rate of customers. This can help identify the most effective strategies for reducing the long-run average waiting time.

##### Case Study 2: Little's Law in a Call Center

Little's Law can be used to estimate the long-run average waiting time. The average queue length can be calculated using the `qnsim` package in R, and the average arrival rate can be estimated from the call center's historical data.

The long-run average waiting time can be reduced by increasing the average arrival rate or decreasing the average queue length. This can be achieved by adding more service facilities or implementing queue discipline strategies, such as prioritizing urgent calls.

##### Case Study 3: Reducing Long-Run Average Waiting Time in a Hospital

A hospital experiences long waiting times for patients, and the long-run average waiting time needs to be reduced to improve the hospital's efficiency.

Buzen's algorithm and Little's Law can be used to estimate the long-run average waiting time and identify the most effective strategies for reducing it. This can involve increasing the number of service facilities or implementing queue discipline strategies, such as prioritizing urgent patients.

In addition, the hospital can also implement process optimization strategies, such as streamlining the patient flow or improving the efficiency of the service process. This can help reduce the average queue length and, consequently, the long-run average waiting time.

In conclusion, these case studies illustrate how the concepts of Buzen's algorithm and Little's Law can be applied to estimate and reduce the long-run average waiting time in queueing systems. By understanding these concepts and implementing them effectively, queueing systems can be optimized to improve their efficiency.

#### 7.3a Definition and Analysis of Asymptotic Behavior in Queueing Systems

As we have seen in the previous sections, the long-run average waiting time is a crucial metric in queueing theory. It provides a measure of the system's performance over time, and it is particularly useful in systems with no overtaking. However, the long-run average waiting time is not always easy to calculate, especially in complex systems. This is where the concept of asymptotic behavior comes into play.

##### Asymptotic Behavior

Asymptotic behavior refers to the long-term behavior of a system as time approaches infinity. In queueing theory, we are often interested in the asymptotic behavior of the system's performance metrics, such as the long-run average waiting time.

##### Asymptotic Solutions

Asymptotic solutions are mathematical techniques used to approximate the long-term behavior of a system. These solutions are particularly useful in queueing theory, where the exact solutions can be difficult to obtain.

One of the most common methods for obtaining asymptotic solutions is the method of moments. This method involves equating the moments of the system's performance metrics with the moments of the approximating distribution. The resulting equations can then be solved to obtain the parameters of the approximating distribution.

Another method for obtaining asymptotic solutions is the method of steepest descent. This method involves finding the minimum of the system's performance metrics by varying the system's parameters. The resulting equations can then be solved to obtain the optimal values of the system's parameters.

##### Asymptotic Behavior of the Long-Run Average Waiting Time

The long-run average waiting time is a crucial performance metric in queueing systems. Its asymptotic behavior can be approximated using various methods, such as the method of moments and the method of steepest descent. These approximations can provide valuable insights into the system's performance and can help in making decisions to improve the system's performance.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the method of moments and the method of steepest descent and discuss how they can be used to approximate the asymptotic behavior of the long-run average waiting time in queueing systems.

#### 7.3b Analysis of Asymptotic Behavior in Queueing Systems

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of asymptotic behavior and discussed how it can be used to approximate the long-term behavior of a system. In this section, we will delve deeper into the analysis of asymptotic behavior in queueing systems.

##### Asymptotic Efficiency

Asymptotic efficiency is a measure of the accuracy of an approximating distribution. It is defined as the ratio of the variance of the approximating distribution to the variance of the exact distribution. The closer the asymptotic efficiency is to 1, the more accurate the approximating distribution is.

In queueing theory, the method of moments and the method of steepest descent are often used to obtain asymptotic solutions. These methods can provide accurate approximations of the system's performance metrics, but their asymptotic efficiencies can vary. For example, the method of moments can have an asymptotic efficiency of 0.95, while the method of steepest descent can have an asymptotic efficiency of 0.99.

##### Asymptotic Variance

Asymptotic variance is a measure of the dispersion of the approximating distribution. It is defined as the variance of the approximating distribution divided by the variance of the exact distribution. The smaller the asymptotic variance is, the more concentrated the approximating distribution is around the mean.

In queueing theory, the method of moments and the method of steepest descent can also provide estimates of the asymptotic variance. These estimates can be used to assess the accuracy of the approximating distribution. For example, if the estimated asymptotic variance is small, it indicates that the approximating distribution is concentrated around the mean and is therefore accurate.

##### Asymptotic Bias

Asymptotic bias is a measure of the systematic error in the approximating distribution. It is defined as the difference between the mean of the approximating distribution and the mean of the exact distribution. The smaller the asymptotic bias is, the less systematic error there is in the approximating distribution.

In queueing theory, the method of moments and the method of steepest descent can also provide estimates of the asymptotic bias. These estimates can be used to assess the accuracy of the approximating distribution. For example, if the estimated asymptotic bias is small, it indicates that the approximating distribution is close to the exact distribution and is therefore accurate.

##### Asymptotic Behavior of the Long-Run Average Waiting Time

The long-run average waiting time is a crucial performance metric in queueing systems. Its asymptotic behavior can be approximated using various methods, such as the method of moments and the method of steepest descent. These methods can provide accurate approximations of the long-run average waiting time, but their asymptotic efficiencies, variances, and biases can vary. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the choice of method and the interpretation of the results when analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the long-run average waiting time in queueing systems.

#### 7.3c Applications of Asymptotic Behavior in Queueing Systems

In this section, we will explore some of the applications of asymptotic behavior in queueing systems. The concepts of asymptotic efficiency, variance, and bias, as well as the methods of moments and steepest descent, can be applied to a variety of queueing systems to analyze their performance.

##### Application 1: Network Traffic Analysis

In network traffic analysis, queueing theory is used to model the flow of data packets through a network. The long-run average waiting time is a crucial metric in this context, as it represents the average delay experienced by a data packet in the network. By applying the methods of moments and steepest descent, we can obtain asymptotic solutions for the long-run average waiting time, which can provide valuable insights into the network's performance.

For example, if the estimated asymptotic variance is small, it indicates that the approximating distribution is concentrated around the mean, which suggests that the network's performance is stable and predictable. On the other hand, a large estimated asymptotic variance may indicate that the network's performance is highly variable, which could suggest the need for network optimization or redesign.

##### Application 2: Telecommunication Systems

In telecommunication systems, queueing theory is used to model the queues of incoming calls. The long-run average waiting time is a key metric in this context, as it represents the average delay experienced by a caller before being connected to a service. By applying the methods of moments and steepest descent, we can obtain asymptotic solutions for the long-run average waiting time, which can provide valuable insights into the system's performance.

For example, if the estimated asymptotic bias is small, it indicates that the approximating distribution is close to the exact distribution, which suggests that the system's performance is accurate and reliable. On the other hand, a large estimated asymptotic bias may indicate that the system's performance is systematically over or underestimated, which could suggest the need for system optimization or redesign.

##### Application 3: Manufacturing Systems

In manufacturing systems, queueing theory is used to model the queues of jobs waiting for processing. The long-run average waiting time is a crucial metric in this context, as it represents the average delay experienced by a job before being processed. By applying the methods of moments and steepest descent, we can obtain asymptotic solutions for the long-run average waiting time, which can provide valuable insights into the system's performance.

For example, if the estimated asymptotic efficiency is high, it indicates that the approximating distribution is accurate, which suggests that the system's performance is reliable and predictable. On the other hand, a low estimated asymptotic efficiency may indicate that the system's performance is inaccurate, which could suggest the need for system optimization or redesign.

In conclusion, the concepts of asymptotic behavior and the methods of moments and steepest descent are powerful tools in queueing theory, with a wide range of applications in various fields. By understanding and applying these concepts, we can gain valuable insights into the performance of queueing systems, which can help us optimize and improve these systems.

#### 7.3b Understanding the Limiting Behavior of Queueing Systems

The limiting behavior of a queueing system refers to its long-term behavior as time approaches infinity. This behavior is particularly important in queueing theory as it provides insights into the system's performance and stability.

##### Limiting Behavior

The limiting behavior of a queueing system is determined by its long-run average waiting time. As we have seen in the previous sections, the long-run average waiting time is a crucial metric in queueing theory. It provides a measure of the system's performance over time, and it is particularly useful in systems with no overtaking.

#### 7.3c Case Studies of Asymptotic Behavior in Queueing Systems

In this section, we will explore some case studies that illustrate the application of asymptotic solutions in queueing systems. These case studies will provide a practical understanding of the concepts discussed in the previous sections.

##### Case Study 1: Buzen's Algorithm

Buzen's algorithm is a method used to compute the normalizing constant "G"("N") in the Gordon–Newell theorem. This algorithm is particularly useful in queueing systems with multiple service facilities and circulating customers.

Consider a closed queueing network with "M" service facilities and "N" circulating customers. The service time for a customer at service facility "i" is given by an exponentially distributed random variable with parameter "μ"<sub>"i"</sub>, and after completing service at service facility "i", a customer will proceed next to service facility "j" with probability "p"<sub>"ij"</sub>.

The steady state probability that the number of customers at service facility "i" is equal to "n<sub>i</sub>" for "i" = 1, 2, ... , "M" is given by

$$
\mathbb P(n_1,n_2,\cdots,n_M) = \frac{1}{\text{G}(N)}\prod_{i=1}^M \left( X_i \right)^{n_i}
$$

The values of "X"<sub>"i"</sub> are determined by solving

$$
\mu_j X_j = \sum_{i=1}^M \mu_i X_i p_{ij}\quad\text{ for }j=1,\ldots,M.
$$

Buzen's algorithm represents the first efficient procedure for computing "G"("N"). This algorithm can be used to approximate the long-run average waiting time in queueing systems, providing valuable insights into the system's performance and stability.

##### Case Study 2: Fork–Join Queue Networks

Fork–join queue networks are a type of queueing system where a job is split into "N" sub-tasks which are serviced in parallel. The response time distribution for a network of fork–join queues joined in series can be calculated using an approximate formula.

This formula can be used to approximate the long-run average waiting time in fork–join queue networks, providing valuable insights into the system's performance and stability.

##### Case Study 3: Split–Merge Model

The split–merge model is a related model to the fork–join queue. In this model, a job is split into "N" sub-tasks which are serviced in parallel. Only when all the tasks finish servicing and have rejoined can the next job start. This leads to a slower response time compared to the fork–join queue.

The exact results for the split-merge queue are given by Fiorini and Lipsky. This model can be used to approximate the long-run average waiting time in queueing systems, providing valuable insights into the system's performance and stability.

In the next section, we will explore some advanced applications of queueing theory, building on the concepts and case studies discussed in this chapter.

We have learned that these systems are characterized by the absence of overtaking, a feature that simplifies the analysis of queueing systems. We have also seen how these systems can be used to model real-world scenarios, such as traffic flow and telecommunication networks.

We have also discussed the concept of asymptotic solutions in queueing systems. These solutions provide a way to approximate the behavior of queueing systems as the system size approaches infinity. This is particularly useful in systems where exact solutions are difficult to obtain.

In conclusion, queueing systems with no overtaking and their asymptotic solutions provide a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing a wide range of real-world systems.

## Chapter: Chapter 8: Systems with Overtaking: Asymptotic Solutions

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamentals of queueing theory, delving into the intricacies of queueing systems without overtaking. However, in real-world scenarios, overtaking is a common occurrence in queueing systems. This chapter, "Systems with Overtaking: Asymptotic Solutions," aims to bridge this gap by introducing the concept of overtaking in queueing systems and providing a comprehensive understanding of the asymptotic solutions associated with these systems.

Overtaking in queueing systems refers to the phenomenon where a queueing system allows for the possibility of a slower queue to overtake a faster queue. This can occur due to various reasons, such as changes in traffic patterns, system upgrades, or unexpected events. Understanding how these overtakings occur and their impact on the system is crucial for designing efficient queueing systems.

The chapter will also delve into the concept of asymptotic solutions in queueing systems with overtaking. Asymptotic solutions provide a simplified representation of the system's behavior as the system size approaches infinity. These solutions are particularly useful in queueing systems with overtaking, where the system's behavior can be complex and difficult to predict.

Throughout this chapter, we will use mathematical models and equations to describe the queueing systems and their behavior. For instance, we might use the Little's Law, represented as `$\lambda = \mu X$`, where `$\lambda$` is the arrival rate, `$\mu$` is the service rate, and `$X$` is the queue length. We will also use the concept of traffic intensity, represented as `$\rho = \lambda/\mu$`, where `$\rho$` is the traffic intensity.

## Chapter 8: Systems with No Overtaking: Advanced Applications:




### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the world of priority and polling systems in queueing theory. These systems are essential in managing queues and ensuring efficient service delivery. Priority systems are used to give certain customers or tasks priority over others, while polling systems are used to allocate resources among a set of competing entities.

We will begin by discussing the fundamentals of priority systems, including the different types of priorities that can be assigned and the impact of these priorities on queueing behavior. We will also explore the mathematical models used to analyze priority systems, such as the M/G/s queue and the M/M/s queue.

Next, we will move on to polling systems, which are used to allocate resources among a set of competing entities. We will discuss the different types of polling systems, such as round-robin and weighted fair queuing, and their applications in various scenarios. We will also explore the mathematical models used to analyze polling systems, such as the M/G/s queue and the M/M/s queue.

Throughout this chapter, we will use the popular Markdown format to present the concepts and equations in a clear and concise manner. All mathematical expressions will be formatted using the $ and $$ delimiters to insert math expressions in TeX and LaTeX style syntax, rendered using the highly popular MathJax library. This will allow us to present complex mathematical concepts in a visually appealing and easy-to-understand manner.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of priority and polling systems and their applications in queueing theory. This knowledge will be essential for anyone working in the field of queueing theory, as these systems are widely used in various industries to manage queues and ensure efficient service delivery. So let's dive in and explore the world of priority and polling systems in queueing theory.




### Section: 8.1 Priority Queues:

Priority queues are an essential tool in queueing theory, allowing for the efficient management of queues by giving certain customers or tasks priority over others. In this section, we will explore the definition and analysis of priority queues, including the different types of priorities that can be assigned and the impact of these priorities on queueing behavior.

#### 8.1a Definition and Analysis of Priority Queues

A priority queue is a type of queue where customers or tasks are assigned a priority level, and those with higher priority are served before those with lower priority. This allows for the efficient management of queues, as certain customers or tasks can be given priority over others.

The priority level can be assigned in various ways, such as based on customer type, task urgency, or customer arrival time. For example, in a hospital setting, patients with life-threatening conditions may be given higher priority over those with less urgent needs. In a computer system, tasks with higher urgency or shorter processing time may be given higher priority.

The impact of priorities on queueing behavior can be analyzed using mathematical models, such as the M/G/s queue and the M/M/s queue. These models allow us to determine the average queue length, waiting time, and other performance measures for different priority schemes.

In the M/G/s queue, customers arrive at a single queue and are served by a single server. The service time distribution follows a general distribution, and the priority scheme is determined by the arrival order of customers. This model is useful for analyzing the impact of different priority schemes on queueing behavior.

In the M/M/s queue, customers arrive at a single queue and are served by s servers. The service time distribution follows an exponential distribution, and the priority scheme is determined by the arrival order of customers. This model is useful for analyzing the impact of different priority schemes on queueing behavior in a more simplified manner.

In addition to these mathematical models, there are also various algorithms that can be used to implement priority queues. These algorithms, such as the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) and LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) algorithms, determine the order in which customers are served based on their priority level.

In conclusion, priority queues are an important tool in queueing theory, allowing for the efficient management of queues by giving certain customers or tasks priority over others. By understanding the different types of priorities that can be assigned and the impact of these priorities on queueing behavior, we can effectively analyze and implement priority queues in various applications.





### Subsection: 8.1b Performance Evaluation of Priority Queues

In the previous section, we discussed the definition and analysis of priority queues. In this section, we will focus on the performance evaluation of priority queues, specifically in the context of the M/G/s queue.

The M/G/s queue is a mathematical model that allows us to analyze the performance of a priority queue. In this model, customers arrive at a single queue and are served by a single server. The service time distribution follows a general distribution, and the priority scheme is determined by the arrival order of customers.

To evaluate the performance of a priority queue in the M/G/s queue, we can use the Little's Law, which states that the average queue length is equal to the average waiting time multiplied by the average arrival rate. This law can be extended to include the impact of priorities, as shown in the equation below:

$$
L = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\lambda_i}{\mu_i}
$$

where $L$ is the average queue length, $\lambda_i$ is the arrival rate of customers with priority $i$, and $\mu_i$ is the service rate of customers with priority $i$.

This equation allows us to calculate the average queue length for each priority level, and then sum them to get the overall average queue length. By analyzing the impact of different priority schemes on the average queue length, we can determine the most efficient way to assign priorities in a queue.

In addition to the average queue length, we can also use Little's Law to calculate the average waiting time and the average arrival rate for each priority level. This allows us to further analyze the performance of the queue and make adjustments to improve its efficiency.

In conclusion, the M/G/s queue is a useful tool for evaluating the performance of priority queues. By using Little's Law and analyzing the impact of priorities on queueing behavior, we can determine the most efficient way to assign priorities and improve the overall performance of the queue. 


## Chapter 8: Priority, Polling Systems:




### Subsection: 8.2a Definition and Analysis of Preemptive Scheduling in Queueing Systems

Preemptive scheduling is a type of scheduling policy used in queueing systems where the scheduler has the authority to interrupt a running process and switch to another process. This allows for more efficient use of resources and can improve the overall performance of the system.

In the context of queueing theory, preemptive scheduling can be applied to both single-server and multi-server systems. In a single-server system, the scheduler can interrupt a job currently being served by the server and switch to a higher priority job. This allows for more efficient use of the server's time, as the higher priority job may have a shorter service time.

In a multi-server system, preemptive scheduling can be used to balance the workload across the servers. The scheduler can interrupt a job being served by one server and switch it to another server with more available resources. This can help reduce queueing delays and improve the overall performance of the system.

To analyze the performance of preemptive scheduling in queueing systems, we can use the concept of Little's Law, as discussed in the previous section. By considering the arrival rate and service rate of each priority level, we can determine the average queue length and waiting time for the system.

In addition to Little's Law, we can also use other performance metrics such as the average response time and the average number of jobs in the system. These metrics can help us evaluate the effectiveness of preemptive scheduling and make adjustments to improve the system's performance.

In the next section, we will discuss the implementation of preemptive scheduling in queueing systems and explore some real-world examples.





#### 8.2b Impact of Preemptive Scheduling on System Performance

Preemptive scheduling has a significant impact on the performance of queueing systems. By allowing the scheduler to interrupt and switch between processes, preemptive scheduling can improve the overall efficiency of the system.

One of the main benefits of preemptive scheduling is its ability to balance the workload across different processes. In a non-preemptive system, a process with a longer service time may monopolize the system's resources, leading to longer waiting times for other processes. However, with preemptive scheduling, the scheduler can interrupt the process and switch to a higher priority process, ensuring that all processes receive a fair share of the system's resources.

This can be particularly beneficial in systems with varying service times, where some processes may require more resources than others. By allowing the scheduler to interrupt and switch between processes, preemptive scheduling can help reduce queueing delays and improve the overall performance of the system.

Another advantage of preemptive scheduling is its ability to handle urgent or high-priority processes. In a non-preemptive system, a high-priority process may have to wait behind a lower priority process, leading to potential delays and inefficiencies. However, with preemptive scheduling, the scheduler can interrupt and switch to a high-priority process, ensuring that it receives immediate attention.

This can be particularly useful in systems where timely completion of certain processes is critical, such as in emergency situations or real-time systems. By prioritizing these processes, preemptive scheduling can help improve the overall reliability and dependability of the system.

However, preemptive scheduling also has some drawbacks that must be considered. One of the main challenges is the overhead associated with context switching. Each time the scheduler interrupts a process and switches to another, there is a cost in terms of processing power and memory usage. This can lead to increased overhead and potentially impact the system's performance.

Additionally, preemptive scheduling can also introduce fairness issues. In a non-preemptive system, processes are served in the order of their arrival, ensuring fairness. However, with preemptive scheduling, the scheduler has the power to interrupt and switch between processes, potentially leading to unfair treatment of certain processes.

Despite these challenges, preemptive scheduling remains a crucial tool in queueing theory, allowing for more efficient and effective management of resources in complex systems. By carefully considering the trade-offs and implementing appropriate algorithms, preemptive scheduling can greatly improve the performance of queueing systems.





#### 8.3a Definition and Analysis of Non-preemptive Scheduling in Queueing Systems

Non-preemptive scheduling is a type of scheduling policy used in queueing systems where the scheduler cannot interrupt and switch between processes. In this policy, once a process is assigned to a server, it must complete its service before another process can be served. This is in contrast to preemptive scheduling, where the scheduler can interrupt and switch between processes at any time.

Non-preemptive scheduling is often used in systems where the service time of each process is known in advance or where the overhead of context switching is too high. It is also commonly used in systems where fairness is a critical concern, as it ensures that each process receives a fair share of the system's resources.

The analysis of non-preemptive scheduling in queueing systems involves studying the behavior of the system under different scheduling policies. This includes determining the average waiting time, queue length, and throughput of the system. These metrics are crucial in evaluating the performance of the system and identifying potential areas for improvement.

One of the main challenges in analyzing non-preemptive scheduling is the lack of flexibility in process scheduling. This can lead to longer waiting times and queue lengths, especially in systems with varying service times. However, non-preemptive scheduling can still be an effective policy in certain scenarios, such as in systems with known service times or in systems where fairness is a critical concern.

In the next section, we will explore some of the common non-preemptive scheduling policies used in queueing systems and discuss their advantages and disadvantages.

#### 8.3b Advantages and Disadvantages of Non-preemptive Scheduling

Non-preemptive scheduling has its own set of advantages and disadvantages that make it suitable for certain types of queueing systems. Understanding these advantages and disadvantages is crucial in determining whether non-preemptive scheduling is the right choice for a particular system.

##### Advantages of Non-preemptive Scheduling

1. **Simplicity:** Non-preemptive scheduling is a simple and straightforward policy. It does not require complex algorithms or calculations, making it easier to implement and manage.

2. **Fairness:** Non-preemptive scheduling ensures that each process receives a fair share of the system's resources. This is particularly important in systems where fairness is a critical concern.

3. **Known Service Times:** Non-preemptive scheduling is often used in systems where the service time of each process is known in advance. This makes it easier to predict and manage the system's performance.

##### Disadvantages of Non-preemptive Scheduling

1. **Longer Waiting Times:** Non-preemptive scheduling can lead to longer waiting times and queue lengths, especially in systems with varying service times. This can result in poor system performance.

2. **Lack of Flexibility:** The lack of flexibility in process scheduling can limit the system's ability to respond to changes in workload or unexpected events.

3. **High Overhead:** The lack of flexibility in process scheduling can also lead to high overhead, as the scheduler cannot interrupt and switch between processes to optimize system performance.

In conclusion, non-preemptive scheduling is a simple and fair policy that is suitable for systems with known service times. However, it may not be the best choice for systems with varying service times or high workload variability. In the next section, we will explore some of the common non-preemptive scheduling policies used in queueing systems and discuss their advantages and disadvantages in more detail.

#### 8.3c Non-preemptive Scheduling in Real-World Scenarios

Non-preemptive scheduling is not just a theoretical concept, but it is also widely used in real-world scenarios. In this section, we will explore some of the common real-world applications of non-preemptive scheduling.

##### Manufacturing Industry

In the manufacturing industry, non-preemptive scheduling is often used to manage the production process. Each machine or process is assigned a fixed amount of time for processing a job. Once a job is assigned to a machine, it must complete its processing before another job can be assigned. This ensures that each job receives a fair share of the machine's resources, leading to a more efficient production process.

##### Telecommunication Networks

In telecommunication networks, non-preemptive scheduling is used to manage the allocation of resources among different users. Each user is assigned a fixed amount of time for using the network resources. This ensures that each user receives a fair share of the network's resources, preventing any single user from monopolizing the network.

##### Computer Systems

In computer systems, non-preemptive scheduling is used to manage the allocation of resources among different processes. Each process is assigned a fixed amount of time for using the system's resources. This ensures that each process receives a fair share of the system's resources, preventing any single process from monopolizing the system.

##### Traffic Control

In traffic control systems, non-preemptive scheduling is used to manage the allocation of road space among different vehicles. Each vehicle is assigned a fixed amount of time for using the road space. This ensures that each vehicle receives a fair share of the road space, preventing any single vehicle from monopolizing the road.

In conclusion, non-preemptive scheduling is a simple and effective policy that is widely used in various real-world scenarios. Its simplicity and fairness make it a popular choice for managing resource allocation in many systems. However, it is important to note that non-preemptive scheduling may not be suitable for all systems, especially those with varying service times or high workload variability. In such cases, other scheduling policies may be more appropriate.

By understanding the fundamentals and advanced applications of these systems, we can design more efficient and fair queueing systems.

### Exercises

#### Exercise 1
Consider a preemptive priority system with two types of jobs: type A and type B. Type A jobs have a higher priority than type B jobs. If a type A job is in the system, no type B job can be scheduled. If there are no type A jobs in the system, type B jobs are scheduled. The service time for type A jobs is exponentially distributed with mean 2 minutes, and the service time for type B jobs is exponentially distributed with mean 3 minutes. Calculate the average queue length for type A jobs.

## Chapter: Chapter 9: Advanced Topics in Queueing Theory

### Introduction

Queueing theory, a mathematical discipline, is a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing systems where customers or jobs arrive, wait in a queue, and are eventually served. This chapter, "Advanced Topics in Queueing Theory," delves deeper into the intricacies of queueing theory, building upon the fundamental concepts and principles introduced in the previous chapters.

The chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of advanced topics in queueing theory, including but not limited to, multi-server queues, finite-capacity queues, and queueing networks. These topics are crucial for understanding and analyzing complex systems where multiple servers are involved, where the queue capacity is finite, and where multiple queues interact with each other.

We will explore the mathematical models and techniques used to analyze these advanced topics. This includes the use of Markov chains, generating functions, and the concept of traffic. These tools will be illustrated with examples and applications, providing a practical understanding of how queueing theory can be used to solve real-world problems.

The chapter also introduces the concept of queueing networks, which are systems of interconnected queues. We will discuss the different types of queueing networks, such as series, parallel, and split-merge networks, and how to analyze them using queueing theory.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of advanced topics in queueing theory, and be able to apply this knowledge to analyze and optimize complex queueing systems. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional, this chapter will provide you with the tools and knowledge to tackle advanced queueing problems.




#### 8.3b Evaluating the Effectiveness of Non-preemptive Scheduling

Non-preemptive scheduling, while simple in concept, can be challenging to evaluate in terms of its effectiveness. The lack of flexibility in process scheduling can lead to longer waiting times and queue lengths, especially in systems with varying service times. However, non-preemptive scheduling can still be an effective policy in certain scenarios, such as in systems with known service times or in systems where fairness is a critical concern.

One way to evaluate the effectiveness of non-preemptive scheduling is by studying its impact on the average waiting time, queue length, and throughput of the system. These metrics can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average queue length is equal to the average waiting time multiplied by the average arrival rate. By minimizing the average waiting time and queue length, non-preemptive scheduling can improve the throughput of the system.

Another way to evaluate the effectiveness of non-preemptive scheduling is by studying its impact on fairness. Non-preemptive scheduling ensures that each process receives a fair share of the system's resources, as it cannot be interrupted or preempted by other processes. This can be particularly beneficial in systems where fairness is a critical concern, such as in real-time systems or systems with multiple users.

However, non-preemptive scheduling also has its disadvantages. The lack of flexibility in process scheduling can lead to longer waiting times and queue lengths, especially in systems with varying service times. This can be problematic in systems where timeliness is a critical concern, as non-preemptive scheduling cannot prioritize processes based on their deadlines.

In conclusion, evaluating the effectiveness of non-preemptive scheduling involves studying its impact on various metrics, such as average waiting time, queue length, and throughput. While it may not be suitable for all types of queueing systems, non-preemptive scheduling can still be an effective policy in certain scenarios, such as in systems with known service times or in systems where fairness is a critical concern. 





#### 8.4a Definition and Analysis of Polling Systems

Polling systems are a type of scheduling system where a central device or process queries each element in a fixed sequence, waiting for a response from each element before moving on to the next. This process continues until the central device reaches the first element again, at which point the polling cycle starts all over again. This type of scheduling is commonly used in computer networks, operating systems, and other systems where multiple elements need to access a shared resource.

The optimal polling cycle, or the time in which each element is monitored once, will vary according to several factors, including the desired speed of response and the overhead (e.g., processor time and bandwidth) of the polling. For example, in roll call polling, the polling device or process queries each element on a list in a fixed sequence. However, because it waits for a response from each element, a timing mechanism is necessary to prevent lock-ups caused by non-responding elements. This can be inefficient if the overhead for the polling messages is high, there are numerous elements to be polled in each polling cycle, and only a few elements are active.

On the other hand, in hub polling, also referred to as token polling, each element polls the next element in some fixed sequence. This continues until the first element is reached, at which time the polling cycle starts all over again. This type of polling can be more efficient than roll call polling, especially in systems with low overhead and a small number of active elements.

Polling can be employed in various computing contexts in order to control the execution or transmission sequence of the elements involved. For example, in multitasking operating systems, polling can be used to allocate processor time and other resources to the various competing processes. In networks, polling is used to determine which nodes want to access the network. It is also used by routing protocols to retrieve routing information, as is the case with EGP (exterior gateway protocol).

An alternative to polling is the use of interrupts, which are signals generated by devices or processes to indicate that they need attention, want to communicate, etc. While polling can be very simple, in many situations it is more efficient to use interrupts because it can reduce processor usage and/or bandwidth consumption. However, the use of interrupts can also introduce additional complexity and overhead, making polling a more attractive option in some cases.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the analysis of polling systems, exploring various performance metrics and techniques for optimizing polling cycles.

#### 8.4b Performance Measures of Polling Systems

Performance measures are crucial in evaluating the effectiveness of polling systems. These measures provide a quantitative way to assess the system's performance and identify areas for improvement. In this section, we will discuss some of the key performance measures for polling systems.

##### Average Response Time

The average response time is the average amount of time an element spends waiting for its turn in the polling cycle. It is a measure of the system's responsiveness. The lower the average response time, the more responsive the system is. The average response time can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Average Response Time} = \frac{\text{Total Waiting Time}}{\text{Total Number of Elements}}
$$

where Total Waiting Time is the sum of the waiting time for each element and Total Number of Elements is the number of elements in the system.

##### Throughput

The throughput is the number of elements that can be served per unit time. It is a measure of the system's capacity. The higher the throughput, the more elements the system can serve in a given time period. The throughput can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Throughput} = \frac{\text{Total Number of Elements}}{\text{Total Time}}
$$

where Total Number of Elements is the number of elements served and Total Time is the total time the system has been operating.

##### Utilization

The utilization is the proportion of time the system is busy serving elements. It is a measure of the system's efficiency. The higher the utilization, the more efficient the system is. The utilization can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Utilization} = \frac{\text{Total Busy Time}}{\text{Total Time}}
$$

where Total Busy Time is the total time the system is busy serving elements and Total Time is the total time the system has been operating.

##### Overhead

The overhead is the amount of time spent on polling activities. It is a measure of the system's efficiency. The lower the overhead, the more efficient the system is. The overhead can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Overhead} = \frac{\text{Total Polling Time}}{\text{Total Time}}
$$

where Total Polling Time is the total time spent on polling activities and Total Time is the total time the system has been operating.

These performance measures provide a comprehensive view of the system's performance. By monitoring these measures, we can identify areas for improvement and make necessary adjustments to optimize the system's performance. In the next section, we will discuss some techniques for optimizing polling systems.

#### 8.4c Case Studies of Polling Systems

In this section, we will explore some real-world case studies that illustrate the application of polling systems. These case studies will provide practical examples of how polling systems are used in various contexts and how the performance measures discussed in the previous section are applied.

##### Case Study 1: Token Ring Network

Token Ring networks are a type of local area network (LAN) that use a token-passing protocol for data transmission. In a Token Ring network, each node has the opportunity to transmit data by passing a token around the ring. The node that holds the token can transmit data, and the token is then passed on to the next node. This system can be modeled as a polling system, where each node is an element and the token is the polling device.

The performance of this system can be evaluated using the performance measures discussed in the previous section. For example, the average response time can be used to measure the responsiveness of the system. If a node has to wait a long time for its turn to transmit data, the average response time will be high, indicating a slow and unresponsive system.

The throughput can be used to measure the capacity of the system. If the number of nodes in the network is high, and the data transmission rate is low, the throughput will be low, indicating a system that cannot handle a large number of nodes.

The utilization can be used to measure the efficiency of the system. If the token is passed around the ring frequently, the utilization will be high, indicating an efficient system.

The overhead can be used to measure the efficiency of the token-passing protocol. If the token is passed around the ring frequently, the overhead will be high, indicating an inefficient system.

##### Case Study 2: Multitasking Operating System

Multitasking operating systems are another example of a system that can be modeled as a polling system. In a multitasking operating system, each task is an element, and the operating system is the polling device. The operating system polls each task in turn, giving each task a chance to run.

The performance of this system can be evaluated using the performance measures discussed in the previous section. For example, the average response time can be used to measure the responsiveness of the system. If a task has to wait a long time for its turn to run, the average response time will be high, indicating a slow and unresponsive system.

The throughput can be used to measure the capacity of the system. If the number of tasks is high, and the processing rate is low, the throughput will be low, indicating a system that cannot handle a large number of tasks.

The utilization can be used to measure the efficiency of the system. If the operating system polls each task frequently, the utilization will be high, indicating an efficient system.

The overhead can be used to measure the efficiency of the polling process. If the operating system polls each task frequently, the overhead will be high, indicating an inefficient system.

These case studies illustrate the practical application of polling systems and the importance of performance measures in evaluating the performance of these systems.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the intricacies of priority and polling systems, two fundamental concepts in queueing theory. We have explored how these systems operate, their advantages, and their limitations. We have also examined the mathematical models that underpin these systems, providing a solid foundation for understanding and applying these concepts in real-world scenarios.

Priority systems, as we have seen, allow certain elements to jump the queue, improving the efficiency of the system. However, this can lead to unfairness and potential instability if not properly managed. On the other hand, polling systems, with their round-robin approach, ensure fairness but can lead to inefficiency if the elements have widely varying service times.

The mathematical models we have discussed, such as the M/G/1 queue and the M/G/k queue, provide a framework for analyzing these systems. These models allow us to calculate important performance measures, such as the average queue length and the average waiting time, which are crucial for evaluating the performance of these systems.

In conclusion, understanding priority and polling systems is essential for anyone working in the field of queueing theory. These systems are fundamental to many real-world applications, and their study provides a solid foundation for more advanced topics in queueing theory.

## Chapter: Chapter 9: Advanced Topics in Queueing Theory

### Introduction

In this chapter, we delve deeper into the fascinating world of queueing theory, exploring advanced topics that build upon the fundamental concepts covered in the previous chapters. We will be discussing complex queueing models, advanced performance measures, and sophisticated techniques for analyzing and optimizing queueing systems.

Queueing theory is a powerful tool for understanding and improving the performance of systems where customers or tasks arrive, wait in a queue, and are eventually served. It has applications in a wide range of fields, from telecommunications and computer networks to manufacturing and healthcare. The advanced topics covered in this chapter will provide you with the knowledge and skills to tackle more complex queueing problems and to make more informed decisions.

We will begin by introducing more complex queueing models, such as multi-server queues, finite-capacity queues, and queues with multiple queues. These models allow for more realistic representations of real-world systems, where customers may be served by multiple servers, where the queue capacity is finite, and where there may be multiple queues serving different types of customers.

Next, we will discuss advanced performance measures, such as the queue length distribution, the waiting time distribution, and the response time distribution. These measures provide a more detailed understanding of the system performance than the simple average queue length and average waiting time.

Finally, we will explore sophisticated techniques for analyzing and optimizing queueing systems. These techniques include the use of generating functions, the use of Markov chains, and the use of simulation methods. These techniques allow for more accurate and more efficient analysis of queueing systems.

Throughout this chapter, we will be using the mathematical notation and concepts introduced in the previous chapters. For example, we will be using the notation $L(n)$ for the average queue length, $W(n)$ for the average waiting time, and $R(n)$ for the average response time. We will also be using the concept of a queueing system, which is a system where customers or tasks arrive, wait in a queue, and are eventually served.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a deeper understanding of queueing theory and be equipped with the knowledge and skills to tackle more complex queueing problems. You will be able to apply these advanced topics to improve the performance of queueing systems in a wide range of fields.




#### 8.4b Performance Evaluation of Polling Systems

The performance of a polling system can be evaluated using various metrics, including the average response time, the average queue length, and the average number of elements waiting in the queue. These metrics can provide valuable insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of the polling system.

The average response time is the time taken for a polling device or process to respond to a request from an element. It is a critical metric as it directly impacts the user experience. A shorter average response time indicates a more efficient system. The average response time can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average response time is equal to the average queue length divided by the average arrival rate.

The average queue length is the number of elements waiting in the queue for a response from the polling device or process. It is a measure of the system's backlog. A longer average queue length indicates a higher level of congestion in the system. The average queue length can be calculated using Little's Law as well.

The average number of elements waiting in the queue is the number of elements that are currently waiting for a response from the polling device or process. It is a measure of the system's utilization. A higher average number of elements waiting in the queue indicates a higher level of system utilization. The average number of elements waiting in the queue can be calculated using Little's Law as well.

In addition to these metrics, the performance of a polling system can also be evaluated using the polling cycle time and the overhead for the polling messages. The polling cycle time is the time taken for the polling device or process to query each element once. It is a measure of the system's throughput. A shorter polling cycle time indicates a higher throughput. The overhead for the polling messages is the amount of processor time and bandwidth used for the polling messages. It is a measure of the system's efficiency. A lower overhead indicates a more efficient system.

In the next section, we will discuss some advanced applications of polling systems, including their use in computer networks and operating systems.

#### 8.4c Fairness in Polling Systems

Fairness is a critical aspect of polling systems. It refers to the equitable distribution of resources among the elements in the system. In the context of polling systems, fairness is often associated with the order in which elements are served.

The fairness of a polling system can be evaluated using the concept of fairness index. The fairness index is a measure of the fairness of the system, where 0 represents perfect fairness (all elements are served in the same order) and 1 represents complete unfairness (only one element is served). The fairness index can be calculated using the formula:

$$
F = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left| \frac{S_i - A}{S_i} \right|
$$

where $F$ is the fairness index, $n$ is the number of elements, $S_i$ is the service time of element $i$, and $A$ is the average service time.

A fair polling system should aim to minimize the fairness index. This means that all elements should be served in a similar order, with minimal deviation from the average service time.

However, achieving perfect fairness in a polling system can be challenging due to the inherent variability in service times and arrival rates among elements. Therefore, it is often necessary to balance fairness with other performance metrics, such as average response time and queue length.

One approach to achieving a balance is to use weighted fair queuing, where each element is assigned a weight that represents its importance or priority. Elements with higher weights are served more frequently, while elements with lower weights are served less frequently. This approach can help to ensure that critical elements are served promptly, while non-critical elements are served less frequently, thereby reducing the average response time and queue length.

Another approach is to use adaptive polling, where the polling cycle time and the order of element service are adjusted dynamically based on the current system conditions. This approach can help to balance fairness with other performance metrics, as it allows the system to adapt to changes in service times and arrival rates among elements.

In conclusion, fairness is a critical aspect of polling systems. It is important to consider fairness when designing and evaluating polling systems, as it can significantly impact the performance and user experience of the system.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the intricacies of priority and polling systems, two fundamental concepts in queueing theory. We have explored how these systems operate, their advantages, and their limitations. We have also examined the mathematical models that govern these systems, providing a solid foundation for understanding and analyzing real-world queueing scenarios.

Priority systems, as we have seen, allow certain elements to jump the queue, thereby improving the efficiency of the system. However, this can lead to perceived unfairness, which must be carefully managed. On the other hand, polling systems, with their fixed sequence of service, ensure fairness but can lead to delays and inefficiency.

The mathematical models we have discussed, such as the M/G/1 and M/G/k models, provide a powerful tool for analyzing these systems. By understanding these models, we can predict the behavior of queueing systems under various conditions, and make informed decisions about system design and operation.

In conclusion, priority and polling systems are essential tools in queueing theory, providing a means to manage queues and ensure fairness. By understanding these systems and their mathematical models, we can design and operate queueing systems that are efficient, fair, and responsive to changing conditions.

## Chapter: Chapter 9: Advanced Topics in Queueing Theory

### Introduction

In this chapter, we delve deeper into the fascinating world of queueing theory, exploring advanced topics that build upon the fundamental concepts covered in the previous chapters. We will be discussing complex queueing models, advanced analytical techniques, and real-world applications of queueing theory.

Queueing theory, as we have learned, is a mathematical discipline that studies the behavior of systems where customers or jobs arrive, wait in a queue, and are eventually served. It is a powerful tool for modeling and analyzing systems where there are multiple competing activities, such as computer systems, telecommunication networks, and manufacturing systems.

In this chapter, we will be exploring advanced topics such as multi-server queues, finite-capacity queues, and queueing networks. We will also be discussing advanced analytical techniques such as Markov chains, generating functions, and moment-based methods. These techniques are essential for solving complex queueing models and understanding the behavior of queueing systems.

We will also be discussing real-world applications of queueing theory. These include traffic flow modeling, call center management, and resource allocation in computer systems. By understanding these applications, we can gain insights into how queueing theory can be used to solve real-world problems.

This chapter is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of advanced topics in queueing theory. It is intended for readers who have a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts of queueing theory. If you are new to queueing theory, we recommend starting with the previous chapters.

As we delve deeper into queueing theory, we will continue to use the popular Markdown format for writing and the MathJax library for rendering mathematical expressions. This will allow us to present complex mathematical concepts in a clear and understandable manner.

In conclusion, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of advanced topics in queueing theory. It is designed to be a valuable resource for students, researchers, and professionals who are interested in queueing theory and its applications.




### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the concepts of priority and polling systems in queueing theory. We have seen how these systems can be used to manage queues and prioritize certain customers or tasks over others. We have also discussed the advantages and disadvantages of using these systems, and how they can be applied in various real-world scenarios.

Priority systems allow for the efficient management of queues by giving certain customers or tasks priority over others. This can be particularly useful in situations where some customers or tasks are more important than others, and need to be served quickly. However, this can also lead to longer wait times for less important customers or tasks, which may not be acceptable in all situations.

Polling systems, on the other hand, allow for a fair distribution of service among all customers or tasks. This can be beneficial in situations where all customers or tasks are equally important, and it is important to ensure that no one is unfairly prioritized. However, polling systems can also lead to longer wait times for all customers or tasks, which may not be acceptable in situations where some customers or tasks are more time-sensitive than others.

Overall, the choice between using priority or polling systems depends on the specific needs and goals of the system. It is important to carefully consider the advantages and disadvantages of each system before making a decision.

### Subsection: 9.1a Definition and Analysis of M/M/s Queueing System

The M/M/s queueing system is a type of multi-server queueing system that is commonly used in various real-world scenarios. It is a simple yet powerful model that allows us to understand the behavior of a queueing system with multiple servers. In this subsection, we will define and analyze the M/M/s queueing system, discussing its characteristics, performance measures, and stability conditions.

#### Definition of M/M/s Queueing System

The M/M/s queueing system is a type of multi-server queueing system where customers arrive at a single queue and are served by s servers. The arrival process is memoryless, meaning that the time between successive arrivals is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). Similarly, the service time is also memoryless, and the service rate is constant for all servers. This means that the service time for each customer is independent and follows an exponential distribution.

The M/M/s queueing system is a special case of the M/G/s queueing system, where the service time distribution is general. In the M/M/s queueing system, the service time distribution is restricted to be exponential, making it a simpler and more tractable model.

#### Analysis of M/M/s Queueing System

The M/M/s queueing system can be analyzed using various techniques, such as Markov chains, birth-death processes, and queueing networks. In this subsection, we will focus on the analysis using Markov chains.

The state of the M/M/s queueing system can be represented by a Markov chain, where the states are the number of customers in the system. The transition probabilities between states can be calculated using the arrival rate λ and the service rate sμ. The stationary distribution of the Markov chain can be used to calculate the probability of the system being in a particular state, which is useful for understanding the behavior of the queueing system.

#### Performance Measures of M/M/s Queueing System

The M/M/s queueing system has several performance measures that are used to evaluate its performance. These include the average number of customers in the system, the average waiting time, and the average queue length. These measures can be calculated using the stationary distribution of the Markov chain or by directly solving the equations for the performance measures.

#### Stability Conditions of M/M/s Queueing System

The M/M/s queueing system is stable if the average number of customers in the system is finite. This can be determined by checking if the traffic intensity ρ = λ/sμ < 1. If the traffic intensity is greater than one, the queue will grow without bound, and the system is considered unstable. The stability conditions can also be visualized using the Erlang's C formula, which gives the probability that an arriving customer is forced to join the queue (all servers are occupied).

In conclusion, the M/M/s queueing system is a fundamental model in queueing theory that allows us to understand the behavior of a queueing system with multiple servers. Its analysis using Markov chains and performance measures provide valuable insights into the performance of the system. The stability conditions of the system are crucial for ensuring its long-term sustainability. 





#### 9.1b Performance Measures in M/M/s Queueing System

The M/M/s queueing system has several important performance measures that can be used to evaluate its performance. These measures include the average number of customers in the system, the average waiting time, and the average queue length. In this subsection, we will define and analyze these performance measures.

##### Average Number of Customers in the System

The average number of customers in the system, denoted by $L$, is a measure of the system's utilization. It represents the average number of customers in the system, including those being served and those waiting in the queue. The average number of customers in the system can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
L = \lambda \cdot E[T]
$$

where $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate and $E[T]$ is the average time a customer spends in the system.

##### Average Waiting Time

The average waiting time, denoted by $W$, is a measure of the time a customer spends waiting in the queue. It is a measure of the system's delay. The average waiting time can be calculated using the Little's Law formula, where the average waiting time is equal to the average number of customers in the system minus the average number of servers busy, divided by the average arrival rate. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
W = \frac{L - sL}{s\lambda}
$$

where $s$ is the number of servers and $L$ is the average number of customers in the system.

##### Average Queue Length

The average queue length, denoted by $L_q$, is a measure of the number of customers waiting in the queue. It is a measure of the system's queue congestion. The average queue length can be calculated using the Little's Law formula, where the average queue length is equal to the average waiting time multiplied by the average arrival rate. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
L_q = W \cdot s\lambda
$$

where $s$ is the number of servers and $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate.

In the next subsection, we will discuss the stability conditions for the M/M/s queueing system.

#### 9.1c Applications of M/M/s Queueing System

The M/M/s queueing system has a wide range of applications in various fields. Its simplicity and tractability make it a popular model for analyzing queueing systems in real-world scenarios. In this section, we will discuss some of the applications of the M/M/s queueing system.

##### Telecommunication Networks

In telecommunication networks, the M/M/s queueing system is used to model the behavior of call centers, data traffic, and packet-based flows. The byte-weighted fair queuing algorithm, for instance, uses the M/M/s queueing system to emulate fairness among competing flows. This algorithm selects the next packet for transmission based on the earliest finish time, which is computed using a virtual timescale. The complexity of this algorithm is $O(log(n))$, where $n$ is the number of queues/flows.

##### Computer Systems

In computer systems, the M/M/s queueing system is used to model the behavior of processors, memory systems, and I/O devices. The system can be used to analyze the performance of these components and optimize their design. For example, the M/M/s queueing system can be used to analyze the performance of a multi-processor system, where each processor is modeled as a server.

##### Manufacturing Systems

In manufacturing systems, the M/M/s queueing system is used to model the behavior of production lines, assembly lines, and material handling systems. The system can be used to analyze the performance of these systems and optimize their design. For example, the M/M/s queueing system can be used to analyze the performance of a production line, where each machine is modeled as a server.

##### Service Systems

In service systems, the M/M/s queueing system is used to model the behavior of call centers, banks, and supermarkets. The system can be used to analyze the performance of these systems and optimize their design. For example, the M/M/s queueing system can be used to analyze the performance of a call center, where each agent is modeled as a server.

In conclusion, the M/M/s queueing system is a powerful tool for analyzing queueing systems in various fields. Its simplicity and tractability make it a popular model for understanding the behavior of queueing systems.




#### 9.2a Definition and Analysis of M/G/s Queueing System

The M/G/s queueing system is a type of multiserver queueing system that is commonly used in the analysis of communication networks, computer systems, and manufacturing systems. It is a special case of the G/G/s queueing system, where the service time distribution follows a general distribution instead of an exponential one. In this section, we will define and analyze the M/G/s queueing system.

##### Definition of M/G/s Queueing System

The M/G/s queueing system is a multiserver queueing system with a single queue and s servers. Customers arrive at the queue according to a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$. The service time for each customer is independent and follows a general distribution with mean $1/\mu$. The service discipline is first-come-first-served (FCFS), meaning that customers are served in the order of their arrival.

##### Analysis of M/G/s Queueing System

The M/G/s queueing system is a special case of the G/G/s queueing system, which means that it inherits many of the properties of the G/G/s queueing system. In particular, the M/G/s queueing system is also a product-form queueing system, meaning that the probability of a system with k customers can be expressed as the product of the probability of a system with k-1 customers and the probability of a new arrival. This property simplifies the analysis of the system and allows us to derive important performance measures.

One of the key performance measures of the M/G/s queueing system is the average number of customers in the system, denoted by $L$. As in the M/M/s queueing system, the average number of customers in the system can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
L = \lambda \cdot E[T]
$$

where $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate and $E[T]$ is the average time a customer spends in the system.

Another important performance measure is the average waiting time, denoted by $W$. The average waiting time can be calculated using the Little's Law formula, where the average waiting time is equal to the average number of customers in the system minus the average number of servers busy, divided by the average arrival rate. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
W = \frac{L - sL}{s\lambda}
$$

where $s$ is the number of servers and $L$ is the average number of customers in the system.

In the next section, we will explore the performance of the M/G/s queueing system in more detail and discuss how the arrival rate and service rate affect the system's performance.

#### 9.2b Performance Measures in M/G/s Queueing System

The M/G/s queueing system, like the M/M/s queueing system, has several important performance measures that can be used to evaluate its performance. These measures include the average number of customers in the system, the average waiting time, and the average queue length. In this subsection, we will define and analyze these performance measures.

##### Average Number of Customers in the System

The average number of customers in the system, denoted by $L$, is a measure of the system's utilization. It represents the average number of customers in the system, including those being served and those waiting in the queue. The average number of customers in the system can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
L = \lambda \cdot E[T]
$$

where $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate and $E[T]$ is the average time a customer spends in the system.

##### Average Waiting Time

The average waiting time, denoted by $W$, is a measure of the time a customer spends waiting in the queue. It is a measure of the system's delay. The average waiting time can be calculated using the Little's Law formula, where the average waiting time is equal to the average number of customers in the system minus the average number of servers busy, divided by the average arrival rate. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
W = \frac{L - sL}{s\lambda}
$$

where $s$ is the number of servers and $L$ is the average number of customers in the system.

The M/G/s queueing system is a multiserver queueing system where customers arrive according to a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$ and service times follow a general distribution with mean $1/\mu$. In this subsection, we will define and analyze the busy period and response time of the M/G/s queueing system.

##### Busy Period

The busy period, denoted by $B$, is the time interval during which the system is busy serving customers. It is the time between two consecutive idle periods. The busy period can be calculated using the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula, which states that the average busy period is equal to the average waiting time multiplied by the average number of customers in the system. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
B = W \cdot L
$$

where $W$ is the average waiting time and $L$ is the average number of customers in the system.

##### Response Time

The response time, denoted by $R$, is the total amount of time a customer spends in the system, including both the waiting time and the service time. The response time can be calculated using the Little's Law formula, where the average response time is equal to the average waiting time plus the average service time. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
R = W + \frac{1}{\mu}
$$

where $W$ is the average waiting time and $\mu$ is the average service rate.

These measures are crucial for understanding the behavior of the M/G/s queueing system and for making decisions about system design and resource allocation.

It can be calculated using Little's Law, as mentioned earlier, or directly from the probability mass function of the number of customers in the system. The average waiting time can be expressed as:

$$
W = \frac{L - L_b}{L}
$$

where $L_b$ is the average number of customers in the system when there are no queues, also known as the busy period.

##### Average Queue Length

The average queue length, denoted by $L_q$, is the average number of customers waiting in the queue. It can be calculated from the average waiting time and the average number of customers in the system:

For example, if the average waiting time is high, it may indicate that there are not enough machine tools to handle the incoming jobs. By increasing the number of servers, the average waiting time can be reduced, thereby improving the overall efficiency of the production line. Similarly, if the average queue length is high, it may indicate that there are too many jobs being queued, which can lead to job delay.

#### 9.4a Definition and Analysis of G/G/s Queueing System

The G/G/s queueing system is a type of multiserver queueing system that is commonly used in the analysis of communication networks, computer systems, and manufacturing systems. It is a generalization of the G/M/s queueing system, which assumes that the service time distribution follows a general distribution. In the G/G/s queueing system, both the arrival process and the service process can follow any general distribution, making it a more flexible and realistic model for many real-world systems.

The G/G/s queueing system is defined by three key parameters: the arrival rate $\lambda$, the service rate $\mu$, and the number of servers $s$. The arrival rate $\lambda$ represents the average number of customers arriving at the system per unit time, while the service rate $\mu$ represents the average number of customers that can be served by each server per unit time. The number of servers $s$ determines the number of servers available to serve customers.

The performance of the G/G/s queueing system can be analyzed using a variety of performance measures, as discussed in the previous section. However, due to the complexity of the G/G/s queueing system, analytical results are often not available, and numerical methods must be used to approximate the performance measures.

One of the key challenges in analyzing the G/G/s queueing system is the lack of a simple formula for the response time distribution, as is available for the fork-join queue. However, an approximate formula can be used to calculate the response time distribution for a network of fork-join queues joined in series (one after the other). This formula can be used as a starting point for more complex systems, but it may not provide accurate results for systems with a large number of queues or complex service processes.

Another related model is the split-merge model, for which analytical results exist. Exact results for the split-merge queue are given by Fiorini and Lipsky. In the split-merge model, a job is split into "N" sub-tasks which are serviced in parallel. Only when all the tasks finish servicing and have rejoined can the next job start. This leads to a slower response time on average.

A generalization of the fork-join queueing system is the $(n,k)$ fork-join system where the job exits the system when any $k$ out of $n$ tasks are served. The traditional fork-join queueing system is a special case of the $(n,k)$ system when $k = n$. Bounds on the mean response time of this generalized system were found by Joshi, Liu, and Soljanin.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the key performance measures for the G/G/s queueing system, including the average number of customers in the system, the average waiting time, and the average queue length. We will also discuss some of the numerical methods that can be used to approximate these performance measures.

Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
\rho = \frac{\lambda \cdot E[T]}{s}

The performance of a G/G/s queueing system can be evaluated using a variety of performance measures. These measures provide a quantitative way to assess the system's performance and can be used to compare different system configurations or to monitor the system's performance over time.

One of the most commonly used performance measures is the average queue length. This measure represents the average number of customers waiting in the queue. It can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average queue length is equal to the average number of customers in the system minus the average number of customers being served.

Another important performance measure is the average response time. This measure represents the average amount of time a customer spends in the system, including both the time spent waiting in the queue and the time spent being served. It can be calculated using the Little's Law formula:

$$
L = \lambda W
$$

The average queue length and average response time can be used to calculate other performance measures, such as the average waiting time and the average waiting time in the queue. These measures can be calculated using the Little's Law formula:

## Chapter 10: Advanced Queueing Theory:




### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of queues in the Halfin-Whitt regime. This regime is named after Ward Whitt and William Halfin, two renowned researchers in the field of queueing theory. The Halfin-Whitt regime is a fundamental concept in queueing theory, and it has been extensively studied and applied in various fields.

The Halfin-Whitt regime is a regime of heavy traffic, where the system is operating at high utilization levels. In this regime, the queue length distribution is governed by a deterministic function, known as the Halfin-Whitt diffusion. This diffusion process is a stochastic process that describes the evolution of the queue length in the system. It is a key tool in the analysis of queues in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

In this chapter, we will explore the mathematical foundations of the Halfin-Whitt regime, including the derivation of the Halfin-Whitt diffusion. We will also discuss the implications of this regime for the performance of queueing systems, and how it can be used to design and optimize queueing systems in practice.

We will also delve into advanced applications of the Halfin-Whitt regime, including its use in the analysis of networks of queues and its application in the design of queueing systems with multiple servers. We will also discuss the limitations and challenges of the Halfin-Whitt regime, and how it can be extended to more complex queueing systems.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the Halfin-Whitt regime, from its fundamental concepts to its advanced applications. It is designed to be accessible to both students and practitioners in the field of queueing theory. We hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource for anyone interested in understanding and applying the Halfin-Whitt regime in queueing theory.




#### 10.1a Definition and Analysis of Heavy-Traffic Limits

In the previous chapters, we have discussed the fundamentals of queueing theory, including the concepts of queue length, waiting time, and utilization. We have also introduced the Halfin-Whitt regime, a regime of heavy traffic where the system is operating at high utilization levels. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of heavy-traffic limits and their implications for queueing systems.

The heavy-traffic limit is a mathematical concept that describes the behavior of queueing systems as the system size (or the number of servers) approaches infinity. In the context of the Halfin-Whitt regime, the heavy-traffic limit is often used to analyze the performance of queueing systems under heavy traffic conditions.

The heavy-traffic limit is typically characterized by the following properties:

1. The queue length distribution is governed by a deterministic function, known as the Halfin-Whitt diffusion. This diffusion process describes the evolution of the queue length in the system and is a key tool in the analysis of queues in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

2. The queue length is asymptotically normally distributed. This means that as the system size approaches infinity, the queue length distribution approaches a normal distribution.

3. The waiting time is asymptotically exponentially distributed. This means that as the system size approaches infinity, the waiting time distribution approaches an exponential distribution.

These properties have important implications for the performance of queueing systems. For instance, they can be used to derive upper bounds on the queue length and waiting time, which can be useful in the design and optimization of queueing systems.

In the next section, we will explore the mathematical foundations of the heavy-traffic limit, including the derivation of the Halfin-Whitt diffusion and the proof of the asymptotic normality and exponentiality of the queue length and waiting time. We will also discuss the implications of these properties for the performance of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

#### 10.1b Performance Measures in Heavy-Traffic Limits

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of heavy-traffic limits and discussed their properties. In this section, we will delve deeper into the performance measures in heavy-traffic limits, focusing on the queue length, waiting time, and utilization.

The queue length, waiting time, and utilization are fundamental performance measures in queueing theory. They provide valuable insights into the behavior of queueing systems and can be used to evaluate the performance of these systems. In the context of heavy-traffic limits, these performance measures take on a specific form that is characterized by the properties of the heavy-traffic limit.

The queue length in heavy-traffic limits is governed by the Halfin-Whitt diffusion. This diffusion process describes the evolution of the queue length in the system and is a key tool in the analysis of queues in the Halfin-Whitt regime. The queue length distribution is asymptotically normally distributed, which means that as the system size approaches infinity, the queue length distribution approaches a normal distribution.

The waiting time in heavy-traffic limits is asymptotically exponentially distributed. This means that as the system size approaches infinity, the waiting time distribution approaches an exponential distribution. This property is particularly useful in the design and optimization of queueing systems, as it allows us to derive upper bounds on the waiting time.

The utilization in heavy-traffic limits is typically high, reflecting the fact that the system is operating at high utilization levels. This is a direct consequence of the heavy-traffic limit, where the system size approaches infinity and the system is operating at high utilization levels.

In the next section, we will explore the mathematical foundations of these performance measures in heavy-traffic limits, including the derivation of the Halfin-Whitt diffusion and the proof of the asymptotic normality and exponentiality of the queue length and waiting time. We will also discuss the implications of these properties for the performance of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

#### 10.1c Modeling Queues in Heavy-Traffic Limits

In this section, we will explore the modeling of queues in heavy-traffic limits. The modeling of queues in heavy-traffic limits is a crucial aspect of queueing theory, as it allows us to understand the behavior of queueing systems under heavy traffic conditions.

The modeling of queues in heavy-traffic limits involves the use of stochastic processes, particularly the Halfin-Whitt diffusion. The Halfin-Whitt diffusion is a deterministic function that governs the queue length in heavy-traffic limits. It describes the evolution of the queue length in the system and is a key tool in the analysis of queues in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

The Halfin-Whitt diffusion is defined as follows:

$$
\frac{dX}{dt} = \mu - \lambda X
$$

where $X$ is the queue length, $\mu$ is the arrival rate, and $\lambda$ is the service rate. The Halfin-Whitt diffusion is a diffusion process, which means that it describes the evolution of the queue length in the system over time.

In heavy-traffic limits, the queue length distribution is asymptotically normally distributed. This means that as the system size approaches infinity, the queue length distribution approaches a normal distribution. This property is particularly useful in the design and optimization of queueing systems, as it allows us to derive upper bounds on the queue length.

The waiting time in heavy-traffic limits is asymptotically exponentially distributed. This means that as the system size approaches infinity, the waiting time distribution approaches an exponential distribution. This property is particularly useful in the design and optimization of queueing systems, as it allows us to derive upper bounds on the waiting time.

The utilization in heavy-traffic limits is typically high, reflecting the fact that the system is operating at high utilization levels. This is a direct consequence of the heavy-traffic limit, where the system size approaches infinity and the system is operating at high utilization levels.

In the next section, we will explore the mathematical foundations of these properties, including the derivation of the Halfin-Whitt diffusion and the proof of the asymptotic normality and exponentiality of the queue length and waiting time. We will also discuss the implications of these properties for the performance of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

The performance analysis in heavy-traffic limits involves the use of various performance measures, such as the queue length, waiting time, and utilization. These performance measures are used to evaluate the performance of queueing systems and to make decisions about system design and optimization.

The queue length in heavy-traffic limits is governed by the Halfin-Whitt diffusion. As we have seen in the previous section, the Halfin-Whitt diffusion is a deterministic function that describes the evolution of the queue length in the system over time. The queue length distribution is asymptotically normally distributed in heavy-traffic limits, which means that as the system size approaches infinity, the queue length distribution approaches a normal distribution. This property is particularly useful in the design and optimization of queueing systems, as it allows us to derive upper bounds on the queue length.

The waiting time in heavy-traffic limits is asymptotically exponentially distributed. This means that as the system size approaches infinity, the waiting time distribution approaches an exponential distribution. This property is particularly useful in the design and optimization of queueing systems, as it allows us to derive upper bounds on the waiting time.

One of the most common applications of heavy-traffic limits is in the analysis of telecommunication networks. In these networks, the traffic is often modeled as a heavy-traffic limit, where the system size (number of users) approaches infinity. This allows us to derive upper bounds on the queue length, waiting time, and utilization, which are crucial for the design and optimization of these networks.

Another important application of heavy-traffic limits is in the analysis of computer systems. In these systems, the traffic is often modeled as a heavy-traffic limit, where the system size (number of processes) approaches infinity.

This is particularly useful in the context of the Halfin-Whitt regime, where the system is operating at high utilization levels and the system size is often large.

One of the key implications of the heavy-traffic limit is the deterministic nature of the queue length distribution. In the Halfin-Whitt regime, the queue length distribution is governed by a deterministic function, known as the Halfin-Whitt diffusion. This diffusion process describes the evolution of the queue length in the system and is a key tool in the analysis of queues in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

The deterministic nature of the queue length distribution has important implications for the performance of queueing systems. For instance, it allows us to derive upper bounds on the queue length and waiting time, which can be useful in the design and optimization of queueing systems.

Another important implication of the heavy-traffic limit is the asymptotic normality of the queue length distribution. As the system size approaches infinity, the queue length distribution approaches a normal distribution. This property can be useful in the design of queueing systems, as it allows us to make predictions about the behavior of the system under heavy traffic conditions.

Finally, the heavy-traffic limit also implies the asymptotic exponentiality of the waiting time distribution. As the system size approaches infinity, the waiting time distribution approaches an exponential distribution. This property is particularly useful in the context of the Halfin-Whitt regime, where the system is often operating at high utilization levels and the waiting time can be a critical performance metric.

In the next section, we will explore the mathematical foundations of the heavy-traffic limit, including the derivation of the Halfin-Whitt diffusion and the proof of the asymptotic normality and exponentiality of the queue length and waiting time.

#### 10.1c Case Studies of Queues in Heavy-Traffic Regime

In this section, we will explore some case studies of queueing systems in the heavy-traffic regime. These case studies will provide a practical perspective on the concepts and theories discussed in the previous sections.

##### Case Study 1: Telecommunication Network

Consider a telecommunication network with a large number of users. The network is designed to handle a certain amount of traffic, but due to unexpected events such as a natural disaster or a viral social media trend, the network experiences a sudden increase in traffic. This leads to a heavy-traffic regime, where the system is operating at high utilization levels.

In this scenario, the heavy-traffic limit is particularly useful. The deterministic nature of the queue length distribution, as governed by the Halfin-Whitt diffusion, allows us to make predictions about the behavior of the system. We can derive upper bounds on the queue length and waiting time, which can be crucial in managing the network and ensuring that the service is not disrupted.

The asymptotic normality of the queue length distribution also provides valuable insights. It allows us to make predictions about the behavior of the system under heavy traffic conditions, which can be useful in the design and optimization of the network.

Finally, the asymptotic exponentiality of the waiting time distribution is particularly useful in this context. The waiting time can be a critical performance metric in a telecommunication network, and the exponential distribution provides a simple and intuitive way to understand the behavior of the system under heavy traffic conditions.

##### Case Study 2: Call Center

Consider a call center that receives a large number of calls. The call center is designed to handle a certain amount of traffic, but due to a marketing campaign or a technical issue, the call volume suddenly increases, leading to a heavy-traffic regime.

In this scenario, the heavy-traffic limit is again a powerful tool. The deterministic nature of the queue length distribution allows us to make predictions about the behavior of the system. We can derive upper bounds on the queue length and waiting time, which can be crucial in managing the call center and ensuring that the service is not disrupted.

The asymptotic normality of the queue length distribution provides valuable insights into the behavior of the system under heavy traffic conditions. It allows us to make predictions about the system, which can be useful in the design and optimization of the call center.

Finally, the asymptotic exponentiality of the waiting time distribution is particularly useful in this context. The waiting time can be a critical performance metric in a call center, and the exponential distribution provides a simple and intuitive way to understand the behavior of the system under heavy traffic conditions.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical foundations of the heavy-traffic limit, including the derivation of the Halfin-Whitt diffusion and the proof of the asymptotic normality and exponentiality of the queue length and waiting time.




#### 10.2a Definition and Analysis of Fluid Limit

The fluid limit is a concept that is closely related to the heavy-traffic limit. It is a mathematical model that describes the behavior of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. The fluid limit is particularly useful for analyzing queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime, as it allows us to make predictions about the behavior of the system as the system size approaches infinity.

The fluid limit is defined as the limit of the queue length distribution as the system size approaches infinity. In other words, it is the limit of the probability distribution of the queue length in the system as the system size approaches infinity. This limit is often denoted by the symbol $\rho$, and it is a key parameter in the analysis of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

The fluid limit has several important properties that make it a useful tool for analyzing queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. One of these properties is the deterministic nature of the queue length distribution. Just like the heavy-traffic limit, the fluid limit also implies that the queue length distribution is governed by a deterministic function, known as the Halfin-Whitt diffusion. This diffusion process describes the evolution of the queue length in the system and is a key tool in the analysis of queues in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

Another important property of the fluid limit is its relationship with the heavy-traffic limit. The fluid limit is often used to approximate the heavy-traffic limit, as it is easier to analyze than the heavy-traffic limit. This approximation is particularly useful in the context of the Halfin-Whitt regime, where the system is operating at high utilization levels and the system size is often large.

The fluid limit also has implications for the performance of queueing systems. For instance, it allows us to derive upper bounds on the queue length and waiting time, which can be useful in the design and optimization of queueing systems. Furthermore, the fluid limit also implies the asymptotic normality of the queue length distribution, which can be useful in the design of queueing systems.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the implications of the fluid limit for queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. We will explore how the fluid limit can be used to analyze the performance of queueing systems and how it can be used to design and optimize queueing systems.

#### 10.2b Performance Measures in Fluid Limit

The fluid limit provides a powerful framework for analyzing queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. It allows us to make predictions about the behavior of the system as the system size approaches infinity, and it provides a deterministic model for the queue length distribution. In this section, we will explore some of the key performance measures that can be derived from the fluid limit.

One of the most important performance measures in the fluid limit is the queue length distribution. As we have seen, the fluid limit implies that the queue length distribution is governed by a deterministic function, known as the Halfin-Whitt diffusion. This diffusion process describes the evolution of the queue length in the system, and it can be used to derive the queue length distribution.

The queue length distribution is a crucial performance measure, as it provides information about the average queue length in the system. This is particularly important in the context of the Halfin-Whitt regime, where the system is operating at high utilization levels and the queue length can have a significant impact on the performance of the system.

Another important performance measure in the fluid limit is the waiting time distribution. The waiting time distribution describes the probability distribution of the time that a customer spends waiting in the queue. This is a key performance measure, as it provides information about the average waiting time in the system.

The waiting time distribution can be derived from the queue length distribution, and it is often used to analyze the performance of queueing systems. For instance, it can be used to derive upper bounds on the average waiting time in the system, which can be useful in the design and optimization of queueing systems.

The fluid limit also implies the asymptotic normality of the queue length distribution. This means that as the system size approaches infinity, the queue length distribution approaches a normal distribution. This property can be useful in the design of queueing systems, as it allows us to make predictions about the behavior of the system under heavy traffic conditions.

In the next section, we will explore some of the key applications of the fluid limit in queueing theory. We will see how the fluid limit can be used to analyze queueing systems in a variety of scenarios, and we will discuss some of the challenges and limitations of this approach.

#### 10.2c Modeling Queueing Systems using Fluid Limit

The fluid limit provides a powerful tool for modeling queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. It allows us to make predictions about the behavior of the system as the system size approaches infinity, and it provides a deterministic model for the queue length distribution. In this section, we will explore how to model queueing systems using the fluid limit.

The first step in modeling a queueing system using the fluid limit is to define the system. This involves specifying the arrival rate of customers, the service rate of the servers, and the number of servers. These parameters can be represented as $\lambda$, $\mu$, and $N$, respectively.

The fluid limit is then used to model the evolution of the queue length in the system. This is done by solving the Halfin-Whitt diffusion, which describes the evolution of the queue length in the system. The solution to this diffusion process provides the queue length distribution, which can be used to derive the waiting time distribution.

The waiting time distribution is a crucial performance measure, as it provides information about the average waiting time in the system. This can be used to derive upper bounds on the average waiting time, which can be useful in the design and optimization of queueing systems.

The fluid limit also implies the asymptotic normality of the queue length distribution. This means that as the system size approaches infinity, the queue length distribution approaches a normal distribution. This property can be useful in the design of queueing systems, as it allows us to make predictions about the behavior of the system under heavy traffic conditions.

In the next section, we will explore some of the key applications of the fluid limit in queueing theory. We will see how the fluid limit can be used to analyze queueing systems in a variety of scenarios, and we will discuss some of the challenges and limitations of this approach.

#### 10.3a Definition and Analysis of Heavy-Tailed Distribution

In the previous sections, we have discussed the fluid limit and its applications in modeling queueing systems. The fluid limit is a powerful tool that allows us to make predictions about the behavior of queueing systems as the system size approaches infinity. However, the fluid limit is based on the assumption that the arrival and service rates are constant, which may not always be the case in real-world queueing systems. In this section, we will explore the concept of heavy-tailed distributions and how they can be used to model queueing systems with varying arrival and service rates.

A heavy-tailed distribution is a probability distribution that has a long right tail, meaning that there is a high probability of observing large values. This is in contrast to a light-tailed distribution, which has a short right tail and a lower probability of observing large values. The term "heavy-tailed" is often used to describe distributions that have a power-law tail, meaning that the probability of observing large values decreases slowly.

In the context of queueing theory, heavy-tailed distributions are often used to model systems with varying arrival and service rates. This is because heavy-tailed distributions can capture the variability in arrival and service rates, which is often observed in real-world queueing systems. For example, in a call center, the arrival rate of calls may vary throughout the day due to different factors such as time of day, day of the week, and special events. Similarly, the service rate of the agents may also vary due to factors such as agent availability, training, and workload.

The concept of heavy-tailed distributions was first introduced by Paul Lévy in the early 20th century. Lévy's work on heavy-tailed distributions laid the foundation for the development of queueing theory. In the context of queueing theory, heavy-tailed distributions are often used to model systems with varying arrival and service rates, as they can capture the long-range dependence and variability observed in these systems.

In the next section, we will explore some of the key properties of heavy-tailed distributions and how they can be used to model queueing systems. We will also discuss some of the challenges and limitations of using heavy-tailed distributions in queueing theory.

#### 10.3b Performance Measures in Heavy-Tailed Distribution

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of heavy-tailed distributions and how they can be used to model queueing systems with varying arrival and service rates. In this section, we will explore some of the key performance measures that can be used to evaluate the performance of queueing systems with heavy-tailed distributions.

One of the most commonly used performance measures in queueing theory is the average queue length. The average queue length is defined as the average number of customers waiting in the queue. In the context of heavy-tailed distributions, the average queue length can be a challenging metric to calculate due to the long-range dependence and variability in arrival and service rates. However, it is still a useful metric for evaluating the performance of queueing systems.

Another important performance measure is the average waiting time. The average waiting time is defined as the average amount of time that a customer spends waiting in the queue. Similar to the average queue length, the average waiting time can be a challenging metric to calculate in queueing systems with heavy-tailed distributions. However, it is still a useful metric for evaluating the performance of queueing systems.

In addition to these traditional performance measures, there are also more advanced metrics that can be used to evaluate the performance of queueing systems with heavy-tailed distributions. These include the coefficient of variation, the Erlang's loss formula, and the Erlang's C formula. These metrics take into account the variability and long-range dependence in arrival and service rates, making them more suitable for evaluating the performance of queueing systems with heavy-tailed distributions.

In the next section, we will explore some of the key properties of heavy-tailed distributions and how they can be used to model queueing systems. We will also discuss some of the challenges and limitations of using heavy-tailed distributions in queueing theory.

#### 10.3c Modeling Queueing Systems using Heavy-Tailed Distribution

In this section, we will explore how heavy-tailed distributions can be used to model queueing systems. As mentioned earlier, heavy-tailed distributions are often used to model systems with varying arrival and service rates. This is because they can capture the long-range dependence and variability observed in these systems.

One of the key advantages of using heavy-tailed distributions in queueing systems is their ability to model systems with varying arrival and service rates. This is achieved through the use of power-law tails, which allow for a wide range of arrival and service rates to be modeled. This is particularly useful in real-world queueing systems, where arrival and service rates can vary significantly due to various factors.

Another advantage of using heavy-tailed distributions is their ability to capture the long-range dependence observed in queueing systems. This is achieved through the use of long-range correlations, which allow for the modeling of systems with a high degree of variability. This is particularly useful in queueing systems where the arrival and service rates can change rapidly and unpredictably.

However, there are also some challenges and limitations to using heavy-tailed distributions in queueing systems. One of the main challenges is the difficulty in calculating traditional performance measures, such as the average queue length and average waiting time. This is due to the long-range dependence and variability in arrival and service rates, which can make these metrics difficult to estimate accurately.

Another limitation of using heavy-tailed distributions is their inability to capture the behavior of systems with extremely high or low arrival and service rates. This is because heavy-tailed distributions are often bounded, meaning that they cannot accurately model systems with arrival and service rates that are significantly higher or lower than the rest of the distribution.

In the next section, we will explore some of the key properties of heavy-tailed distributions and how they can be used to model queueing systems. We will also discuss some of the challenges and limitations of using heavy-tailed distributions in queueing theory.

## Chapter: Chapter 11: Advanced Topics in Queueing Theory

### Introduction

Queueing theory is a fundamental discipline in the field of computer science and telecommunications. It is a mathematical model used to analyze and optimize systems where customers or jobs arrive, wait in a queue, and are eventually served. In this chapter, we delve deeper into the advanced topics of queueing theory, building upon the foundational concepts covered in earlier chapters.

The chapter begins by exploring the concept of heavy-tailed distributions, a key concept in queueing theory. Heavy-tailed distributions are characterized by long right tails, meaning that there is a higher probability of observing large values. This concept is particularly relevant in queueing theory, as it allows us to model systems where the arrival and service rates are not constant, but can vary significantly over time.

Next, we will discuss the concept of self-similarity, another important concept in queueing theory. Self-similarity refers to the property of a process where the statistical properties of a part of the process are the same as the statistical properties of the whole process. This concept is particularly relevant in queueing theory, as it allows us to model systems where the arrival and service rates are not constant, but can vary significantly over time.

We will then move on to discuss the concept of queueing networks, which are systems where multiple queues are interconnected. Queueing networks are a key concept in queueing theory, as they allow us to model complex systems where customers can move between different queues.

Finally, we will discuss the concept of performance measures in queueing theory. Performance measures are mathematical expressions that provide a quantitative measure of the performance of a queueing system. These measures are crucial in queueing theory, as they allow us to evaluate the performance of a system and identify areas for improvement.

Throughout this chapter, we will use mathematical notation to express these concepts. For example, we might denote the arrival rate as $\lambda$ and the service rate as $\mu$. We will also use the popular Markdown format to present the material, making it easy to read and understand.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a deeper understanding of the advanced topics in queueing theory, and be equipped with the knowledge to apply these concepts to real-world systems.




#### 10.2b Modeling Queueing Systems using Fluid Limit

The fluid limit is a powerful tool for modeling queueing systems, particularly in the Halfin-Whitt regime. It allows us to make predictions about the behavior of queueing systems as the system size approaches infinity, and it provides a framework for understanding the deterministic nature of queue length distributions.

To model a queueing system using the fluid limit, we first need to define the fluid queue. A fluid queue is a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) that describes the evolution of the queue length in the system. The state of the fluid queue is given by the queue length, and the transition rates between different states are determined by the service rates of the servers and the arrival rate of the customers.

The fluid limit of a fluid queue is defined as the limit of the queue length distribution as the system size approaches infinity. This limit is often denoted by the symbol $\rho$, and it is a key parameter in the analysis of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

The fluid limit has several important properties that make it a useful tool for modeling queueing systems. One of these properties is the deterministic nature of the queue length distribution. This property is particularly useful in the context of the Halfin-Whitt regime, where the system is operating at high utilization levels and the system size is often large.

Another important property of the fluid limit is its relationship with the heavy-traffic limit. The fluid limit is often used to approximate the heavy-traffic limit, as it is easier to analyze than the heavy-traffic limit.

The Halfin-Whitt diffusion process is a deterministic function, and it is used to approximate the heavy-traffic limit in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

Another important performance measure in the fluid limit is the response time distribution. The response time distribution describes the time that a customer spends in the system, from arrival to departure. In the fluid limit, the response time distribution is often approximated by the Erlang's loss formula. This formula provides a simple and efficient way to calculate the response time distribution in the fluid limit.

The fluid limit also provides a framework for understanding the stability of queueing systems. A queueing system is said to be stable if the queue length distribution is bounded. In the fluid limit, the stability of a queueing system is often analyzed using the Gordon-Newell theorem. This theorem provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of a queueing system in the fluid limit.

#### 10.3b Modeling Queueing Systems using Heavy-Traffic Limit

The heavy-traffic limit provides a powerful tool for modeling queueing systems, particularly in the Halfin-Whitt regime. In this section, we will discuss how to use the heavy-traffic limit to model queueing systems and derive upper bounds on the queue length and waiting time.

To model a queueing system using the heavy-traffic limit, we first need to define the system in terms of its arrival rate and service rate. The arrival rate, denoted by $\lambda$, is the rate at which customers enter the system, and the service rate, denoted by $\mu$, is the rate at which customers are served. The heavy-traffic limit is then defined as the limit of the system as the arrival rate approaches the service rate, i.e., $\lambda \to \mu$.

In the heavy-traffic limit, the fluid limit provides a deterministic approximation of the queue length distribution. This approximation can be used to analyze the performance of the system.

In the heavy-traffic limit, the queue length can be bounded using the Gordon-Newell theorem. This theorem provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of the system. If the queue length is bounded, then the system is stable.

The waiting time is another important performance measure in the heavy-traffic limit. The waiting time is a measure of the time that a customer spends waiting in the queue. In the heavy-traffic limit, the waiting time can be bounded using the Gordon-Newell theorem. This theorem provides a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of the system. If the waiting time is bounded, then the system is stable.

We have learned that the Halfin-Whitt regime is a regime of heavy traffic, where the system is operating at high utilization levels. In this regime, the queue length distribution is approximately normal, and the system can be modeled using the Halfin-Whitt diffusion. We have also seen how this diffusion process can be used to derive important performance measures, such as the queue length and waiting time.

Furthermore, we have discussed the implications of the Halfin-Whitt regime for queueing systems. We have seen that in this regime, the system is highly sensitive to changes in the arrival rate and service rate. This sensitivity can be exploited to optimize the performance of the system, by adjusting these rates to achieve the desired performance.

In conclusion, the Halfin-Whitt regime is a powerful tool for understanding and analyzing queueing systems. By understanding the principles and applications of this regime, we can design and optimize queueing systems to meet our specific needs and requirements.

## Chapter: Chapter 11: Advanced Topics in Queueing Theory

### Introduction

Queueing theory is a fundamental concept in the field of computer science and telecommunications. It is a mathematical model that describes the behavior of systems in which a sequence of requests or jobs arrive at a service facility and wait in a queue until they can be served. This chapter, "Advanced Topics in Queueing Theory," delves deeper into the intricacies of queueing theory, exploring advanced concepts and applications that are crucial for understanding and optimizing queueing systems.

The chapter begins by discussing the concept of heavy-traffic approximation, a powerful tool used to analyze queueing systems. This approximation is particularly useful in scenarios where the system is operating at high utilization levels, and the queue length is expected to be large. We will explore the mathematical foundations of heavy-traffic approximation, including the assumptions and conditions under which it is applicable.

Next, we will delve into the realm of queueing networks, a more complex form of queueing systems. Queueing networks consist of multiple service facilities and queues, and the arrival and service patterns can be more complex than in single-server queueing systems. We will discuss various types of queueing networks, such as open and closed networks, and explore how to model and analyze these systems using queueing theory.

The chapter will also cover advanced topics such as priority queues, where certain types of jobs are given higher priority over others, and queueing systems with multiple classes of jobs. These topics are particularly relevant in real-world applications, where different types of jobs may have different service requirements and priorities.

Finally, we will touch upon the concept of queueing systems with failures, where the service facility may fail and become unavailable for a certain period of time. This is a critical aspect of queueing theory, as it allows us to model and analyze systems that are subject to failures and uncertainties.

Throughout this chapter, we will use mathematical notation to express key concepts and principles. For example, we might denote the arrival rate of jobs to a queueing system as $\lambda$, and the service rate as $\mu$. We will also use mathematical models and equations to describe the behavior of queueing systems, such as Little's Law, which states that the average queue length in a stable system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time a job spends in the system.

By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of these advanced topics in queueing theory, and be able to apply this knowledge to analyze and optimize queueing systems in a variety of real-world scenarios.




#### 10.3a Definition and Analysis of Diffusion Limit

The diffusion limit is a mathematical concept that is used to describe the behavior of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. It is a powerful tool that allows us to understand the behavior of queueing systems as the system size approaches infinity.

The diffusion limit is defined as the limit of the queue length distribution as the system size approaches infinity. This limit is often denoted by the symbol $\rho$, and it is a key parameter in the analysis of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

The diffusion limit has several important properties that make it a useful tool for modeling queueing systems. One of these properties is the deterministic nature of the queue length distribution. This property is particularly useful in the context of the Halfin-Whitt regime, where the system is operating at high utilization levels and the system size is often large.

Another important property of the diffusion limit is its relationship with the heavy-traffic limit. The diffusion limit is often used to approximate the heavy-traffic limit, as it is easier to analyze than the heavy-traffic limit. This approximation is particularly useful in the context of the Halfin-Whitt regime, where the system is operating at high utilization levels and the system size is often large.

The diffusion limit also has implications for the performance of queueing systems. For instance, it allows us to derive upper bounds on the queue length and waiting time, which are crucial for understanding the behavior of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the analysis of the diffusion limit and explore its implications for queueing systems in more detail.

#### 10.3b Modeling Queueing Systems using Diffusion Limit

The diffusion limit provides a powerful framework for modeling queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. It allows us to understand the behavior of queueing systems as the system size approaches infinity, and it provides insights into the performance of these systems.

To model a queueing system using the diffusion limit, we first need to define the diffusion matrix $L$. This matrix is defined as

$$
L_{i,j}=k(x_i,x_j)
$$

where $k(x_i,x_j)$ is the kernel function that describes the similarity between states $x_i$ and $x_j$. The diffusion matrix $L$ is then used to define the new kernel $L^{(\alpha)}_{i,j}$, where $\alpha$ is a parameter that controls the influence of the diffusion process. This new kernel is defined as

$$
L^{(\alpha)}_{i,j}= \frac{L_{i,j}}{(d(x_i) d(x_j))^{\alpha}}
$$

where $d(x_i)$ is the degree of state $x_i$. The new kernel $L^{(\alpha)}_{i,j}$ is then used to define the diffusion matrix $L^{(\alpha)}$, which is given by

$$
L^{(\alpha)} = D^{-\alpha} L D^{-\alpha}
$$

where $D$ is a diagonal matrix and $D_{i,i} = \sum_j L_{i,j}$. The diffusion matrix $L^{(\alpha)}$ is then used to define the diffusion process, which is given by the transition matrix $M$ of a Markov chain on the state space $X$. The diffusion process is then used to model the queueing system, and the diffusion limit is used to analyze the behavior of the system as the system size approaches infinity.

The diffusion limit provides insights into the performance of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. For instance, it allows us to derive upper bounds on the queue length and waiting time, which are crucial for understanding the behavior of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. In the next section, we will explore these insights in more detail.

#### 10.3c Performance Measures in Diffusion Limit

The diffusion limit provides a powerful tool for analyzing the performance of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. In this section, we will explore some of the key performance measures that can be derived from the diffusion limit.

One of the key performance measures is the queue length distribution. The diffusion limit allows us to derive the queue length distribution as the system size approaches infinity. This distribution provides insights into the behavior of the queueing system, and it can be used to derive upper bounds on the queue length and waiting time.

The queue length distribution is given by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix $M^t$, where $M$ is the transition matrix of the Markov chain on the state space $X$, and $t$ is the time parameter. The eigendecomposition of the matrix $M^t$ yields

$$
M^t_{i,j} = \sum_l \lambda_l^t \psi_l(x_i)\phi_l(x_j)
$$

where $\{\lambda_l \}$ is the sequence of eigenvalues of $M$, and $\{\psi_l \}$ and $\{\phi_l \}$ are the biorthogonal right and left eigenvectors respectively. Due to the spectrum decay of the eigenvalues, only a few terms are necessary to achieve a given relative accuracy in this sum.

Another key performance measure is the waiting time distribution. The diffusion limit allows us to derive the waiting time distribution as the system size approaches infinity. This distribution provides insights into the behavior of the queueing system, and it can be used to derive upper bounds on the queue length and waiting time.

The waiting time distribution is also given by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix $M^t$, where $M$ is the transition matrix of the Markov chain on the state space $X$, and $t$ is the time parameter. The eigendecomposition of the matrix $M^t$ yields

$$
M^t_{i,j} = \sum_l \lambda_l^t \psi_l(x_i)\phi_l(x_j)
$$

where $\{\lambda_l \}$ is the sequence of eigenvalues of $M$, and $\{\psi_l \}$ and $\{\phi_l \}$ are the biorthogonal right and left eigenvectors respectively. Due to the spectrum decay of the eigenvalues, only a few terms are necessary to achieve a given relative accuracy in this sum.

In the next section, we will explore these performance measures in more detail, and we will discuss how they can be used to analyze the behavior of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime.

### Introduction

Queueing theory, a fundamental concept in the field of computer science and telecommunications, is a mathematical model that describes the behavior of systems in which a sequence of requests or jobs arrive at a service facility and wait in a queue until they can be served. In this chapter, we delve deeper into the advanced topics of queueing theory, building upon the foundational knowledge established in previous chapters.

The chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complexities and nuances of queueing theory, equipping readers with the necessary tools to analyze and optimize queueing systems. We will explore various advanced topics, including but not limited to, multi-server queues, priority queues, and queueing networks.

#### 10.4a Definition and Analysis of Stationary Distribution

The stationary distribution of a queueing system is a fundamental concept in queueing theory. It represents the long-term behavior of the system, where the system has reached a steady state and the queue length distribution no longer changes over time. In the context of the Halfin-Whitt regime, the stationary distribution plays a crucial role in understanding the performance of queueing systems.

The stationary distribution of a queueing system is defined as the probability distribution of the queue length at a given time, when the system has reached a steady state. It is denoted by $\pi$, and it satisfies the condition $\pi P = \pi$, where $P$ is the stochastic matrix of the system. This condition implies that $\pi P^n = \pi$ and hence if the Markov chain $(X_n, n \in \mathbb{N})$ has initial distribution $X_0 = \pi$, then $X_n = \pi$ (in distribution) for any $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

In the context of the Halfin-Whitt regime, the stationary distribution is often unique and is given by $\pi_i = \frac{1}{M_i}$, where $M_i = \mathbb{E}(T_i)$ is the mean recurrence time of state $i$. However, if the system has more than one closed communicating class, its stationary distributions will not be unique. Each closed communicating class $C_i$ will have its own unique stationary distribution $\pi_i$, and the set of invariant measures of the original chain is the set of all convex combinations of the $\pi_i$'s.

The stationary distribution also plays a crucial role in the analysis of queueing systems. For instance, it allows us to derive upper bounds on the queue length and waiting time, which are crucial for understanding the behavior of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. Furthermore, the stationary distribution can be used to approximate the performance of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime, providing valuable insights into the behavior of these systems.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the analysis of the stationary distribution and explore its implications for queueing systems in more detail.

#### 10.4b Performance Measures in Stationary Distribution

The stationary distribution of a queueing system provides a wealth of information about the performance of the system. In this section, we will explore some of the key performance measures that can be derived from the stationary distribution.

##### Queue Length Distribution

The queue length distribution, denoted by $L$, is a fundamental performance measure in queueing theory. It represents the probability distribution of the queue length at a given time, when the system has reached a steady state. The queue length distribution can be calculated from the stationary distribution $\pi$ as follows:

$$
L = \pi \mathbf{1}
$$

where $\mathbf{1}$ is a vector of all ones. This equation gives the probability distribution of the queue length at a given time, when the system has reached a steady state.

##### Waiting Time Distribution

The waiting time distribution, denoted by $W$, is another key performance measure in queueing theory. It represents the probability distribution of the waiting time for a job to be served, when the system has reached a steady state. The waiting time distribution can be calculated from the queue length distribution $L$ as follows:

$$
W = L(I - P)^{-1}
$$

where $I$ is the identity matrix and $P$ is the stochastic matrix of the system. This equation gives the probability distribution of the waiting time for a job to be served, when the system has reached a steady state.

##### Utilization

The utilization, denoted by $\rho$, is a measure of the system's load. It represents the proportion of time that the system is busy serving jobs, when the system has reached a steady state. The utilization can be calculated from the stationary distribution $\pi$ as follows:

$$
\rho = \pi P
$$

where $P$ is the stochastic matrix of the system. This equation gives the proportion of time that the system is busy serving jobs, when the system has reached a steady state.

##### Response Time

The response time, denoted by $R$, is a measure of the time a job spends in the system. It represents the average time a job spends in the system, from arrival to departure, when the system has reached a steady state. The response time can be calculated from the waiting time distribution $W$ as follows:

$$
R = W(I - P)^{-1}
$$

where $I$ is the identity matrix and $P$ is the stochastic matrix of the system. This equation gives the average time a job spends in the system, from arrival to departure, when the system has reached a steady state.

These performance measures provide a comprehensive understanding of the system's behavior in the Halfin-Whitt regime. They allow us to analyze the system's performance, identify potential bottlenecks, and make informed decisions about system design and management. In the next section, we will explore some advanced applications of these performance measures in queueing theory.

#### 10.4c Case Studies of Stationary Distribution

In this section, we will explore some case studies that illustrate the application of stationary distribution in queueing theory. These case studies will provide a deeper understanding of the concepts discussed in the previous sections and will help in applying these concepts to real-world scenarios.

##### Case Study 1: Single Server Queue

Consider a single server queueing system where jobs arrive at a rate of $\lambda$ jobs per unit time and are served at a rate of $\mu$ jobs per unit time. The system is in the Halfin-Whitt regime, i.e., $\rho = \frac{\lambda}{\mu} > 1$.

The stationary distribution $\pi$ of this system can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\pi = \frac{1}{\mu} \mathbf{1}
$$

where $\mathbf{1}$ is a vector of all ones. This result shows that the stationary distribution is uniform, i.e., all states have the same probability.

The queue length distribution $L$ can be calculated as:

$$
L = \pi \mathbf{1} = \frac{1}{\mu} \mathbf{1}
$$

This result shows that the queue length distribution is also uniform, i.e., the probability of having a queue of any length is the same.

The waiting time distribution $W$ can be calculated as:

$$
W = L(I - P)^{-1} = \frac{1}{\mu(1 - \rho)} \mathbf{1}
$$

This result shows that the waiting time distribution is exponential, i.e., the probability of waiting for a long time is small.

The utilization $\rho$ can be calculated as:

$$
\rho = \pi P = \frac{\lambda}{\mu} \frac{1}{\mu} \mathbf{1} = \frac{\lambda}{\mu}
$$

This result shows that the utilization is equal to the ratio of the arrival rate to the service rate, as expected.

The response time $R$ can be calculated as:

$$
R = W(I - P)^{-1} = \frac{1}{\mu(1 - \rho)} \mathbf{1}
$$

This result shows that the response time is equal to the waiting time, as there is no queueing delay in this system.

##### Case Study 2: Multi-Server Queue

Consider a multi-server queueing system where jobs arrive at a rate of $\lambda$ jobs per unit time and are served by $N$ servers at a rate of $\mu$ jobs per unit time per server. The system is in the Halfin-Whitt regime, i.e., $\rho = \frac{\lambda}{N \mu} > 1$.

The stationary distribution $\pi$ of this system can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\pi = \frac{1}{N \mu} \mathbf{1}
$$

where $\mathbf{1}$ is a vector of all ones. This result shows that the stationary distribution is uniform, i.e., all states have the same probability.

The queue length distribution $L$ can be calculated as:

$$
L = \pi \mathbf{1} = \frac{1}{N \mu} \mathbf{1}
$$

This result shows that the queue length distribution is also uniform, i.e., the probability of having a queue of any length is the same.

The waiting time distribution $W$ can be calculated as:

$$
W = L(I - P)^{-1} = \frac{1}{N \mu(1 - \rho)} \mathbf{1}
$$

This result shows that the waiting time distribution is exponential, i.e., the probability of waiting for a long time is small.

The utilization $\rho$ can be calculated as:

$$
\rho = \pi P = \frac{\lambda}{N \mu} \frac{1}{N \mu} \mathbf{1} = \frac{\lambda}{N \mu}
$$

This result shows that the utilization is equal to the ratio of the arrival rate to the service rate, as expected.

The response time $R$ can be calculated as:

$$
R = W(I - P)^{-1} = \frac{1}{N \mu(1 - \rho)} \mathbf{1}
$$

This result shows that the response time is equal to the waiting time, as there is no queueing delay in this system.




#### 10.4b Estimating Stationary Distribution in Queueing Systems

Estimating the stationary distribution in queueing systems is a crucial step in understanding the behavior of these systems. As we have seen in the previous section, the stationary distribution provides valuable insights into the performance of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. However, in many practical scenarios, the exact values of the stationary distribution may not be known or may be difficult to compute. In such cases, it is necessary to estimate the stationary distribution.

There are several methods for estimating the stationary distribution in queueing systems. One of the most common methods is the method of moments, which involves equating the moments of the estimated distribution with the moments of the true distribution. This method can be used to estimate the stationary distribution in queueing systems, but it may not always provide accurate results.

Another method for estimating the stationary distribution is the maximum likelihood estimation method. This method involves maximizing the likelihood function, which is defined as the product of the probabilities of the observed events. The maximum likelihood estimate of the stationary distribution is the distribution that maximizes the likelihood function. This method can provide accurate results, but it may be computationally intensive.

In the context of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime, the stationary distribution is often unique and is given by $\pi_i = \frac{1}{M_i}$, where $M_i = \mathbb{E}(T_i)$ is the mean recurrence time of state $i$. In such cases, the stationary distribution can be estimated by computing the mean recurrence times for each state. This method is simple and can provide accurate results, but it may not always be feasible.

In the next section, we will discuss some of these methods in more detail and provide examples of how they can be used to estimate the stationary distribution in queueing systems.

#### 10.4c Applications of Stationary Distribution in Queueing Systems

The stationary distribution of queueing systems plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of these systems. It provides insights into the performance of the system, including the queue length, waiting time, and server utilization. In this section, we will discuss some of the applications of the stationary distribution in queueing systems.

One of the primary applications of the stationary distribution is in the analysis of queueing systems. The stationary distribution can be used to derive upper bounds on the queue length and waiting time, which are crucial for understanding the behavior of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. For instance, the stationary distribution can be used to derive the Erlang's C formula, which provides an upper bound on the probability that an arriving customer is forced to join the queue (all servers are occupied). This formula is often denoted as $P_k = \frac{\lambda^k}{k!} \frac{1}{\mu^k} \frac{1}{(1-\rho)^k}$, where $\lambda$ is the arrival rate, $\mu$ is the service rate, $k$ is the number of servers, and $\rho$ is the traffic intensity.

Another important application of the stationary distribution is in the design and optimization of queueing systems. The stationary distribution can be used to identify bottlenecks in the system and to design strategies for improving the performance of the system. For instance, the stationary distribution can be used to identify the states that contribute the most to the queue length and waiting time. These states can then be targeted for improvement, which can lead to significant improvements in the performance of the system.

In the context of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime, the stationary distribution is often unique and is given by $\pi_i = \frac{1}{M_i}$, where $M_i = \mathbb{E}(T_i)$ is the mean recurrence time of state $i$. This result can be used to approximate the performance of queueing systems in the Halfin-Whitt regime. For instance, the mean queue length can be approximated as $\sum_{i=1}^M \pi_i \mathbb{E}(L_i)$, where $L_i$ is the queue length at state $i$.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the methods for estimating the stationary distribution in queueing systems. These methods are crucial for applying the stationary distribution in the analysis and optimization of queueing systems.

Queueing networks with finite capacity are a type of queueing system where the number of customers in the system is limited by a finite capacity.

We will discuss how the finite capacity can lead to phenomena such as queue overflow, system instability, and the need for queue discipline. We will also explore how these phenomena can be mitigated or exploited to improve the performance of the network.

Finally, we will look at some real-world applications of queueing networks with finite capacity. These applications will illustrate the practical relevance of the concepts and techniques discussed in this chapter, and will provide a glimpse into the richness and diversity of the field of queueing theory.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of queueing networks with finite capacity, their characteristics, and their role in queueing theory. They should also be equipped with the knowledge and tools to analyze and optimize these networks in a variety of contexts.

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamentals of queueing theory, including single-server queues, multi-server queues, and finite-capacity queues. We have also delved into the concept of networks, where multiple queues are interconnected to form a system. In this chapter, we will focus on a specific type of network known as the Open Jackson Network.

The Open Jackson Network is a type of queueing network where customers can enter and exit the system at any point. This makes it a more complex and realistic model compared to the closed networks we have studied earlier. The Open Jackson Network is widely used in various industries, including telecommunication networks, computer systems, and manufacturing processes.

In this chapter, we will first introduce the concept of the Open Jackson Network and discuss its characteristics. We will then delve into the analysis of these networks, including the calculation of performance measures such as average queue length, average waiting time, and average number of customers in the system. We will also explore the stability conditions of these networks and how to determine the optimal number of servers at each queue.

Furthermore, we will discuss the applications of Open Jackson Networks in various industries and how they can be used to improve system performance. We will also touch upon the limitations of this model and potential extensions that can be made to overcome these limitations.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of Open Jackson Networks and their applications. They will also be equipped with the necessary tools to analyze and optimize these networks for real-world scenarios. So, let's dive into the world of Open Jackson Networks and discover the fascinating concepts and applications of this powerful queueing model.




### Section: 11.1 Jackson Networks:

In the previous chapters, we have explored various types of queueing networks, including single-server queues, multi-server queues, and finite-capacity queues. In this chapter, we will focus on a specific type of network known as the Open Jackson Network.

#### 11.1a Definition and Analysis of Jackson Networks

The Open Jackson Network is a type of queueing network where customers can enter and exit the system at any point. This makes it a more complex and realistic model compared to the closed networks we have studied earlier. The Open Jackson Network is widely used in various industries, including telecommunication networks, computer systems, and manufacturing processes.

To analyze the performance of an Open Jackson Network, we use the concept of equilibrium state probability distribution. This distribution gives us the probability of finding a certain number of customers at each queue in the network. In an open Jackson network of "m" M/M/1 queues, the equilibrium state probability distribution exists and is given by the product of the individual queue equilibrium distributions. This result, denoted as $\pi (k_1,k_2,\ldots,k_m) = \prod_{i=1}^{m} \pi_i(k_i)$, also holds for M/M/c model stations with "c"<sub>"i"</sub> servers at the <math>i^\text{th}</math> station, with utilization requirement <math>\rho_i < c_i</math>.

In an open network, jobs arrive from outside following a Poisson process with rate $\alpha>0$. Each arrival is independently routed to node "j" with probability $p_{0j}\ge0$ and $\sum_{j=1}^J p_{0j}=1$. Upon service completion at node "i", a job may go to another node "j" with probability $p_{ij}$ or leave the network with probability $p_{i0}=1-\sum_{j=1}^J p_{ij}$.

The overall arrival rate to node "i", $\lambda_i$, including both external arrivals and internal transitions, can be calculated using the formula $\lambda_i = \alpha p_{0i} + \sum_{j=1}^J \mu_i(x_i) (1-p_{ij})$.

To determine the equilibrium distribution of the number of jobs at each node, we use the balance equations. These equations state that the arrival rate to a node is equal to the departure rate from that node. This can be expressed mathematically as $\lambda_i = \sum_{j=1}^J \lambda_j p_{ji} + \alpha p_{0i}$.

By solving these balance equations, we can determine the equilibrium distribution of the number of jobs at each node in the network. This distribution can then be used to calculate various performance measures, such as the average queue length, average waiting time, and average number of customers in the system.

In the next section, we will explore the applications of Open Jackson Networks in various industries and how they can be used to improve system performance. We will also discuss the limitations of this model and potential extensions that can be made to overcome these limitations.





#### 11.1b Modeling Network Performance using Jackson Networks

In the previous section, we discussed the definition and analysis of Jackson Networks. In this section, we will explore how Jackson Networks can be used to model network performance.

The performance of a network can be measured in various ways, such as the average number of customers in the system, the average waiting time, and the average queue length. These metrics can be used to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of a network.

To model network performance using Jackson Networks, we first need to define the network structure. This includes the number of queues, the service rates, and the routing probabilities. Once the network structure is defined, we can use the equilibrium state probability distribution to calculate the performance metrics.

For example, the average number of customers in the system can be calculated using Little's Law, which states that the average number of customers in the system is equal to the average arrival rate multiplied by the average time a customer spends in the system. This can be expressed mathematically as $\lambda W$, where $\lambda$ is the average arrival rate and $W$ is the average time a customer spends in the system.

The average waiting time can be calculated using the Little's Law formula, where $L$ is the average number of customers in the system, $L$ is the average arrival rate, and $W$ is the average time a customer spends in the system. This can be expressed mathematically as $W = \frac{L}{\lambda}$.

The average queue length can be calculated using the Little's Law formula, where $L$ is the average number of customers in the system, $L$ is the average arrival rate, and $W$ is the average time a customer spends in the system. This can be expressed mathematically as $L = \lambda W$.

By using Jackson Networks to model network performance, we can gain valuable insights into the behavior of the network and make informed decisions to improve its efficiency and effectiveness. This makes Jackson Networks a powerful tool for analyzing and optimizing network performance.





#### 11.2a Definition and Calculation of Routing Probability

Routing probability is a fundamental concept in queueing theory, particularly in the context of open Jackson networks. It is defined as the probability that a customer will be routed to a specific queue or service facility, given that they have entered the network. In other words, it is the probability of taking a specific path in the network.

The routing probability can be calculated using the routing matrix, which is a square matrix that represents the one-step transition probability from one state to another. The routing matrix is defined as $P = (p_{ij})$, where $p_{ij}$ is the probability of transitioning from state $i$ to state $j$.

#### 11.2b Analyzing Routing Probability

After calculating the routing probability, it is important to analyze it to gain insights into the behavior of the queueing system. The analysis of routing probability can be done using various techniques, including the use of queueing networks, Markov chains, and simulation models.

One of the key insights that can be gained from analyzing routing probability is the identification of bottlenecks in the queueing system. Bottlenecks are points in the system where the routing probability is high, indicating that a large number of customers are being routed to these points. These bottlenecks can be potential areas for improvement, as they may be causing delays and inefficiencies in the system.

Another important aspect of analyzing routing probability is understanding the impact of changes in the system on the routing probability. For example, if a new service facility is added to the system, the routing probability may change, affecting the overall performance of the system. By analyzing the routing probability, we can predict these changes and make necessary adjustments to optimize the system.

Furthermore, the analysis of routing probability can also help in identifying potential areas for cost savings. By understanding the routing probability, we can identify points in the system where the traffic is high, and potentially redirect it to less congested areas, leading to cost savings.

In conclusion, the analysis of routing probability is a crucial step in understanding and optimizing queueing systems. It provides valuable insights into the behavior of the system and can help in making informed decisions for improvement and cost savings.
