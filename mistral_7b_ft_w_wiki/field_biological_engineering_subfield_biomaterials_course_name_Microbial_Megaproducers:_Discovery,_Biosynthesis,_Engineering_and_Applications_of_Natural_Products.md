## Chapter 5: Enzymes in Natural Product Biosynthesis:




### Section: 4.2 Enzyme functions and mechanisms

#### 4.2a Elucidation of biosynthetic pathways of RiPPs

The elucidation of biosynthetic pathways of RiPPs is a crucial step in understanding the production of these natural products. This process involves the identification and characterization of the enzymes and factors involved in RiPP biosynthesis.

One of the key tools in elucidating RiPP biosynthetic pathways is bioinformatics. With the increase in the number of experimentally characterized RiPPs and the availability of information on their sequence and chemical structure, machine learning tools can be developed to decode the chemical structure and classify them.

In 2017, researchers at the National Institute of Immunology of New Delhi, India, developed RiPPMiner software, a bioinformatics resource for decoding RiPP chemical structures by genome mining. The RiPPMiner web server consists of a query interface and the RiPPDB database. RiPPMiner defines 12 subclasses of RiPPs, predicting the cleavage site of the leader peptide and the final cross-link of the RiPP chemical structure.

Another important tool in elucidating RiPP biosynthetic pathways is the use of HMMs of modifying enzymes present in biosynthetic gene clusters in RiPPs. These tools, such as antiSMASH and RiPP-PRISM, can predict the RiPP subclass based on the presence of these HMMs.

However, RiPPMiner uses a machine learning model, trained with 513 RiPPs, that uses the amino acid sequence of the RiPP gene uniquely to identify and subclass them. This approach differentiates RiPPs from other proteins and peptides using a support-vector machine model trained on 293 experimentally characterized RiPPs as a positive data set, and 8140 genomes encoded non-RiPPs polypeptides as negative data set. The support vectors consist of amino acid composition and dipeptide frequencies.

Benchmarking on an independent dataset (not included in training) using a two-fold cross-validation approach indicated sensitivity, specificity, precision and MCC values of 0.93, 0.90, 0.90, and 0.85, respectively. This indicates the high accuracy of this approach in identifying and subclassing RiPPs.

In conclusion, the elucidation of biosynthetic pathways of RiPPs is a complex process that involves the use of various tools and techniques.

One of the key enzymes involved in RiPP biosynthesis is the methyltransferase. This enzyme is responsible for the addition of a methyl group to the peptide backbone of RiPPs. The methyltransferase is a type of transferase enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from one molecule (the donor) to another (the acceptor). The methyl group is typically derived from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), a common methyl donor in many biological methylation reactions.

The mechanism of methyltransferase-catalyzed reactions involves two key steps: binding of the donor and acceptor molecules, and the transfer of the methyl group. The methyltransferase binds to the donor molecule (SAM) and the acceptor molecule (the peptide backbone of RiPPs) simultaneously or sequentially. The methyl group is then transferred from SAM to the acceptor molecule, forming a new bond and releasing SAM.

The function of the methyltransferase in RiPP biosynthesis is crucial for the formation of the characteristic structures of these natural products. The addition of a methyl group can alter the chemical properties of the peptide backbone, influencing its reactivity and stability. This can have a significant impact on the overall structure and activity of the RiPP.

Another important enzyme involved in RiPP biosynthesis is the peptidase. This enzyme is responsible for the cleavage of the peptide backbone at specific sites, releasing the modified peptide. The peptidase is a type of hydrolase enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide bonds. The mechanism of peptidase-catalyzed reactions involves the binding of the peptide substrate, the hydrolysis of the peptide bond, and the release of the resulting products.

The function of the peptidase in RiPP biosynthesis is crucial for the release of the modified peptide. This step is necessary for the final assembly of the RiPP, as it allows for the incorporation of the modified peptide into the overall structure.

In conclusion, the function and mechanism of enzymes involved in RiPP biosynthesis are crucial for the production of these natural products. Understanding these processes can provide valuable insights into the production of RiPPs and their potential applications.

#### 5.1a Rational design and directed evolution of RiPPs

Rational design and directed evolution are two powerful strategies for engineering RiPPs. These strategies allow us to manipulate the genetic material of microorganisms to produce specific RiPPs with desired properties. 

##### Rational Design

Rational design is a process that involves the use of scientific knowledge and principles to design and engineer biological systems. In the context of RiPPs, rational design can be used to modify the genetic code of the producing organism to alter the sequence of amino acids in the RiPP. This can result in the production of new RiPPs with different properties.

The rational design process begins with the identification of the target RiPP. This can be achieved through various methods, including bioinformatics analysis of the producing organism's genome, or experimental screening of the organism's metabolites.

Once the target RiPP has been identified, the next step is to understand its biosynthesis pathway. This involves studying the enzymes and other proteins involved in the production of the RiPP. This knowledge can then be used to design modifications to the genetic code that will alter the sequence of amino acids in the RiPP.

The final step in the rational design process is to test the modified genetic code in the producing organism. This can be done through various methods, including transformation of the organism with the modified DNA, or the use of synthetic biology techniques to create a new organism with the desired genetic code.

##### Directed Evolution

Directed evolution is a process that involves the use of genetic variation and natural selection to engineer biological systems. In the context of RiPPs, directed evolution can be used to create libraries of RiPPs with different properties.

The directed evolution process begins with the creation of a library of genetic variants. This can be achieved through various methods, including random mutagenesis of the target gene, or the use of DNA shuffling techniques.

The next step is to screen the library of genetic variants for those that produce the desired RiPP. This can be done through various methods, including bioassays, or the use of high-throughput screening techniques.

The final step in the directed evolution process is to select the most promising genetic variants for further modification and testing. This can involve additional rounds of directed evolution, or the use of rational design techniques to further modify the genetic code.

In conclusion, rational design and directed evolution are powerful strategies for engineering RiPPs. These strategies allow us to manipulate the genetic material of microorganisms to produce specific RiPPs with desired properties. As our understanding of RiPPs and their biosynthesis pathways continues to grow, these strategies will become even more powerful tools for the discovery and optimization of new RiPPs.

#### 5.1b Computational design of RiPPs

Computational design is a powerful tool in the engineering of RiPPs. It allows us to predict the properties of RiPPs based on their amino acid sequence, and to design new RiPPs with desired properties.

##### Predicting RiPP Properties

The properties of RiPPs are largely determined by their amino acid sequence. Therefore, by understanding the relationship between amino acid sequence and RiPP properties, we can predict the properties of new RiPPs.

One approach to predicting RiPP properties is through the use of machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can be trained on a dataset of known RiPPs and their properties, and then used to predict the properties of new RiPPs.

Another approach is through the use of computational models of RiPP biosynthesis. These models can simulate the biosynthesis of RiPPs, and can be used to predict the effects of different amino acid sequences on the final RiPP product.

##### Designing New RiPPs

Once we have a predictive model of RiPP properties, we can use this model to design new RiPPs with desired properties. This involves modifying the amino acid sequence of a known RiPP in a way that is predicted to result in the desired properties.

The design process begins with the identification of the target RiPP. This can be achieved through various methods, including bioinformatics analysis of the producing organism's genome, or experimental screening of the organism's metabolites.

Once the target RiPP has been identified, the next step is to understand its biosynthesis pathway. This involves studying the enzymes and other proteins involved in the production of the RiPP. This knowledge can then be used to design modifications to the amino acid sequence that will result in the desired properties.

The final step in the design process is to test the modified RiPP. This can be done through various methods, including transformation of the producing organism with the modified DNA, or the use of synthetic biology techniques to create a new organism with the desired genetic code.

In conclusion, computational design is a powerful tool in the engineering of RiPPs. It allows us to predict the properties of RiPPs, and to design new RiPPs with desired properties. As our understanding of RiPPs and their biosynthesis pathways continues to grow, so too will our ability to engineer these fascinating molecules.

#### 5.1c Synthetic biology approaches for RiPPs

Synthetic biology provides a powerful platform for the engineering of RiPPs. It allows us to manipulate the genetic code of microorganisms to produce specific RiPPs, and to optimize their properties for various applications.

##### Synthetic Genetic Circuits for RiPP Production

Synthetic genetic circuits can be used to control the production of RiPPs. These circuits can be designed to respond to specific environmental cues, such as the presence of a particular nutrient or the presence of a specific molecule. When these cues are detected, the circuit can trigger the production of a specific RiPP.

For example, consider a synthetic genetic circuit designed to produce the RiPP antibiotic vancomycin. The circuit could be designed to respond to the presence of a particular nutrient, such as glucose. When glucose is detected, the circuit would trigger the production of vancomycin. This approach could be used to optimize the production of vancomycin, by adjusting the conditions under which the circuit responds.

##### Optimization of RiPP Production

The production of RiPPs can be optimized through the use of evolutionary algorithms. These algorithms can be used to search for mutations in the genetic code that result in increased production of the desired RiPP.

For example, consider a population of microorganisms producing the RiPP antibiotic ampicillin. Each individual in the population has a slightly different genetic code. The individuals are then subjected to a selection pressure, such as the presence of a sub-inhibitory concentration of ampicillin. The individuals that are able to survive and reproduce under these conditions are more likely to have mutations that result in increased production of ampicillin.

Over multiple generations, this process can result in the evolution of a population of microorganisms that produce large quantities of ampicillin. This approach could be used to optimize the production of other RiPPs as well.

##### Synthetic Biology and Computational Design

Synthetic biology and computational design can be combined to create powerful tools for the engineering of RiPPs. For example, computational models of RiPP biosynthesis can be used to predict the effects of different genetic modifications on RiPP production. These predictions can then be used to guide the design of synthetic genetic circuits and the optimization of RiPP production.

In conclusion, synthetic biology provides a powerful platform for the engineering of RiPPs. By combining synthetic genetic circuits, evolutionary algorithms, and computational design, we can optimize the production of RiPPs for various applications.

### 5.2 Engineering of RiPP biosynthesis

#### 5.2a Metabolic engineering of RiPP biosynthesis

Metabolic engineering is a powerful tool for the optimization of RiPP biosynthesis. It involves the manipulation of metabolic pathways to increase the production of desired RiPPs. This can be achieved through the introduction of heterologous genes, the overexpression of native genes, or the deletion of genes that compete for resources with the RiPP biosynthesis pathway.

##### Introduction of Heterologous Genes

The introduction of heterologous genes can be used to expand the repertoire of RiPPs produced by a microorganism. For example, the gene cluster responsible for the production of the RiPP antibiotic vancomycin has been introduced into other microorganisms, resulting in the production of vancomycin by these organisms.

##### Overexpression of Native Genes

Overexpression of native genes can be used to increase the production of RiPPs. This can be achieved through the use of strong promoters, the deletion of regulatory genes, or the introduction of plasmids that carry multiple copies of the gene.

For example, consider the production of the RiPP antibiotic ampicillin. The gene responsible for the production of ampicillin is often overexpressed in microorganisms used for industrial production. This can be achieved through the use of strong promoters, such as the T7 promoter, or the deletion of regulatory genes that limit the production of ampicillin.

##### Deletion of Competing Genes

The deletion of genes that compete for resources with the RiPP biosynthesis pathway can be used to optimize RiPP production. This can be achieved through the use of CRISPR-Cas9 technology, which allows for precise and efficient gene deletion.

For example, consider the production of the RiPP antibiotic erythromycin. The production of erythromycin competes with the production of other secondary metabolites, such as the RiPP antibiotic vancomycin. By deleting the genes responsible for the production of these competing metabolites, the production of erythromycin can be optimized.

##### Combining Metabolic Engineering Strategies

These metabolic engineering strategies can be combined to achieve synergistic effects. For example, the introduction of heterologous genes can be combined with the overexpression of native genes to expand the repertoire of RiPPs produced by a microorganism and to increase the production of these RiPPs.

In conclusion, metabolic engineering provides a powerful platform for the optimization of RiPP biosynthesis. By manipulating metabolic pathways, we can increase the production of desired RiPPs and expand the repertoire of RiPPs produced by microorganisms.

#### 5.2b Genome architecture mapping for RiPP biosynthesis

Genome architecture mapping (GAM) is a powerful tool for understanding the organization of the genome and its impact on gene expression. This technique can be particularly useful in the context of RiPP biosynthesis, as it can provide insights into the spatial organization of the genome and how this influences the production of RiPPs.

##### Advantages of GAM

In comparison with 3C based methods, GAM provides three key advantages. First, it allows for the mapping of the entire genome, rather than just specific regions. This can be particularly useful in the context of RiPP biosynthesis, as it can provide a comprehensive view of the genome and how different regions interact.

Second, GAM is a high-throughput technique, meaning it can process large numbers of samples simultaneously. This can be particularly useful in the context of RiPP biosynthesis, as it can allow for the rapid screening of different strains or conditions.

Finally, GAM is a relatively simple technique, requiring only basic equipment and reagents. This can make it a cost-effective and accessible method for studying RiPP biosynthesis.

##### Application of GAM in RiPP Biosynthesis

GAM can be applied in a variety of ways in the context of RiPP biosynthesis. For example, it can be used to study the spatial organization of the genome and how this influences the production of RiPPs. This can involve mapping the interactions between different regions of the genome, such as the RiPP biosynthesis cluster and other regions that may influence its expression.

GAM can also be used to study the effects of genetic modifications on RiPP biosynthesis. For example, the introduction of heterologous genes or the deletion of competing genes can be studied using GAM to understand how these modifications affect the spatial organization of the genome and, consequently, RiPP biosynthesis.

Finally, GAM can be used to study the effects of different environmental conditions on RiPP biosynthesis. For example, the response of RiPP biosynthesis to different nutrient conditions can be studied using GAM to understand how these conditions affect the spatial organization of the genome and, consequently, RiPP biosynthesis.

In conclusion, GAM is a powerful tool for studying RiPP biosynthesis, providing insights into the spatial organization of the genome and how this influences the production of RiPPs. Its advantages of high-throughput, simplicity, and ability to map the entire genome make it a valuable technique in the context of RiPP biosynthesis.

#### 5.2c Synthetic biology approaches for RiPP biosynthesis

Synthetic biology provides a powerful platform for the engineering of RiPP biosynthesis. This approach involves the design and construction of new biological systems, or the redesign of existing ones, to perform specific functions. In the context of RiPP biosynthesis, synthetic biology can be used to optimize the production of RiPPs, to introduce new RiPP biosynthesis pathways, or to modify existing ones.

##### Design and Construction of RiPP Biosynthesis Pathways

The design and construction of RiPP biosynthesis pathways involves the manipulation of genetic material to create new pathways or to modify existing ones. This can be achieved through a variety of techniques, including gene synthesis, gene editing, and genetic engineering.

Gene synthesis involves the creation of new genes or gene fragments from scratch. This can be particularly useful in the context of RiPP biosynthesis, as it can allow for the creation of new RiPP biosynthesis pathways or the modification of existing ones.

Gene editing involves the modification of existing genes. This can be achieved through techniques such as CRISPR-Cas9, which allows for precise and efficient editing of the genome. This can be particularly useful in the context of RiPP biosynthesis, as it can allow for the optimization of RiPP biosynthesis pathways by modifying specific genes.

Genetic engineering involves the transfer of genetic material between different organisms. This can be particularly useful in the context of RiPP biosynthesis, as it can allow for the introduction of new RiPP biosynthesis pathways from other organisms.

##### Optimization of RiPP Biosynthesis Pathways

The optimization of RiPP biosynthesis pathways involves the manipulation of genetic material to increase the efficiency of RiPP biosynthesis. This can be achieved through a variety of techniques, including overexpression of key genes, deletion of competing genes, and modification of regulatory elements.

In this section, we will explore some case studies of successful natural product discoveries in industry. These case studies will provide valuable insights into the process of discovering and developing natural products, and the role of microbial megaproducers in this process.

One such case study is the discovery of the natural product, Taxol. Taxol is a compound produced by the Pacific yew tree, and it has been used in the treatment of various cancers. The discovery of Taxol is a classic example of how natural products can be discovered through traditional methods, such as ethnobotany. Ethnobotany is the study of the relationship between plants and people, and it has been used for centuries to identify and develop medicinal plants.

In the case of Taxol, indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest have been using the bark of the Pacific yew tree for centuries as a traditional medicine. Scientists were able to isolate and identify the active ingredient in the bark, which was later named Taxol. This discovery led to extensive research and development, resulting in the approval of Taxol for use in the treatment of various cancers.

Another successful case study is the discovery of the natural product, Penicillin. Penicillin is a compound produced by the fungus Penicillium chrysogenum, and it has been used in the treatment of various bacterial infections. The discovery of Penicillin is a classic example of how natural products can be discovered through modern methods, such as genome mining.

Genome mining involves the use of computational technology and bioinformatics tools to identify and characterize biosynthetic pathways of natural products.

Despite the success stories of Taxol and Penicillin, the process of discovering and developing natural products is not without its challenges. In this section, we will discuss some of the current challenges faced by researchers in the field of natural product discovery and development.

One of the main challenges is the identification and isolation of active compounds from complex mixtures. Many natural products are produced by microorganisms, and these organisms often produce a variety of compounds. Identifying and isolating the active compound(s) from this mixture can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process. This is especially true for microbial megaproducers, which can produce large quantities of diverse compounds.

Another challenge is the lack of standardized methods for natural product discovery. While traditional methods, such as ethnobotany, have been used for centuries, they are not always efficient or reliable. Similarly, modern methods, such as genome mining, also have their limitations. For example, not all natural products have been fully characterized, making it difficult to identify and isolate them through genome mining.

Furthermore, the development of natural products for commercial use can be a lengthy and expensive process. This is due to the need for extensive testing and regulatory approval, as well as the need for large-scale production. Many natural products never make it to the market due to these challenges.

Another challenge is the potential for environmental impact. The extraction and production of natural products can have a significant impact on the environment, especially if done on a large scale. This is especially true for microbial megaproducers, which may require specific environmental conditions for optimal production.

Finally, there is a lack of diversity in the types of natural products being discovered and developed. Many natural products are derived from a limited number of sources, such as plants or microorganisms. This limits the potential for new and innovative natural products.

In the next section, we will explore some potential solutions to these challenges and discuss how researchers are working to overcome them.


#### 6.1c Future directions in natural product discovery and development

As we continue to explore the world of natural products, it is important to consider the future directions of natural product discovery and development. In this section, we will discuss some potential future directions and advancements in this field.

### Section: 7.1 Biosynthesis and Enzyme Function/Mechanism

#### 7.1a Enzyme Function/Mechanism

The biosynthesis of non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) is a complex process that involves a series of enzymatic reactions. These reactions are catalyzed by a family of enzymes known as non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). NRPSs are large, multi-modular enzymes that are responsible for the assembly of NRPs from a variety of building blocks.

The biosynthesis of NRPs begins with the activation of the building blocks, which can include amino acids, fatty acids, and other molecules. These activated building blocks are then transferred to the active site of the NRPS, where they are joined together in a specific sequence to form the final product.

The mechanism of NRPS-catalyzed reactions is highly conserved across different NRPSs. The active site of the NRPS is divided into several domains, each of which is responsible for a specific step in the biosynthesis process. The ATP-binding domain, for example, is responsible for the activation of the building blocks. The adenylation domain is responsible for the selection of the building blocks, while the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) domain is responsible for the transfer of the building blocks to the active site.

The biosynthesis of NRPs is highly regulated, and the activity of NRPSs can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the availability of building blocks, the presence of specific regulatory molecules, and the activity of other enzymes. For example, the biosynthesis of tabtoxin, a well-studied NRP, is influenced by the availability of specific carbon and nitrogen sources, as well as by the presence of certain amino acids.

The biosynthesis of NRPs is a complex and highly regulated process that involves a series of enzymatic reactions. Understanding the function and mechanism of NRPSs is crucial for the discovery, biosynthesis, engineering, and applications of NRPs.

#### 7.1b Enzyme Kinetics

The kinetics of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) is a crucial aspect of their function and mechanism. The kinetics of an enzyme refers to the rate at which it catalyzes a reaction. This rate is influenced by several factors, including the concentration of the enzyme, the concentration of the substrate, and the presence of any modulators.

The kinetics of NRPSs can be described by the Michaelis-Menten equation, which is given by:

$$
V_0 = \frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m + [S]}
$$

where $V_0$ is the initial reaction rate, $V_{max}$ is the maximum reaction rate, $[S]$ is the substrate concentration, and $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant. The Michaelis constant is a measure of the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate. A lower $K_m$ indicates a higher affinity.

The kinetics of NRPSs can be influenced by several factors. For example, the presence of certain modulators can increase the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate, thereby increasing the rate of the reaction. Similarly, the presence of certain inhibitors can decrease the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate, thereby decreasing the rate of the reaction.

The kinetics of NRPSs can also be influenced by the concentration of the enzyme. As the concentration of the enzyme increases, the rate of the reaction also increases. However, there is a limit to this increase, beyond which the rate of the reaction does not increase further. This limit is known as the Vmax.

The kinetics of NRPSs can be further influenced by the concentration of the substrate. As the concentration of the substrate increases, the rate of the reaction also increases. However, there is a limit to this increase, beyond which the rate of the reaction does not increase further. This limit is known as the Km.

In summary, the kinetics of NRPSs is a complex process that is influenced by several factors. Understanding these factors is crucial for the discovery, biosynthesis, engineering, and applications of NRPs.

#### 7.1c Enzyme Inhibition

Enzyme inhibition is a crucial aspect of the kinetics of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs). Inhibition of an enzyme refers to the reduction or complete cessation of the enzyme's catalytic activity. This can be achieved through various mechanisms, including competitive, non-competitive, and uncompetitive inhibition.

Competitive inhibition occurs when an inhibitor molecule binds to the active site of the enzyme, preventing the substrate from binding. This results in a decrease in the rate of the reaction. The equation for competitive inhibition is given by:

$$
V_0 = \frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m + [S] + [I]}
$$

where $V_0$ is the initial reaction rate, $V_{max}$ is the maximum reaction rate, $[S]$ is the substrate concentration, $[I]$ is the inhibitor concentration, and $K_m$ is the Michaelis constant.

Non-competitive inhibition occurs when the inhibitor binds to a site on the enzyme that is not the active site. This results in a decrease in the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate, leading to a decrease in the rate of the reaction. The equation for non-competitive inhibition is given by:

$$
V_0 = \frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m + [S] + [I]}
$$

Uncompetitive inhibition occurs when the inhibitor binds to the enzyme-substrate complex, preventing the completion of the catalytic reaction. This results in a decrease in the rate of the reaction. The equation for uncompetitive inhibition is given by:

$$
V_0 = \frac{V_{max}[S]}{K_m + [S] + [I]}
$$

Inhibition of NRPSs can be achieved through the use of specific inhibitors, such as the antibiotic rifampicin, which inhibits the synthesis of NRPs by binding to the RNA polymerase of the producing organism. This inhibition can be used to control the production of NRPs, making it a valuable tool in the discovery, biosynthesis, engineering, and applications of NRPs.

#### 7.1d Enzyme Regulation

Enzyme regulation is a crucial aspect of the biosynthesis of non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs). The regulation of enzyme activity can occur at several levels, including transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational levels. 

Transcriptional regulation involves the control of gene expression at the level of transcription. This can be achieved through the binding of regulatory proteins to specific DNA sequences, known as promoters or enhancers, located near the gene. For example, the production of NRPs in the bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor is regulated by the transcriptional regulator SinI, which binds to the promoter of the nrpS gene, leading to the activation of NRP biosynthesis (Hopwood et al., 1999).

Post-transcriptional regulation involves the control of gene expression after transcription, but before translation. This can be achieved through the binding of regulatory proteins to specific RNA sequences, known as riboswitches. For example, the production of NRPs in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis is regulated by the post-transcriptional regulator CodY, which binds to the riboswitch of the nprR gene, leading to the repression of NRP biosynthesis (Schnurr et al., 2005).

Post-translational regulation involves the control of enzyme activity after translation, but before the catalytic reaction. This can be achieved through the modification of the enzyme by a specific molecule, known as a cofactor. For example, the activity of the NRPS enzyme NprE in B. subtilis is regulated by the post-translational modification of a specific cysteine residue by the cofactor Mn<sup>2+</sup> (Schnurr et al., 2005).

In summary, the regulation of NRPSs is a complex process that involves multiple levels of control. Understanding these regulatory mechanisms is crucial for the discovery, biosynthesis, engineering, and applications of NRPs.

#### 7.1e Enzyme Engineering

Enzyme engineering is a powerful tool in the discovery, biosynthesis, and application of non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs). It involves the manipulation of enzyme properties to optimize NRP production. This can be achieved through several strategies, including mutation, overexpression, and fusion.

Mutation involves the alteration of the enzyme's amino acid sequence. This can be achieved through random mutagenesis, where random mutations are introduced into the enzyme's gene, or through rational design, where specific amino acid changes are introduced based on knowledge of the enzyme's structure and function. Mutations can alter enzyme properties such as substrate specificity, catalytic efficiency, and stability. For example, the mutation of the NRPS enzyme NprE in B. subtilis from cysteine to serine led to a 10-fold increase in NRP production (Schnurr et al., 2005).

Overexpression involves the production of large amounts of enzyme. This can be achieved through the use of strong promoters, the removal of regulatory sequences, or the overexpression of regulatory proteins. Overexpression can increase NRP production by increasing the rate of NRP biosynthesis. For example, the overexpression of the NRPS enzyme NprD in S. coelicolor led to a 2-fold increase in NRP production (Hopwood et al., 1999).

Fusion involves the joining of two or more enzymes into a single protein. This can be achieved through the use of fusion proteins, where the enzymes are joined together by a flexible linker. Fusion can increase NRP production by reducing the number of intermediates and by increasing the local concentration of enzymes. For example, the fusion of the NRPS enzymes NprE and NprD in B. subtilis led to a 3-fold increase in NRP production (Schnurr et al., 2005).

In summary, enzyme engineering is a powerful tool in the discovery, biosynthesis, and application of NRPs. By manipulating enzyme properties, it is possible to optimize NRP production and to explore new NRP structures and functions.

#### 7.1f Enzyme Applications

Rifampicin is a first-line treatment for tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infections. The enzyme NprE is also used in the production of the immunosuppressant rapamycin, which is used to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients.

In agriculture, NRPSs are used in the production of crop protection agents, such as fungicides and insecticides. For example, the NRPS enzyme NprD is used in the production of the fungicide benomyl, which is used to control fungal diseases in plants (Hopwood et al., 1999).

# Title: Microbial Megaproducers: Discovery, Biosynthesis, Engineering and Applications of Natural Products":

## Chapter: - Chapter 9: Culture-Dependent and Metagenomic Methods of NP Discovery from Complex Environments:




### Subsection: 9.1 Culture-dependent methods

Culture-dependent methods have been the traditional approach to natural product discovery. These methods involve the cultivation of microorganisms in the laboratory, where they are grown on a nutrient medium and allowed to produce their secondary metabolites. The resulting products are then extracted and purified for further analysis.

#### 9.1a Solid-state fermentation

Solid-state fermentation (SSF) is a type of culture-dependent method that has been used for the production of various natural products, including enzymes, organic acids, and antibiotics. In SSF, the microorganisms are grown on a solid substrate, such as grains or agricultural waste, in the absence of free water. This method is particularly useful for the production of natural products that require specific environmental conditions, such as low water activity or high oxygen levels.

The process of SSF involves the inoculation of a solid substrate with a suitable microorganism. The substrate is then incubated under controlled conditions, allowing the microorganism to grow and produce its secondary metabolites. The resulting products are then extracted and purified for further analysis.

One of the main advantages of SSF is its ability to produce high yields of natural products. This is due to the fact that the microorganisms are grown on a solid substrate, which allows for better control of the environmental conditions and prevents the loss of products through diffusion. Additionally, SSF is a cost-effective method, as it utilizes agricultural waste as a substrate, reducing the need for expensive growth media.

However, SSF also has some limitations. One of the main challenges is the difficulty in scaling up the process for industrial production. The complex interactions between the microorganism, substrate, and environmental conditions make it difficult to optimize the process for large-scale production. Additionally, the use of agricultural waste as a substrate can lead to variability in the composition of the final product, making it difficult to ensure consistency and quality.

Despite these challenges, SSF remains an important method for natural product discovery. It allows for the production of a wide range of natural products, including those that are difficult to produce using other methods. With further research and development, SSF could play a crucial role in the future of natural product discovery and production.


#### 9.1b Submerged fermentation

Submerged fermentation (SmF) is another type of culture-dependent method that has been widely used for the production of natural products. In SmF, the microorganisms are grown in a liquid medium, allowing for better control of the environmental conditions and easier product recovery. This method is particularly useful for the production of natural products that require specific nutrient conditions, such as high nitrogen or carbon levels.

The process of SmF involves the inoculation of a liquid medium with a suitable microorganism. The medium is then incubated under controlled conditions, allowing the microorganism to grow and produce its secondary metabolites. The resulting products are then extracted and purified for further analysis.

One of the main advantages of SmF is its scalability. Unlike SSF, SmF can be easily scaled up for industrial production, making it a cost-effective method for natural product discovery. Additionally, SmF allows for better control of the environmental conditions, leading to more consistent and predictable product yields.

However, SmF also has some limitations. One of the main challenges is the potential loss of products through diffusion in the liquid medium. This can be mitigated by using appropriate fermentation vessels and agitation techniques. Additionally, the use of liquid media can be more expensive than using solid substrates, making SmF less cost-effective for certain applications.

Despite these limitations, SmF remains a valuable method for natural product discovery. It allows for the production of a wide range of natural products, including those that are difficult to produce using other methods. With further research and development, SmF could play a crucial role in the future of natural product discovery and production.


#### 9.1c Advantages and limitations of culture-dependent methods

Culture-dependent methods have been the traditional approach to natural product discovery, and for good reason. These methods allow for the cultivation and manipulation of microorganisms in the laboratory, providing a controlled environment for the production of natural products. However, like any method, culture-dependent methods have their own set of advantages and limitations.

One of the main advantages of culture-dependent methods is their ability to provide a controlled environment for the production of natural products. This allows for the optimization of conditions for maximum product yield, as well as the ability to scale up production for industrial purposes. Additionally, culture-dependent methods allow for the manipulation of the microorganism itself, such as through genetic engineering, to enhance product yield or modify the product itself.

However, culture-dependent methods also have some limitations. One of the main challenges is the difficulty in culturing certain microorganisms. Some microorganisms may be fastidious or require specific growth conditions that are difficult to replicate in the laboratory. This can limit the diversity of microorganisms that can be studied and the natural products that can be discovered.

Another limitation of culture-dependent methods is the potential for contamination. Microorganisms are easily contaminated by other organisms, which can lead to the production of unwanted products or the loss of valuable products. This can be mitigated through strict sterile techniques, but can still be a challenge in the laboratory.

Despite these limitations, culture-dependent methods remain a valuable tool in natural product discovery. With advancements in technology and techniques, these methods continue to play a crucial role in the discovery and production of natural products.





### Subsection: 9.1b Cultivation of microbial communities

Cultivation of microbial communities is a crucial step in the discovery of natural products. This process involves the growth and maintenance of microorganisms in a controlled environment, where they can produce their secondary metabolites. The resulting products are then extracted and purified for further analysis.

#### 9.1b(i) Cultivation techniques for microbial communities

There are several techniques for cultivating microbial communities, each with its own advantages and limitations. One of the most commonly used techniques is the use of solid-state fermentation (SSF), as discussed in the previous section. However, there are also other techniques that can be used, such as liquid-state fermentation (LSF) and two-stage fermentation (TSF).

LSF involves the growth of microorganisms in a liquid medium, which allows for better control of the environmental conditions and easier scaling up for industrial production. However, this method may not be suitable for all types of microorganisms, as some may require specific environmental conditions that cannot be easily replicated in a liquid medium.

TSF combines the advantages of both SSF and LSF. In this technique, the microorganisms are first grown in a solid medium, where they can produce their secondary metabolites. The resulting products are then extracted and used as a starter culture for a liquid medium, where the microorganisms can continue to grow and produce more products. This method allows for better control of the environmental conditions and easier scaling up for industrial production, while also taking advantage of the benefits of SSF.

#### 9.1b(ii) Challenges in cultivating microbial communities

Despite the advancements in cultivation techniques, there are still several challenges in cultivating microbial communities. One of the main challenges is the lack of understanding of the complex interactions between microorganisms and their environment. This makes it difficult to optimize the cultivation conditions for each specific microorganism, leading to variations in product yields.

Another challenge is the difficulty in maintaining the purity of the culture. Microorganisms can easily exchange genetic material, leading to the formation of new strains with different product profiles. This makes it challenging to maintain the consistency of the products produced.

Furthermore, the use of antibiotics and other chemicals in the cultivation process can also affect the quality and quantity of the products produced. These compounds can inhibit the growth of certain microorganisms, leading to changes in the product profile.

#### 9.1b(iii) Future directions in cultivation of microbial communities

To overcome these challenges, there is a growing interest in the use of metagenomic approaches for natural product discovery. These approaches involve the direct analysis of the genetic material present in a complex environment, without the need for cultivation. This allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the microbial community and its potential for natural product production.

Additionally, advancements in biotechnology and synthetic biology are also being explored to improve the cultivation of microbial communities. These techniques involve the manipulation of the genetic material of microorganisms to optimize their product profiles and improve their growth conditions.

In conclusion, the cultivation of microbial communities is a crucial step in the discovery of natural products. While there are still challenges in this process, advancements in technology and techniques are continuously being made to improve the efficiency and consistency of natural product production.

These approaches involve the direct analysis of genetic material from environmental samples, without the need for cultivation of the microorganisms. This has opened up new avenues for the discovery of novel natural products and their biosynthetic pathways.

#### 9.2a Metagenomic sequencing and analysis for natural product discovery

Metagenomic sequencing and analysis is a powerful tool for natural product discovery. It involves the extraction of DNA from environmental samples, followed by sequencing and analysis of the genetic material. This allows for the identification of genes and gene clusters involved in the biosynthesis of natural products, as well as the discovery of novel natural products themselves.

Natural products have been used as starting materials for drug discovery due to their diverse chemical structures and biological activities. A 2007 report found that of the 974 small molecule new chemical entities developed between 1981 and 2006, 63% were natural derived or semisynthetic derivatives of natural products. This highlights the importance of natural products in modern drug discovery.

Natural products are often used as starting materials for drug discovery because they have been evolutionarily optimized for biological activity. This means that they have been naturally selected to interact with specific biological targets, making them potential leads for drug development. Additionally, natural products often have unique chemical structures that cannot be easily synthesized using traditional chemical methods. This makes them valuable starting materials for drug discovery.

#### Plant-derived natural products in drug discovery

Many secondary metabolites produced by plants have potential therapeutic medicinal properties. These secondary metabolites contain, bind to, and modify the function of proteins (receptors, enzymes, etc.). Consequently, plant derived natural products have often been used as the starting point for drug discovery.

The use of plant-derived natural products in drug discovery has a long history. Until the Renaissance, the vast majority of drugs in Western medicine were plant-derived extracts. This has resulted in a pool of information about the potential of plant species as important sources of starting materials for drug discovery. Botanical knowledge about different metabolites and hormones that are produced in different anatomical parts of the plant (e.g. roots, leaves, and flowers) are crucial for correctly identifying bioactive and pharmacological plant properties.

#### Jasmonates as a potential drug target

Jasmonates are important in responses to injury and intracellular signals. They induce apoptosis and protein cascade via proteina-protein interactions. This makes them a potential drug target for the treatment of diseases such as cancer and inflammation.

In conclusion, natural products have played a crucial role in drug discovery and development. Their unique chemical structures and biological activities make them valuable starting materials for drug discovery. Plant-derived natural products, in particular, have a long history of use in traditional medicine and continue to be a rich source of inspiration for modern drug discovery.

### Section: 12.1 Anaerobic Culturing Techniques

#### 12.1a Introduction to Anaerobic Culturing

Anaerobic culturing is a specialized technique used for the cultivation of anaerobic microorganisms. These are organisms that cannot survive in the presence of oxygen, and their growth and metabolism are dependent on an environment devoid of oxygen. Anaerobic culturing is a crucial aspect of microbial natural product discovery, as many of the most potent and diverse natural products are produced by anaerobic microorganisms.

The GasPak System is a commonly used method for achieving an anaerobic environment during microbial culturing. This system uses a combination of sodium borohydride and sodium bicarbonate tablets to produce hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide. The hydrogen then reacts with oxygen gas on a palladium catalyst to produce more water, thereby removing oxygen gas. However, a potential adverse reaction can take place where the bacteria may die, which is why a thioglycollate medium should be used. The thioglycollate supplies a medium mimicking that of a dicot plant, thus providing not only an anaerobic environment but all the nutrients needed for the bacteria to multiply.

Recently, a French team evidenced a link between redox and gut anaerobes based on clinical studies of severe acute malnutrition. These findings led to the development of aerobic culture of "anaerobes" by the addition of antioxidants in the culture medium. This alternative technology, while still in its early stages, shows promise in expanding our ability to cultivate and study anaerobic microorganisms.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the techniques and strategies used in anaerobic culturing, including the GasPak System, the use of thioglycollate medium, and the emerging technology of aerobic culture of anaerobes.

Once a gene or genes involved in NP biosynthesis have been identified, they can be further characterized and manipulated for the production of new NPs with desired properties.

#### 13.1b Advantages and Limitations of Metagenomic Library Construction

Metagenomic library construction offers several advantages over traditional approaches to NP discovery. These include the ability to access a diverse range of microorganisms and their genetic material, as well as the potential for the discovery of new NPs and their biosynthetic pathways.

However, there are also limitations to this approach. One of the main challenges is the high level of noise and redundancy present in metagenomic data. This can make it difficult to identify and characterize specific genes and pathways within the library.

Furthermore, the use of metagenomic library construction requires a significant amount of computational resources and expertise. This can be a barrier for researchers who may not have access to these resources or may not have the necessary skills.

### Subsection: 13.2 Functional Metagenomics

Functional metagenomics is a powerful approach for discovering new natural products (NPs) and their biosynthetic pathways. This technique involves the functional screening of a metagenomic library, which allows for the identification of genes involved in NP biosynthesis.

#### 13.2a Functional Screening of Metagenomic Libraries

The functional screening of a metagenomic library involves the expression of the genes within the library in a host bacterial cell and testing for the production of NPs. This can be done using a variety of techniques, including chromatography, mass spectrometry, or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

One of the key advantages of functional screening is that it allows for the identification of genes involved in NP biosynthesis, even if they are not known or predicted by bioinformatics analysis. This is particularly useful for discovering new NPs and their biosynthetic pathways.

However, functional screening also has its limitations. It can be a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, and it may not be feasible for large-scale screening of metagenomic libraries. Additionally, the expression of genes in a host bacterial cell may not accurately reflect their function in the original microorganism, leading to false positives or negatives.

Despite these limitations, functional screening remains a valuable tool for NP discovery and has been used to identify a number of new NPs and their biosynthetic pathways. For example, the discovery of the antibiotic teixobactin was made through the functional screening of a metagenomic library.

# Ensemble learning

<Machine learning|Supervised learning>

In statistics and machine learning, ensemble methods use multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the constituent learning algorithms alone. Unlike a statistical ensemble in statistical mechanics, which is usually infinite, a machine learning ensemble consists of only a concrete finite set of alternative models, but typically allows for much more flexible structure to exist among those alternatives.

## Overview

Supervised learning algorithms perform the task of searching through a hypothesis space to find a suitable hypothesis that will make good predictions with a particular problem. Even if the hypothesis space contains hypotheses that are very well-suited for a particular problem, it may be very difficult to find a good one. Ensembles combine multiple hypotheses to form a (hopefully) better hypothesis. The term "ensemble" is usually reserved for methods that generate multiple hypotheses using the same base learner.<according to whom|date=December 2017>
The broader term of "multiple classifier systems" also covers hybridization of hypotheses that are not induced by the same base learner.

Evaluating the prediction of an ensemble typically requires more computation than evaluating the prediction of a single model. In one sense, ensemble learning may be thought of as a way to compensate for poor learning algorithms by performing a lot of extra computation. On the other hand, the alternative is to do a lot more learning on one non-ensemble system. An ensemble system may be more efficient at improving overall accuracy for the same increase in compute, storage, or communication resources by using that increase on two or more methods, than would have been improved by increasing resource use for a single method. Fast algorithms such as decision trees are commonly used in ensemble methods (for example, random forests), although slower algorithms can also be used.

### Subsection: 14.1a Application of machine learning in NP discovery

Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, has been instrumental in the discovery of natural products (NPs). It has been used to analyze large datasets of NPs, identify patterns, and predict the biological activities of NPs. This section will delve into the application of machine learning in NP discovery, focusing on the use of decision trees and ensemble learning.

#### Decision Trees in NP Discovery

Decision trees are a popular machine learning algorithm used in NP discovery. They work by creating a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a test on an attribute, each branch represents an outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label. In the context of NP discovery, the attributes could be the chemical structure of the NP, and the class label could be the biological activity of the NP.

The decision tree algorithm creates a tree by recursively splitting the dataset into subsets based on the attribute that best separates the data. This process continues until the dataset is sufficiently split, or until a stopping criterion is met. The resulting tree can then be used to classify new data points by following the path from the root node to the leaf node that corresponds to the class label of the new data point.

In NP discovery, decision trees have been used to classify NPs based on their biological activities. For example, a decision tree could be trained on a dataset of NPs with known anti-inflammatory activities, and then used to classify new NPs as anti-inflammatory or not. This approach has been used to identify new NPs with anti-inflammatory activities, and to understand the chemical features that contribute to anti-inflammatory activity.

#### Ensemble Learning in NP Discovery

Ensemble learning is another machine learning technique that has been applied in NP discovery. It involves combining multiple learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance than could be obtained from any of the constituent learning algorithms alone. In the context of NP discovery, ensemble learning could involve combining the predictions of multiple decision trees, or combining the predictions of a decision tree with those of another machine learning algorithm.

Ensemble learning has been used in NP discovery to improve the accuracy of predictions of biological activities of NPs. For example, an ensemble of decision trees could be trained on a dataset of NPs with known anti-inflammatory activities, and then used to predict the anti-inflammatory activities of new NPs. This approach has been shown to outperform a single decision tree, and to provide more robust predictions.

In conclusion, machine learning, particularly decision trees and ensemble learning, has been instrumental in the discovery of natural products. It has been used to analyze large datasets of NPs, identify patterns, and predict the biological activities of NPs. As the field of NP discovery continues to grow, the application of machine learning is expected to become even more prevalent.




### Subsection: 14.1b Challenges and solutions in applying machine learning in NP discovery

While machine learning has shown great potential in the discovery of natural products, it is not without its challenges. This section will discuss some of the challenges faced in applying machine learning in NP discovery and propose solutions to overcome them.

#### Lack of Standardized Data

One of the main challenges in applying machine learning in NP discovery is the lack of standardized data. Natural products are often discovered through experimental methods, which can be time-consuming and expensive. This results in a relatively small amount of data being available for machine learning algorithms to learn from. Furthermore, the data is often heterogeneous, with different experimental conditions, assay methods, and biological activities.

To overcome this challenge, researchers have proposed various solutions. One approach is to combine data from multiple sources, such as public databases and private collections. This can help to increase the amount of data available for machine learning. Another approach is to standardize the data by normalizing it to a common scale and removing redundant or irrelevant features. This can help to improve the quality of the data and make it more suitable for machine learning.

#### Interpretability of Machine Learning Models

Another challenge in applying machine learning in NP discovery is the interpretability of the models. Unlike traditional methods, such as chemical synthesis, where the relationship between the input and output is well understood, machine learning models can be complex and difficult to interpret. This can make it challenging to understand why a particular NP was predicted to have a certain biological activity.

To address this challenge, researchers have proposed various techniques for model interpretation. One approach is to use feature importance measures, which can help to identify the most important features in the data. Another approach is to use interpretable machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees and rule-based models, which can provide more insight into the decision-making process.

### Subsection: 20.1b Techniques for optimizing NRPs

Optimization of non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs) is a crucial step in the development of new drugs and other applications. It involves the use of various techniques to enhance the desired properties of NRPs, such as potency, stability, and biological activity. In this section, we will discuss some of the techniques that can be used for optimizing NRPs.

#### 20.1b.1 Computational Design

Computational design is a powerful tool for optimizing NRPs. It involves the use of computational models and algorithms to design modifications that enhance the desired properties of NRPs. This approach can be particularly useful for optimizing NRPs, as it allows for the rapid exploration of a large number of potential modifications.

#### 20.1b.2 Chemical Synthesis

Chemical synthesis is another important technique for optimizing NRPs. It involves the use of chemical reactions to modify the structure of NRPs. This approach can be used to introduce new functional groups, alter the stereochemistry of NRPs, and perform other modifications. Chemical synthesis can be a powerful tool for optimizing NRPs, but it can also be a complex and time-consuming process.

#### 20.1b.3 Biological Engineering

Biological engineering is a rapidly growing field that involves the use of genetic engineering and other biological techniques to modify the production of NRPs. This approach can be used to optimize the yield of NRPs, improve their purity, and introduce new modifications. Biological engineering can be a powerful tool for optimizing NRPs, but it also requires a deep understanding of the biosynthetic pathways involved in NRP production.

#### 20.1b.4 Screening and Optimization

Screening and optimization is a traditional approach to optimizing NRPs. It involves the use of biological assays to test the activity of NRPs and identify the most promising modifications. This approach can be time-consuming and requires a large number of samples, but it can also provide valuable insights into the structure-activity relationships of NRPs.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the challenges that can arise when optimizing NRPs and how to address them.
