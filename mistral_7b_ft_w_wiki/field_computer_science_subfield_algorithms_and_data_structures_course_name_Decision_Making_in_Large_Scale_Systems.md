## Foreward

Welcome to "Decision Making in Large Scale Systems: A Comprehensive Guide". This book aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of decision making in ultra-large-scale systems (ULSS). As we delve into the complexities of ULSS, it is crucial to acknowledge the fundamental gaps in our current understanding of software and software development at this scale. These gaps present profound impediments to the technically and economically effective achievement of significant gains in core system functionality.

The book is structured around the Northrop report's proposed research agenda for ULSS, which includes areas such as human interaction, computational emergence, and socio-technical ecosystems. These areas are strategic, not tactical, and require a broad new conception of both the nature of such systems and new ideas for how to develop them. 

In the realm of human interaction, we will explore the key role of people in ULSS. Many problems in complex systems today stem from failures at the individual and organizational level. Understanding ULSS behavior will depend on the view that humans are elements of a socially constituted computational process. This research involves anthropologists, sociologists, and social scientists conducting detailed socio-technical analyses of user interactions in the field, with the goal of understanding how to construct and evolve such socio-technical systems effectively.

Computational emergence is another critical area of focus. ULSS must satisfy the needs of participants at multiple levels of an organization. These participants will often behave opportunistically to meet their own objectives. Some aspects of ULSS will be "programmed" by properly incentivizing and constraining behavior rather than by explicitly prescribing. This research area explores the use of methods and tools based on economic principles and game theory to design and manage ULSS.

Finally, we will delve into the concept of socio-technical ecosystems. This area challenges us to look at ULSS not just as systems or systems of systems, but as socio-technical ecosystems. We will face fundamental challenges in the design and evolution, orchestration and control, and monitoring and assessment of ULSS. These challenges require breakthrough research.

This book is designed to be a comprehensive guide for advanced undergraduate students at MIT, providing a deep understanding of decision making in large scale systems. It is our hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for those seeking to understand and contribute to the field of ULSS.

Welcome to the journey of understanding and exploring the fascinating world of decision making in large scale systems.

### Subsection 1.1a: Definition of Large Scale Systems

Large scale systems, also known as ultra-large-scale systems (ULSS), are complex systems that involve a large number of components and interactions. These systems are characterized by their size, complexity, and the impact they have on society. They are not limited to a specific domain or industry, but can be found in various fields such as transportation, healthcare, and finance.

The term ULSS was first introduced in a 2006 report from the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. The report highlighted the growing trend of software systems reaching unprecedented scales, and the need for a new approach to engineering and managing these systems. It argued that traditional approaches would no longer be adequate, and that a socio-technical ecosystem approach was necessary.

In 2013, Linda Northrop and her team conducted a talk to review the outcome of the 2006 study and the reality of 2013. The talk concluded that ULSS are in the midst of society, and their changes have significant impacts on current social fabric and institutions. It also highlighted the need for a more conservative approach in the 2006 report, and the exacerbation of the pace of scale growth due to recent technologies.

The concept of ULSS is closely related to the Large-scale Complex IT Systems (LSCITS) research and training initiative in the UK. Both initiatives recognize the challenges of managing and decision making in large scale systems, and the need for a new approach.

In the next section, we will explore the characteristics of large scale systems and the challenges they pose for decision making. We will also discuss the different types of decisions that need to be made in these systems, and the techniques and tools that can aid in the decision-making process.





### Subsection 1.2a: Importance of Decision Making in Large Scale Systems

Decision making is a crucial aspect of managing large scale systems. It involves the process of selecting a course of action from a set of alternatives, based on the available information and constraints. In the context of large scale systems, decision making is essential for ensuring the smooth functioning of the system and achieving its objectives.

One of the key reasons why decision making is important in large scale systems is because of the complexity and scale of these systems. Large scale systems involve a large number of components and interactions, making it difficult to manage and control them. This complexity can lead to unexpected outcomes and challenges, making it necessary to make decisions that can effectively address these issues.

Moreover, large scale systems often have a significant impact on society. For example, transportation systems, healthcare systems, and financial systems all play a crucial role in our daily lives. The decisions made in these systems can have a direct impact on the lives of individuals and the overall functioning of society. Therefore, it is essential to make decisions that are not only effective for the system, but also ethical and responsible towards society.

Another important aspect of decision making in large scale systems is the need for collaboration and coordination. These systems often involve multiple stakeholders, including engineers, managers, and policymakers. Each stakeholder may have their own goals and objectives, making it necessary to make decisions that balance the interests of all parties involved. This requires effective communication and collaboration among stakeholders, which is crucial for the success of large scale systems.

Furthermore, decision making in large scale systems is often a continuous process. As these systems are constantly evolving and facing new challenges, decisions need to be made on a regular basis. This requires a systematic approach to decision making, where decisions are made based on a set of principles and criteria. This not only ensures consistency and transparency, but also allows for adaptability and flexibility in the face of changing circumstances.

In conclusion, decision making is a critical aspect of managing large scale systems. It is essential for addressing the complexity and scale of these systems, ensuring their ethical and responsible functioning, and promoting collaboration and coordination among stakeholders. In the following sections, we will explore the different types of decisions that need to be made in large scale systems, and the techniques and tools that can aid in the decision-making process.

## Chapter 2: Decision Making Under Uncertainty




### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we introduced the concept of decision making and its importance in large-scale systems. We discussed how decisions made at one level can have a cascading effect on the entire system, and how understanding these effects is crucial for making informed decisions. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic of decision making and explore the concept of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs).

MDPs are a mathematical framework used to model and analyze decision-making processes in large-scale systems. They are based on the principles of Markov, a Russian mathematician who developed the concept of a stochastic process. MDPs are widely used in various fields, including engineering, economics, and computer science, to make optimal decisions in complex systems.

In this chapter, we will cover the basics of MDPs, including their definition, key components, and properties. We will also discuss the different types of MDPs, such as discrete and continuous MDPs, and how they are used in different scenarios. Additionally, we will explore the concept of optimal decision-making in MDPs and how it can be applied in real-world systems.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of MDPs and their role in decision making in large-scale systems. They will also gain practical knowledge on how to apply MDPs in their own decision-making processes. So let's dive into the world of MDPs and discover how they can help us make better decisions in complex systems.




### Subsection: 2.1 Finite-Horizon Problems: Backwards Induction

In the previous chapter, we introduced the concept of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and their importance in decision making in large-scale systems. In this section, we will focus on a specific type of MDP known as finite-horizon problems and discuss the concept of backwards induction, a method used to solve these problems.

#### Finite-Horizon Problems

A finite-horizon problem is a type of MDP where the decision maker has a finite number of decision points or time steps to make a decision. This is in contrast to infinite-horizon problems, where the decision maker has an infinite number of decision points. Finite-horizon problems are commonly used in real-world scenarios, such as resource allocation, scheduling, and inventory management.

#### Backwards Induction

Backwards induction is a method used to solve finite-horizon problems. It involves working backwards from the final time step to the initial time step, making decisions at each time step based on the optimal decisions made at later time steps. This method is particularly useful for problems with a large state space, as it allows the decision maker to break down the problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems.

To illustrate the concept of backwards induction, let's consider a simple example. Suppose we have a company that produces a single product. The company has a finite number of production facilities, each with a different production capacity. The decision maker must decide which facilities to use in each time period, taking into account the current inventory levels and demand for the product.

Using backwards induction, the decision maker would start at the final time step and make the optimal decision based on the current inventory levels and demand. They would then work backwards to the previous time step, taking into account the decisions made at the later time step. This process continues until the initial time step is reached, and the optimal decision is made at each time step.

#### Advantages and Limitations of Backwards Induction

One of the main advantages of backwards induction is its ability to handle large state spaces. By breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems, the decision maker can more easily manage the complexity of the problem. Additionally, backwards induction allows for the consideration of future decisions, which can lead to more optimal solutions.

However, backwards induction also has its limitations. It assumes that the decision maker has perfect information about the future, which may not always be the case in real-world scenarios. Additionally, the optimal decisions made at later time steps may not always be achievable at earlier time steps, leading to suboptimal solutions.

#### Conclusion

In this section, we have discussed the concept of finite-horizon problems and the method of backwards induction. Backwards induction is a powerful tool for solving complex decision-making problems, particularly those with a large state space. However, it is important to consider its limitations and potential drawbacks when applying it to real-world scenarios. In the next section, we will explore the concept of infinite-horizon problems and the methods used to solve them.





### Subsection: 2.2 Discounted-Cost Problems: Cost-to-Go Function, Bellman's Equation

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of finite-horizon problems and the method of backwards induction. In this section, we will focus on a specific type of finite-horizon problem known as discounted-cost problems.

#### Discounted-Cost Problems

A discounted-cost problem is a type of finite-horizon problem where the decision maker must make decisions over a finite number of time steps, taking into account the cost of each decision. In these problems, the cost of each decision is discounted over time, meaning that the cost of a decision made in the future is worth less than the cost of a decision made in the present. This is often the case in real-world scenarios, where the decision maker must balance the cost of a decision against the potential benefits.

#### Cost-to-Go Function

The cost-to-go function is a key concept in discounted-cost problems. It represents the minimum cost that can be achieved from a given state, taking into account the cost of each decision and the discount factor. The cost-to-go function is defined as:

$$
V(x_t) = \min_{a_t} \left\{ F(x_t,a_t) + \beta V(T(x_t,a_t)) \right\}
$$

where $V(x_t)$ is the cost-to-go function, $F(x_t,a_t)$ is the cost of taking action $a_t$ in state $x_t$, and $\beta$ is the discount factor.

#### Bellman's Equation

Bellman's equation is a recursive equation that can be used to solve discounted-cost problems. It is based on the principle of optimality, which states that an optimal policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision are, the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal policy with regard to the state resulting from the first decision. Bellman's equation is defined as:

$$
V(x_t) = \min_{a_t} \left\{ F(x_t,a_t) + \beta V(T(x_t,a_t)) \right\}
$$

where $V(x_t)$ is the cost-to-go function, $F(x_t,a_t)$ is the cost of taking action $a_t$ in state $x_t$, and $\beta$ is the discount factor.

Bellman's equation can be used to solve discounted-cost problems by working backwards from the final time step, making decisions at each time step based on the optimal decisions made at later time steps. This method is particularly useful for problems with a large state space, as it allows the decision maker to break down the problem into smaller, more manageable subproblems.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of infinite-horizon problems and the method of value iteration, another method used to solve these problems.





### Subsection: 2.3a Existence and Uniqueness of Bellman's Equation Solution

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of discounted-cost problems and the cost-to-go function. We also introduced Bellman's equation, a recursive equation that can be used to solve these problems. In this section, we will delve deeper into the existence and uniqueness of the solution to Bellman's equation.

#### Existence of Bellman's Equation Solution

The existence of a solution to Bellman's equation is guaranteed by the principle of optimality. This principle states that an optimal policy has the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision are, the remaining decisions must constitute an optimal policy with regard to the state resulting from the first decision. This means that the cost-to-go function $V(x_t)$ can be calculated recursively from the initial state, and the optimal policy can be determined.

#### Uniqueness of Bellman's Equation Solution

The uniqueness of the solution to Bellman's equation is a bit more complex. It is not always guaranteed, and depends on the specific problem at hand. In general, the solution to Bellman's equation is unique if the cost function $F(x_t,a_t)$ is continuous and the discount factor $\beta$ is strictly less than 1. This ensures that the cost-to-go function $V(x_t)$ is a well-defined function, and the optimal policy is unique.

However, if the cost function is discontinuous or the discount factor is equal to 1, the solution to Bellman's equation may not be unique. In these cases, the optimal policy may depend on the specific initial state and decision.

#### Sylvester Equation and Uniqueness of Bellman's Equation Solution

The Sylvester equation plays a crucial role in the existence and uniqueness of the solution to Bellman's equation. The Sylvester equation is a linear system of equations that arises in the study of Markov decision processes. It is used to calculate the transition probabilities between different states in the Markov chain.

The uniqueness of the solution to Bellman's equation is closely related to the existence of a solution to the Sylvester equation. In particular, the Sylvester equation has a unique solution if and only if the matrices $A$ and $-B$ do not share any eigenvalues. This condition ensures that the cost-to-go function $V(x_t)$ is a well-defined function, and the optimal policy is unique.

In conclusion, the existence and uniqueness of the solution to Bellman's equation is a crucial aspect of decision making in large scale systems. It ensures that the optimal policy can be determined, and provides a framework for solving discounted-cost problems. The Sylvester equation plays a key role in this process, and its solution provides a guarantee for the uniqueness of the Bellman's equation solution.
