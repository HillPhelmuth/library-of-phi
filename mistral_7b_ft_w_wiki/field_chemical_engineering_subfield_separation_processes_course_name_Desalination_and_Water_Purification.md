### Section 1.1 Characteristics of Seawater:

Seawater is the most abundant source of water on Earth, covering approximately 71% of the planet's surface. It is a complex mixture of various dissolved substances, including salts, gases, and organic matter. The physical and chemical properties of seawater are influenced by a variety of factors, including temperature, salinity, and pressure.

#### 1.1a Physical Properties of Seawater

The physical properties of seawater are essential for understanding its behavior and interactions with other systems. These properties include density, viscosity, and thermal conductivity.

##### Density

The density of seawater is a crucial parameter that affects its movement and mixing in the ocean. It is defined as the mass per unit volume and is typically measured in kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m^3). The density of seawater is influenced by temperature, salinity, and pressure. As temperature increases, the density of seawater decreases, while an increase in salinity or pressure can increase its density.

The density of seawater can be calculated using the equation of state of seawater, which relates the thermodynamic properties of the ocean, including density, temperature, salinity, and pressure. This equation is based on empirical thermodynamic properties and can be used to compute the density of seawater from other thermodynamic properties.

As temperature increases, the viscosity of seawater decreases, while an increase in salinity can increase its viscosity. This property is crucial for understanding the movement of seawater and its interactions with other systems.

##### Thermal Conductivity

Thermal conductivity is a measure of a fluid's ability to conduct heat. In seawater, thermal conductivity is influenced by temperature, salinity, and pressure. As temperature increases, the thermal conductivity of seawater decreases, while an increase in salinity or pressure can increase its thermal conductivity. This property is essential for understanding the transfer of heat in the ocean and its impact on climate.

### Subsection 1.1b Chemical Properties of Seawater

In addition to its physical properties, seawater also has unique chemical properties that make it a valuable resource for desalination and water purification. These properties include its high salinity and the presence of various dissolved substances.

#### Salinity

Salinity is a measure of the total amount of dissolved salts in seawater. It is typically expressed in parts per thousand (ppt) or grams per kilogram (g/kg). The average salinity of seawater is around 35 ppt, but it can vary depending on factors such as evaporation, precipitation, and freshwater input from rivers.

The high salinity of seawater is a result of the evaporation of seawater, which concentrates the dissolved salts. This process is also influenced by the presence of freshwater input from rivers, which can dilute the salinity of seawater. The salinity of seawater is a crucial parameter for desalination, as it affects the efficiency and cost of the process.

#### Dissolved Substances

Seawater contains a variety of dissolved substances, including salts, gases, and organic matter. These substances are essential for the functioning of marine ecosystems and have various applications in desalination and water purification.

The most abundant dissolved substances in seawater are salts, which make up approximately 35 ppt of its total composition. These salts are primarily sodium chloride (NaCl), magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), and calcium sulfate (CaSO4). These salts are crucial for desalination, as they are the primary target for removal during the process.

Gases, such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and methane, are also present in seawater. These gases play a vital role in the carbon cycle and have various applications in water purification. For example, oxygen is essential for the survival of marine organisms, while carbon dioxide can be used for carbon capture and storage.

Organic matter, such as phytoplankton and other marine organisms, also contribute to the chemical properties of seawater. These organisms play a crucial role in the marine food web and have various applications in water purification, such as in the removal of nutrients and pollutants.

### Subsection 1.1c Applications of Seawater

Seawater, or salt water, is water from a sea or ocean. On average, seawater in the world's oceans has a salinity of about 3.5% (35 g/L, 35 ppt, 600 mM). This means that every kilogram (roughly one liter by volume) of seawater has approximately 35 grams of dissolved salts (predominantly sodium (<chem|Na||+>) and chloride (<chem|Cl||->) ions). The average density at the surface is 1.025 kg/L. Seawater is denser than both fresh water and pure water (density 1.0 kg/L at ) because the dissolved salts increase the mass by a larger proportion than the volume. The freezing point of seawater decreases as salt concentration increases. At typical salinity, it freezes at about -2°C.

Seawater pH is typically limited to a range between 7.5 and 8.4. However, there is no universally accepted reference pH-scale for seawater and the difference between measurements based on different reference scales may be up to 0.14 units.

### Composition

Measurement and definition difficulties arise because natural waters contain a complex mixture of many different elements from different sources (not all from dissolved salts) in different molecular forms. The chemical properties of some of these forms depend on temperature and pressure. Many of these forms are difficult to measure with high accuracy, and in any case complete chemical analysis is not practical when analyzing multiple samples. Different practical definitions of salinity result from different attempts to account for these problems, to different levels of precision, while still remaining reasonably easy to use.

For practical reasons salinity is usually related to the sum of the concentrations of the major ions in seawater. The most important ions are sodium, chloride, magnesium, sulfate, calcium, and potassium. The sum of these ions is usually expressed in parts per thousand (ppt) or in grams per liter (g/L). The most common definition of salinity is the Practical Salinity Scale (PSS), which is based on the sum of the concentrations of these ions. The PSS is defined as the sum of the concentrations of sodium, chloride, magnesium, sulfate, calcium, and potassium, expressed in ppt.

The PSS is a practical scale that is easy to use and is widely accepted in the scientific community. However, it is not without its limitations. For example, it does not account for the effects of temperature and pressure on the chemical properties of the ions in seawater. This can lead to errors in salinity measurements, especially in regions where there are large variations in temperature and pressure.

Another practical scale is the Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) scale, which is based on the total amount of dissolved solids in seawater. The TDS scale is less commonly used than the PSS, but it is still widely accepted in some regions. The TDS scale is defined as the sum of the concentrations of all dissolved solids in seawater, expressed in milligrams per liter (mg/L).

In addition to these practical scales, there are also more precise scales that account for the effects of temperature and pressure on the chemical properties of the ions in seawater. These scales are based on the thermodynamic properties of the ions and are used in research and scientific publications. However, they are not practical for everyday use due to the complexity of their calculations.

In conclusion, the chemical composition of seawater is complex and difficult to measure with high accuracy. Different practical scales have been developed to account for these difficulties, each with its own advantages and limitations. The choice of scale depends on the specific needs and requirements of the user.





### Subsection: 1.1c Biological Aspects of Seawater

Seawater is not just a simple mixture of salts and minerals. It is also home to a diverse and complex ecosystem of microorganisms. These microorganisms play a crucial role in the biogeochemical cycles of the ocean, influencing the distribution of nutrients and the overall health of marine ecosystems.

#### Microbial Components of Seawater

The microbial components of seawater are as diverse as the physical and chemical properties of the ocean. They include bacteria, archaea, protists, and microscopic animals. These microorganisms are found in all depths of the water column, as well as in the sediments, and some are even found within other organisms.

Research conducted in the 1950s and 1990s has shown that the number of microorganisms in a liter of seawater can range from 10,000 to 20,000 species. This diversity is largely due to the use of advanced techniques for detecting and identifying microbes, such as probing small snippets of DNA.

#### Bacteria in Seawater

Bacteria are one of the most abundant microorganisms in seawater. They are found at all depths and in all types of marine environments, from the surface to the deep sea. Some bacteria are free-swimming, while others exist as symbionts within other organisms.

The Census of Marine Life, conducted in the 1990s, revealed a far greater diversity of bacteria in the ocean than previously suspected. This diversity is largely due to the use of advanced techniques for detecting and identifying microbes.

#### Interactions between Microorganisms and Diatoms

Some bacteria interact with diatoms, a type of microscopic algae, and form a critical link in the cycling of silicon in the ocean. This interaction is crucial for the health of marine ecosystems, as diatoms are a primary source of food for many marine organisms.

#### Anaerobic Bacteria in Seawater

Anaerobic bacteria, which do not require oxygen for respiration, are also found in seawater. One such species, "Thiomargarita namibiensis", plays an important part in the breakdown of hydrogen sulfide eruptions from diatomaceous sediments off the Namibian coast. This process is crucial for the cycling of nutrients in the ocean.

In conclusion, the biological aspects of seawater are as complex and diverse as its physical and chemical properties. The study of these aspects is crucial for understanding the health and functioning of marine ecosystems, and for developing sustainable methods for desalination and water purification.




### Subsection: 1.2a Definition of Concentration

In the context of water supply, concentration is a fundamental concept that describes the amount of a substance present in a solution. It is a measure of the relative amounts of two or more substances in a mixture. The concentration of a substance in a solution can be expressed in various ways, including mass concentration, molar concentration, number concentration, and volume concentration.

#### Mass Concentration

Mass concentration, often denoted as $c$ or $m$, is the mass of a solute dissolved in a solvent, divided by the total mass of the solution. It is typically expressed in units of grams per liter (g/L) or kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m^3). The mass concentration of a solute in a solution can be calculated using the formula:

$$
c = \frac{m_{solute}}{m_{solution}}
$$

where $m_{solute}$ is the mass of the solute and $m_{solution}$ is the mass of the solution.

#### Molar Concentration

Molar concentration, often denoted as $m$ or $M$, is the number of moles of a solute dissolved in a solvent, divided by the total volume of the solution. It is typically expressed in units of moles per liter (mol/L). The molar concentration of a solute in a solution can be calculated using the formula:

$$
m = \frac{n_{solute}}{V_{solution}}
$$

where $n_{solute}$ is the number of moles of the solute and $V_{solution}$ is the volume of the solution.

#### Number Concentration

Number concentration, often denoted as $n$ or $N$, is the number of particles of a solute dissolved in a solvent, divided by the total volume of the solution. It is typically expressed in units of particles per liter (particles/L). The number concentration of a solute in a solution can be calculated using the formula:

$$
n = \frac{N_{solute}}{V_{solution}}
$$

where $N_{solute}$ is the number of particles of the solute and $V_{solution}$ is the volume of the solution.

#### Volume Concentration

Volume concentration, often denoted as $v$ or $V$, is the volume of a solute dissolved in a solvent, divided by the total volume of the solution. It is typically expressed in units of volume per volume (v/v). The volume concentration of a solute in a solution can be calculated using the formula:

$$
v = \frac{V_{solute}}{V_{solution}}
$$

where $V_{solute}$ is the volume of the solute and $V_{solution}$ is the volume of the solution.

In the context of water supply, concentration is a critical parameter that determines the quality of water. High concentrations of certain substances, such as salts or pollutants, can make water unsuitable for drinking or irrigation. Therefore, understanding and controlling the concentration of substances in water is a key aspect of water supply and treatment.




### Subsection: 1.2b Definition of Molality

Molality, often denoted as $b$ or $m$, is a measure of the number of moles of solute in a solution corresponding to 1 kg or 1000 g of solvent. This contrasts with the definition of molarity, which is based on a specified volume of solution. 

A commonly used unit for molality in chemistry is mol/kg. A solution of concentration 1 mol/kg is also sometimes denoted as "1 molal". The unit "mol/kg" requires that molar mass be expressed in "kg/mol", instead of the usual "g/mol" or "kg/kmol".

## Definition

The molality ("b"), of a solution is defined as the amount of substance (in moles) of solute, "n"<sub>solute</sub>, divided by the mass (in kg) of the solvent, "m"<sub>solvent</sub>:

$$
b = \frac{n_{solute}}{m_{solvent}}
$$

In the case of solutions with more than one solvent, molality can be defined for the mixed solvent considered as a pure pseudo-solvent. Instead of mole solute per kilogram solvent as in the binary case, units are defined as mole solute per kilogram mixed solvent.

## Origin

The term "molality" is formed in analogy to "molarity" which is the molar concentration of a solution. The earliest known use of the intensive property molality and of its adjectival unit, the now-deprecated "molal", appears to have been published by G. N. Lewis and M. Randall in the 1923 publication of "Thermodynamics and the Free Energies of Chemical Substances." Though the two terms are subject to being confused with one another, the molality and molarity of a dilute aqueous solution are nearly the same, as one kilogram of water (solvent) occupies the volume of 1 liter at room temperature and a small amount of solute has little effect on the volume.

## Unit

The SI unit for molality is moles per kilogram of solvent.

A solution with a molality of 3 mol/kg is often described as "3 molal", "3 m" or "3 "m"". However, following the SI system of units, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the United States authority on measurement, considers the term "molal" and the unit symbol "m" to be obsolete.
