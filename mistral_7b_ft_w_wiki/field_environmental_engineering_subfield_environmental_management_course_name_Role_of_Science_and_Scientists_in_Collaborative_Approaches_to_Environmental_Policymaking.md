## Foreward

Welcome to "Role of Science and Scientists in Collaborative Approaches to Environmental Policymaking: A Comprehensive Guide". This book aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of science and scientists in collaborative approaches to environmental policymaking. As the world faces increasingly complex environmental challenges, it is crucial to have a deep understanding of the role of science and scientists in shaping policies that can effectively address these challenges.

The book is structured around the concept of collaborative environmental governance (CEG), which recognizes the need for collaboration among stakeholders to address environmental issues. However, as with any approach, CEG also has its limitations and challenges. One of the main challenges is the immediate nature of environmental issues, which often require immediate actions. This can be a barrier to collaboration, as it takes time and resources to develop collaborative systems.

Another challenge is the presence of asymmetric power dynamics, which can hinder collaboration among institutions and actors. These power dynamics can be rooted in the existing power structures between different actors, making collaboration unfeasible. Additionally, increased conflict can arise when large state actors are involved, leading to concerns of co-optation or marginalization of smaller actors.

To address these challenges, the book will delve into the role of science and scientists in shaping environmental policies. It will explore the various ways in which science and scientists can contribute to collaborative approaches, from providing evidence-based information to facilitating dialogue and negotiation among stakeholders.

The book will also examine the concept of the science of science policy (SoSP), which seeks to develop theoretical and empirical models of the scientific enterprise. This approach can help policymakers make better decisions by establishing a scientifically rigorous basis for policy development.

As we embark on this journey, it is important to keep in mind that the role of science and scientists in environmental policymaking is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Each environmental issue and context will require a unique approach, and it is our hope that this book will provide readers with the tools and knowledge to navigate these complexities.

Thank you for joining us on this journey, and we hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for students, researchers, and policymakers alike. Let us work together towards a more sustainable and collaborative future for our planet.

## Chapter: Role of Science and Scientists in Collaborative Approaches to Environmental Policymaking: A Comprehensive Guide




### Section: 1.3 Traditional Role of Science in Society:

#### Subsection: 1.3a Historical Perspective

The role of science in society has evolved significantly over time. From the ancient Greeks' belief in the four elements to the modern understanding of the atom, science has played a crucial role in shaping our understanding of the world. In this section, we will explore the historical perspective of the traditional role of science in society.

##### Ancient Greece

In ancient Greece, the four elements of earth, air, fire, and water were believed to be the building blocks of all matter. This belief was heavily influenced by the philosophies of Thales, Anaximenes, and Heraclitus. Thales believed that all matter was composed of water, while Anaximenes believed that it was composed of air. Heraclitus, on the other hand, believed that all matter was composed of fire.

##### Middle Ages

During the Middle Ages, the role of science in society was heavily influenced by religion. The Church played a dominant role in shaping scientific thought, and many scientific advancements were made in the service of religion. For example, the development of the astrolabe, a device used to measure the position of the stars and planets, was heavily influenced by the Church's interest in astronomy.

##### Renaissance

The Renaissance marked a significant shift in the role of science in society. With the rise of humanism and the rediscovery of ancient Greek and Roman texts, there was a renewed interest in the natural world. This led to the development of new scientific theories and the rejection of medieval beliefs. The Renaissance also saw the rise of the scientific method, which emphasized the use of empirical evidence and experimentation to understand the natural world.

##### Modern Times

In modern times, science has become an integral part of society, with advancements in technology and medicine revolutionizing our lives. The traditional role of science in society has expanded beyond just understanding the natural world. It now plays a crucial role in policymaking, with scientists often serving as advisors to governments and policymakers.

In the next section, we will explore the role of science in policymaking and how it has evolved over time.





### Section: 1.3 Traditional Role of Science in Society:

#### Subsection: 1.3b Science and Public Policy

The traditional role of science in society has been to provide evidence-based knowledge and solutions to societal problems. This role has been particularly evident in the realm of public policy, where science has been used to inform and guide decision-making processes.

##### The Science of Science Policy

The science of science policy (SoSP) is an emerging interdisciplinary research area that seeks to develop theoretical and empirical models of the scientific enterprise. This scientific basis can be used to help government, and society in general, make better R&D management decisions by establishing a scientifically rigorous, quantitative basis from which policy makers and researchers may assess the impacts of the nation's scientific and engineering enterprise, improve their understanding of its dynamics, and assess the likely outcomes. Examples of research in the science of science policy include models to understand the production of science, qualitative, quantitative and computational methods to estimate the impact of science, and processes for choosing from alternative science portfolios.

##### Federal SoSP Effort

The federal government of the United States has long been a supporter of SoSP. In 2006, in response to Office of Science and Technology Policy Director John H. Marburger's challenge for a new "science of science policy," the National Science and Technology Council's Subcommittee on Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE) established an Interagency Task Group on Science of Science Policy (ITG) to serve as part of the internal deliberative process of the Subcommittee. In 2008, the SoSP ITG developed and published The Science of Science Policy: A Federal Research Roadmap, which outlined the Federal efforts necessary for the long-term development of a science of science policy, and presented this Roadmap to the SoSP Community. The ITG's subsequent work has been guided by the questions outlined in the Roadmap and the action steps developed at the workshop. Furthermore, since 2007, the National Science Foundation, in support of academic research to advance the field, has awarded grants from the Science of Science and Innovation Policy (SciSIP) program. The SciSIP research supports and complements the Federal efforts in SoSP.

##### The Role of Science in Public Policy

The traditional role of science in public policy has been to provide evidence-based knowledge and solutions to societal problems. This role has been particularly evident in the realm of environmental policymaking, where science has been used to inform and guide decision-making processes. For example, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been instrumental in providing scientific evidence and solutions to the global climate change problem. The IPCC's reports, which are based on thousands of scientific studies, have been used by policymakers to inform their decisions on climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.

In conclusion, the traditional role of science in society, particularly in public policy, has been to provide evidence-based knowledge and solutions to societal problems. The emerging field of SoSP seeks to further enhance this role by developing theoretical and empirical models of the scientific enterprise, which can be used to inform and guide decision-making processes.

### Introduction

Environmental policy-making is a complex and multifaceted process that involves a wide range of stakeholders, including scientists, policymakers, industry representatives, and the general public. The role of science in this process is crucial, as it provides the foundation for understanding the environmental issues at hand and developing effective solutions. In this chapter, we will explore the role of science in environmental policy-making, including its importance, challenges, and potential solutions.

Science plays a critical role in environmental policy-making by providing evidence-based information and insights into the environmental issues at hand. This information is essential for policymakers to make informed decisions and develop effective policies. However, the role of science in environmental policy-making is not without its challenges. One of the main challenges is the uncertainty and complexity of environmental issues, which can make it difficult for scientists to provide definitive answers. Additionally, there may be conflicting information or opinions among scientists, making it challenging for policymakers to determine the best course of action.

To address these challenges, collaborative approaches to environmental policymaking have emerged. These approaches involve scientists, policymakers, and other stakeholders working together to develop and implement policies. By incorporating diverse perspectives and expertise, collaborative approaches can lead to more comprehensive and effective policies. However, these approaches also come with their own set of challenges, such as balancing competing interests and ensuring transparency and accountability.

In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the role of science in environmental policy-making, exploring its importance, challenges, and potential solutions. We will also examine the role of scientists in this process and how they can effectively communicate their findings and recommendations to policymakers and the public. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of the role of science in environmental policy-making and the importance of collaborative approaches in addressing environmental issues.




### Subsection: 2.1a Stakeholder Engagement

Stakeholder engagement is a crucial aspect of environmental policy-making, as it allows for the inclusion of diverse perspectives and interests in the decision-making process. It involves actively involving individuals or groups who may be affected by the decisions made or have the potential to influence their implementation. This can include government agencies, industry representatives, environmental organizations, and the general public.

The benefits of stakeholder engagement are numerous. It allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the issue at hand, as different perspectives and interests are considered. This can lead to more effective and sustainable solutions that address the needs and concerns of all stakeholders. Additionally, stakeholder engagement can help to build trust and support for the policy, as stakeholders feel that their voices have been heard and considered in the decision-making process.

Stakeholder engagement is particularly important in the context of environmental policy-making, as it allows for the consideration of potential impacts on the environment and society. This is especially important in the face of complex and uncertain environmental issues, where there may be conflicting interests and opinions. By involving stakeholders in the decision-making process, a more balanced and informed approach can be taken, leading to more effective and sustainable policies.

One example of stakeholder engagement in environmental policy-making is the concept of materiality in accounting. Materiality refers to the importance of an issue or concern to stakeholders, and it is a key factor in determining which issues should be included in non-financial statements. Stakeholder engagement is crucial in this process, as it allows for a better understanding of what issues are material to different stakeholders and how they should be addressed in the policy.

Another example is the use of stakeholder engagement in corporate social responsibility (CSR) and achieving the triple bottom line. Companies engage their stakeholders in dialogue to find out what social and environmental issues matter most to them and involve stakeholders in the decision-making process. This allows for a more comprehensive and sustainable approach to addressing environmental issues, as it takes into account the perspectives and concerns of all stakeholders.

In conclusion, stakeholder engagement is a crucial aspect of environmental policy-making. It allows for a more comprehensive and sustainable approach to addressing environmental issues, as it takes into account the perspectives and concerns of all stakeholders. By actively involving stakeholders in the decision-making process, more effective and sustainable solutions can be developed, leading to a better future for all.





### Subsection: 2.1b Consensus Building

Consensus building is a collaborative process that involves the active participation of all stakeholders in reaching a mutually agreeable decision. It is a crucial aspect of environmental policy-making, as it allows for the consideration of diverse perspectives and interests, leading to more effective and sustainable solutions.

The process of consensus building typically involves several stages, including information gathering, discussion, negotiation, and decision-making. It is a dynamic and iterative process, with stakeholders continuously engaging in dialogue and revising their positions based on new information and feedback.

One of the key benefits of consensus building is that it allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the issue at hand. By actively involving all stakeholders, different perspectives and interests are considered, leading to a more holistic understanding of the problem. This can result in more effective and sustainable solutions that address the needs and concerns of all stakeholders.

Consensus building also helps to build trust and support for the policy, as stakeholders feel that their voices have been heard and considered in the decision-making process. This can be particularly important in the context of environmental policy-making, where there may be conflicting interests and opinions. By involving stakeholders in the decision-making process, a more balanced and informed approach can be taken, leading to more effective and sustainable policies.

One example of consensus building in environmental policy-making is the use of the Raft algorithm. Raft is a consensus algorithm used in distributed systems, where multiple servers need to agree on a single decision. It implements consensus by a leader approach, where one server is elected as the leader and is responsible for managing log replication on the other servers. This approach allows for efficient and reliable decision-making, as the leader is responsible for ensuring that all servers reach a consensus on the decision.

In the context of environmental policy-making, the Raft algorithm can be used to facilitate consensus building among stakeholders. By electing a leader who is responsible for managing the decision-making process, all stakeholders can actively participate in the discussion and negotiation, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the issue and a mutually agreeable decision.

In conclusion, consensus building is a crucial aspect of environmental policy-making, as it allows for the consideration of diverse perspectives and interests, leading to more effective and sustainable solutions. By actively involving all stakeholders in the decision-making process, a more holistic understanding of the issue can be achieved, resulting in more effective and sustainable policies. The Raft algorithm provides a useful framework for implementing consensus building in environmental policy-making.





### Subsection: 2.1c Conflict Resolution

Conflict resolution is a crucial aspect of collaborative processes in environmental policy-making. It is a process that involves identifying and addressing disagreements and differences of opinion among stakeholders. The goal of conflict resolution is not to find a single "correct" solution, but rather to reach a mutually agreeable decision that addresses the needs and concerns of all stakeholders.

One approach to conflict resolution is the use of the Rete algorithm. The Rete algorithm is a rule-based production system that is used in artificial intelligence and expert systems. It is particularly useful in situations where there are multiple conflicting rules or goals, as it allows for the efficient and systematic evaluation of these rules.

The Rete algorithm operates in a cycle, where it first matches the current facts in working memory against the rules in the system. This is followed by a conflict resolution phase, where the algorithm determines an order in which the activated production instances may be fired. This is done based on various criteria, such as rule priority, rule order, the time at which facts were asserted to working memory, and the complexity of the production.

Once the conflict set is determined, the algorithm fires the first production instance, executing a list of actions associated with the production. This process continues until all production instances have been fired. Each production instance is only fired once during a single match-resolve-act cycle, a characteristic known as "refraction". However, the sequence of production instance firings may be interrupted at any stage by performing changes to the working memory.

The Rete algorithm is not specifically defined as part of the algorithm, but it is used alongside it. Some specialized production systems do not perform conflict resolution, but the Rete algorithm is a powerful tool for addressing conflicts in collaborative processes for environmental policy-making.

In conclusion, conflict resolution is a crucial aspect of collaborative processes in environmental policy-making. The Rete algorithm, with its efficient and systematic approach to conflict resolution, is a valuable tool for addressing conflicts in these processes. By actively involving all stakeholders and using approaches such as the Rete algorithm, effective and sustainable solutions can be reached in environmental policy-making.





### Subsection: 2.2a Public Participation in Science

Public participation in science is a crucial aspect of environmental policy-making. It involves the active involvement of the public in decision-making processes, particularly in areas where scientific knowledge is uncertain or controversial. This approach is based on the principle that decisions that affect the public should be made with the input of the public.

#### The Importance of Public Participation in Science

Public participation in science is important for several reasons. First, it helps to ensure that decisions are made in a way that aligns with public values and attitudes about acceptable risk. This is particularly important in areas of emerging science, where there may be a lack of consensus among scientists about the potential risks and benefits of new technologies.

Second, public participation can help to build trust in the scientific community. As noted in the related context, abuses of scientific research participants, such as the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, have eroded trust in scientists among vulnerable populations. By involving the public in decision-making processes, scientists can demonstrate their commitment to ethical practices and transparency.

Third, public participation can help to broaden the scope of technological risks considered in decision-making processes. As seen in the example of the 1975 Asilomar conference on recombinant DNA, past efforts to come to scientific consensus on controversial issues have excluded the public, and as a result, narrowed the scope of technological risks considered. By involving the public, a more comprehensive understanding of the potential risks and benefits of new technologies can be achieved.

#### Challenges and Solutions

Despite its importance, public participation in science is not without its challenges. One of the main challenges is the lack of infrastructure and investment needed to facilitate effective participatory decision-making. To address this, a five-part approach has been suggested:

1. Public engagement: This involves raising awareness about scientific issues and engaging the public in discussions about them.
2. Public deliberation: This involves facilitating discussions among the public to understand their values, concerns, and preferences.
3. Public decision-making: This involves involving the public in decision-making processes, either directly or through representatives.
4. Public accountability: This involves ensuring that decisions are made transparently and that there is accountability for their implementation.
5. Public learning: This involves learning from past decisions and continuously improving decision-making processes.

By implementing these steps, the scientific community can effectively involve the public in decision-making processes and build trust and understanding between scientists and the public.

#### Participation in Heritage

Communities can also be involved in local, regional, and national cultural heritage. This can be particularly important in the context of environmental policy-making, as it can help to ensure that decisions respect and preserve cultural values and traditions. For example, indigenous communities may have a deep connection to their land and a unique understanding of its ecology. By involving these communities in decision-making processes, their knowledge and values can be incorporated into environmental policies, leading to more sustainable and culturally sensitive solutions.




### Subsection: 2.2b Citizen Science Initiatives

Citizen science initiatives are a form of public participation in science that involves the public in the collection and analysis of scientific data. These initiatives are often driven by the recognition that there is a wealth of knowledge and experience among the general public that can be harnessed to address environmental and other scientific issues.

#### The Role of Citizen Science in Environmental Policy-Making

Citizen science initiatives can play a crucial role in environmental policy-making. They can provide a direct and immediate way for the public to contribute to scientific research, and can help to build public understanding and support for scientific findings and policies.

For example, the OPAL biodiversity survey, launched by the Open University in 2010, asked the public to investigate their hedges and look for invertebrates and other signs of wildlife. The survey aimed to raise awareness and learn more about life in hedges across the country. Similarly, the OPAL climate survey, launched by the Met Office in 2011, asked people to look for contrails in the sky, estimate their thermal comfort, and measure wind using bubbles. The results of these surveys have helped scientists learn more about the ways we affect our climate, and how we may adapt to it.

Citizen science initiatives can also help to build trust in the scientific community. By involving the public in the collection and analysis of data, these initiatives can demonstrate the importance of scientific research and the need for accurate and unbiased data.

### Subsection: 3.3a Principles of Ecosystem Based Management

Ecosystem-based management (EBM) is a holistic approach to environmental management that considers the interactions between species, ecosystem components, and humans. It is often perceived as a complex process due to the large and diverse areas it is applied to, as well as the uncertainty and difficulty in predicting outcomes. However, in light of significant ecosystem degradation, there is a growing need for a holistic approach that combines environmental knowledge and coordination with governing agencies to initiate, sustain, and enforce habitat and species protection, and include public education and involvement.

#### 3.3a.1 Goals and Objectives

Defining clear and concise goals for ecosystem-based management is one of the most important steps in effective implementation. These goals must move beyond science-based or science-defined objectives to include social, cultural, economic, and environmental importance. It is also crucial to involve the community and stakeholders throughout the entire process. As discussed by Slocombe (1998a), goals should be broadly applicable, measurable and readily observable, and ideally be collectively supported in order to be achievable.

As discussed by Slocombe (1998a), goals should be broadly applicable, measurable and readily observable, and ideally be collectively supported in order to be achievable. The idea is to provide direction for both thinking and action and should try to minimize managing ecosystems in a static state. Goals should also be flexible enough to incorporate a measure of uncertainty and be able to evolve as conditions and knowledge change. This may involve focusing on specific threatening processes or pressures, such as climate change, pollution, or overfishing, and developing strategies to mitigate or adapt to these threats.

#### 3.3a.2 Implementation of Ecosystem Based Management

The implementation of ecosystem-based management involves a collaborative approach, where stakeholders from various sectors, including government agencies, scientists, and local communities, work together to develop and implement management strategies. This approach allows for the incorporation of new information and adaptations to changing conditions, making it well-suited for addressing the complex and dynamic nature of ecosystems.

In addition to clear goals and objectives, effective implementation of ecosystem-based management also requires effective communication and coordination among stakeholders. This can be achieved through regular meetings, workshops, and other forms of communication to ensure that all stakeholders are aware of the goals and objectives and are working towards a common vision.

#### 3.3a.3 Challenges and Future Directions

Despite its potential benefits, the implementation of ecosystem-based management faces several challenges. These include the complexity of ecosystems, uncertainty and difficulty in predicting outcomes, and the need for significant resources and coordination among stakeholders. However, with the growing recognition of the importance of ecosystem health and the increasing availability of scientific knowledge and technology, there is a growing interest in and potential for the successful implementation of ecosystem-based management.

In the future, it is likely that ecosystem-based management will become increasingly used as a form of environmental management. As our understanding of ecosystems and their interactions with humans continues to grow, so too will our ability to effectively manage them. By incorporating principles of ecosystem-based management, we can work towards a more holistic and sustainable approach to environmental management.





### Subsection: 3.3b Ecosystem Services

Ecosystem services are the benefits that humans receive from ecosystems. These services are essential for human well-being and are often taken for granted. However, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, a comprehensive study by over 1000 of the world's leading biological scientists, has highlighted the significant and escalating impact of human activity on the biodiversity of the world's ecosystems. This has reduced both the resilience and biocapacity of natural systems, which are crucial for providing ecosystem services.

#### 3.3b.1 Categories of Ecosystem Services

The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment identified four major categories of ecosystem services: provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services. Provisioning services refer to the tangible, material products of ecosystem processes, such as water, food, fuel, and medicinal plants. These services are often the focus of traditional resource management approaches.

Regulating services, on the other hand, are the processes by which ecosystems maintain the conditions necessary for life on Earth. These include the maintenance of hydrological cycles, cleaning air and water, the maintenance of oxygen in the atmosphere, and crop pollination. These services are often overlooked but are crucial for human health and well-being.

Cultural services are non-material benefits that humans receive from ecosystems, such as recreation, inspiration, and opportunities for research. These services are often difficult to quantify but are essential for human quality of life.

Finally, supporting services, also known as ecosystem services, are the foundation upon which all other ecosystem services depend. These include nutrient cycling, soil formation, and pest regulation. Without these services, the other three categories would not be possible.

#### 3.3b.2 Measuring Ecosystem Services

Measuring ecosystem services is a complex task due to their interconnectedness and the difficulty in assigning a monetary value to many of them. However, it is crucial for understanding the impact of human activity on ecosystems and for developing effective management strategies.

The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment developed a set of indicators to measure the state of ecosystem services. These indicators are used to monitor changes in ecosystem services over time and to assess the effectiveness of management strategies.

#### 3.3b.3 Ecosystem Services and Ecosystem-Based Management

Ecosystem-based management (EBM) recognizes the importance of ecosystem services and aims to balance the needs of humans with the needs of the ecosystem. This approach involves a holistic understanding of ecosystems and the services they provide, as well as the interactions between humans and ecosystems.

EBM also recognizes the need for adaptive management, which involves learning from experience and adjusting management strategies in response to changes in ecosystem services. This is crucial in the face of increasing environmental uncertainty and change.

In conclusion, understanding and managing ecosystem services is crucial for human well-being and the sustainability of our planet. Ecosystem-based management provides a framework for balancing human needs with the needs of the ecosystem, and adaptive management allows us to respond to changes in ecosystem services. By working together, scientists and policymakers can develop effective strategies for managing ecosystem services and ensuring a sustainable future for all.





### Subsection: 3.3c Case Studies in Ecosystem Based Management

Ecosystem-based management (EBM) is a holistic approach that combines environmental knowledge and coordination with governing agencies to initiate, sustain, and enforce habitat and species protection, and include public education and involvement. It is a complex process that is often perceived as difficult to implement due to the large, diverse areas involved and the uncertainty and predictions involved. However, in light of significant ecosystem degradation, there is a need for a holistic approach that includes social, cultural, economic, and environmental importance.

#### 3.3c.1 Goals and Objectives of Ecosystem-based Management

Defining clear and concise goals for ecosystem-based management is one of the most important steps in effective implementation. These goals must move beyond science-based or science-defined objectives to include social, cultural, economic, and environmental importance. It is also crucial to involve the community and stakeholders throughout the entire process. As discussed by Slocombe (1998a), goals should be broadly applicable, measurable and readily observable, and ideally be collectively supported in order to be achievable.

As discussed by Slocombe (1998a), goals should be broadly applicable, measurable and readily observable, and ideally be collectively supported in order to be achievable. The idea is to provide direction for both thinking and action and should try to minimize managing ecosystems in a static state. Goals should also be flexible enough to incorporate a measure of uncertainty and be able to evolve as conditions and knowledge change. This may involve focusing on specific threatening processes or impacts, such as climate change, pollution, or overfishing, and setting goals to mitigate or reverse these impacts.

#### 3.3c.2 Case Studies of Ecosystem-based Management

There are several case studies that demonstrate the successful implementation of ecosystem-based management. One such example is the Chesapeake Bay Program, which has been implementing EBM since the 1980s. The program involves multiple states, federal agencies, and local communities working together to restore the Chesapeake Bay's ecosystem. The program has set clear goals and objectives, involving the community and stakeholders, and has been able to adapt to changing conditions and knowledge.

Another example is the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park in Australia. The park has implemented EBM to protect the diverse ecosystem of the reef, which includes coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and mangrove forests. The park has set clear goals and objectives, involving the community and stakeholders, and has been able to adapt to changing conditions and knowledge.

These case studies demonstrate the importance of involving the community and stakeholders, setting clear goals and objectives, and being flexible enough to adapt to changing conditions and knowledge in the successful implementation of ecosystem-based management. They also highlight the role of science and scientists in providing the necessary knowledge and coordination for effective EBM.
