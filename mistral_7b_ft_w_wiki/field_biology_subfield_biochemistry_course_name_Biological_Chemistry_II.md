## Foreward

Welcome to "Biological Chemistry II: A Comprehensive Guide to Biomolecules, Metabolism, and Evolution". This book is designed to be a comprehensive resource for advanced undergraduate students at MIT, providing a deep dive into the fascinating world of biological chemistry.

As we delve into the complexities of biomolecules, metabolism, and evolution, we will explore the fundamental principles that govern life at the molecular level. This book is not just about memorizing facts and figures, but about understanding the underlying mechanisms and processes that drive life.

The book is structured around the concept of pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC), a powerful computational model that allows us to understand the properties of proteins. According to the PseAAC model, the protein P of Eq.1 can be formulated as

$$
P = \sum_{u=1}^{20+\lambda} f_u
$$

where the (20+$\lambda$) components are given by

$$
\dfrac {f_u} {\sum_{i=1}^{20}f_i \, + \, w\sum_{k=1}^{\lambda} \tau_k}, & (1 \le u \le 20)
\\[10pt]
\dfrac {w \tau_{u-20}} {\sum_{i=1}^{20} f_i \, + \, w\sum_{k=1}^{\lambda} \tau_k}, & (20+1 \le u \le 20+\lambda)
$$

where $w$ is a weight factor and $\tau_k$ is the pseudo amino acid composition of the $k$th amino acid. This model allows us to understand the properties of proteins in a quantitative way, providing a powerful tool for exploring the vast world of biomolecules.

Throughout the book, we will explore the implications of this model, and its applications in understanding the properties of proteins. We will also delve into the fascinating world of metabolism, exploring the complex pathways that govern the production and consumption of energy in living organisms.

Finally, we will explore the concept of evolution, and how the principles of biochemistry and metabolism have shaped the course of life on Earth. We will explore the mechanisms of genetic variation and natural selection, and how these processes have led to the diversity of life we see today.

This book is not just a textbook, but a journey into the fascinating world of biological chemistry. I hope you will join me on this journey, and I look forward to exploring the wonders of biomolecules, metabolism, and evolution with you.

### Section: 1.1 Biomolecules:

Biomolecules are the fundamental building blocks of life. They are the molecules that make up all living organisms and are essential for their survival. Biomolecules can be broadly classified into four categories: proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids. Each of these categories plays a crucial role in the functioning of living organisms.

#### 1.1a Structure of Biomolecules

The structure of biomolecules is crucial to their function. The unique structure of each biomolecule allows it to perform specific tasks in the body. For example, proteins, which are large molecules made up of long chains of amino acids, play a crucial role in many biological processes. The specific sequence of amino acids in a protein determines its shape and function.

Carbohydrates, on the other hand, are simple sugars that provide energy to the body. They have a specific structure that allows them to be easily broken down and used as a source of energy. Lipids, which include fats and oils, are also important for energy storage and insulation. They have a unique structure that allows them to be hydrophobic, meaning they do not mix well with water.

Nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA, are responsible for storing and transmitting genetic information. They have a double-stranded structure that allows them to be stable and resistant to damage. The specific sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid determines the genetic information it carries.

The structure of biomolecules is not only determined by their chemical composition, but also by their interactions with other molecules. For example, proteins often interact with other molecules, such as carbohydrates and lipids, to form complex structures and perform specific functions.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of biomolecules in more detail and discuss their functions in the body.





#### 1.1b Function of Biomolecules

Biomolecules are the fundamental building blocks of life. They are the molecules that make up all living organisms and are essential for their survival. Biomolecules can be broadly classified into four categories: proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids. Each of these categories plays a crucial role in the functioning of living organisms.

##### Proteins

Proteins are large molecules made up of long chains of amino acids. They play a crucial role in many biological processes, including enzyme catalysis, structural support, and signaling. The specific sequence of amino acids in a protein determines its shape and function. For example, the protein hemoglobin is responsible for transporting oxygen in the blood, while the protein insulin is responsible for regulating blood sugar levels.

##### Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are simple sugars that provide energy to the body. They have a specific structure that allows them to be easily broken down and used as a source of energy. For example, glucose, a simple sugar, is the primary source of energy for most organisms. Carbohydrates also play a crucial role in structural support, as seen in the cellulose found in plant cell walls.

##### Lipids

Lipids are hydrophobic molecules that include fats and oils. They are essential for energy storage and insulation. Lipids also play a crucial role in cell membranes, providing a protective barrier and regulating the movement of molecules in and out of the cell.

##### Nucleic Acids

Nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA, are responsible for storing and transmitting genetic information. They have a double-stranded structure that allows them to be stable and resistant to damage. The specific sequence of nucleotides in a nucleic acid determines the genetic information it carries. For example, the DNA molecule carries the genetic instructions for building an organism, while RNA is responsible for translating this information into proteins.

The structure of biomolecules is crucial to their function. The unique structure of each biomolecule allows it to perform specific tasks in the body. For example, the double-stranded structure of DNA allows it to store genetic information, while the specific sequence of amino acids in a protein determines its shape and function. Biomolecules also interact with each other to form complex structures and perform specific functions. For example, proteins often interact with other molecules, such as carbohydrates and lipids, to form complex structures and perform specific functions.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of biomolecules in more detail and discuss their functions in the body.





#### 1.1c Classification of Biomolecules

Biomolecules can be classified based on their chemical composition and structure. This classification is crucial as it helps us understand the function and behavior of these molecules in biological systems.

##### Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are a group of organic compounds that include sugars, starches, celluloses, and gums. They are classified based on their structure and the number of monosaccharide units they contain. Monosaccharides, such as glucose, are the building blocks of carbohydrates. Oligosaccharides are carbohydrates made up of 2 to 10 monosaccharide units, while polysaccharides are made up of more than 10 monosaccharide units.

##### Lipids

Lipids are a diverse group of hydrophobic molecules that include fats, oils, waxes, and phospholipids. They are classified based on their structure and the types of atoms they contain. Triglycerides, for example, are a type of lipid that consists of three fatty acid molecules attached to a glycerol backbone.

##### Proteins

Proteins are large molecules made up of long chains of amino acids. They are classified based on their structure and the types of amino acids they contain. For example, globular proteins are spherical in shape and are often involved in enzyme catalysis, while fibrous proteins are long and straight and are often involved in structural support.

##### Nucleic Acids

Nucleic acids are a group of molecules that include DNA and RNA. They are classified based on their structure and the types of nucleotides they contain. Nucleotides, such as adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine, are the building blocks of nucleic acids.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the structure and function of these biomolecules.




#### 1.2a Enzymes in Biochemical Reactions

Enzymes are essential catalysts in biochemical reactions. They are biological molecules that increase the rate of chemical reactions by lowering the amount of activation energy required for the reaction to occur. Enzymes are highly specific, often catalyzing only one type of reaction or working with one type of molecule. This specificity is due to the unique three-dimensional structure of enzymes, which is determined by their amino acid sequence.

Enzymes can be classified based on the type of reaction they catalyze. For example, hydrolases catalyze the hydrolysis of bonds, oxidoreductases catalyze oxidation-reduction reactions, and transferases transfer functional groups from one molecule to another.

Enzymes also play a crucial role in metabolism, the set of biochemical reactions that occur within the cells of living organisms. Metabolism involves the breakdown and synthesis of biomolecules, and enzymes are responsible for catalyzing these reactions.

The study of enzymes and their reactions is known as enzymology. Enzymologists use various techniques to study enzymes, including spectroscopy, chromatography, and crystallography. These techniques allow them to determine the structure, function, and kinetics of enzymes.

Enzymes are also used in industrial processes, such as in the production of biofuels and pharmaceuticals. The use of enzymes in these processes offers several advantages, including higher yields, lower costs, and reduced environmental impact.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the structure and function of enzymes, and explore how they catalyze biochemical reactions.

#### 1.2b Coenzymes and Cofactors

Coenzymes and cofactors are essential components of enzyme systems. They are non-protein molecules that bind to enzymes to facilitate their catalytic activity. Coenzymes and cofactors can be organic or inorganic molecules, and they can be either tightly or loosely bound to the enzyme.

Coenzymes are organic molecules that are required for the catalytic activity of enzymes. They are often derived from vitamins and are essential for the proper functioning of the enzyme. Coenzymes can be classified into two types: prosthetic groups and cosubstrates.

Prosthetic groups are coenzymes that are tightly bound to the enzyme. They are often part of the enzyme's active site and are required for the enzyme's catalytic activity. For example, the prosthetic group of cytochrome c oxidase is heme, which is essential for the enzyme's role in electron transport.

Cosubstrates, on the other hand, are coenzymes that are loosely bound to the enzyme. They are often involved in the transfer of functional groups or electrons during the reaction. For example, NAD+ and NADP+ are cosubstrates that are involved in oxidation-reduction reactions.

Cofactors are inorganic molecules that are required for the catalytic activity of enzymes. They can be ions, such as metal ions, or small molecules, such as H+ or H2O. Cofactors can be either tightly or loosely bound to the enzyme.

For example, the enzyme carbonic anhydrase requires a zinc ion as a cofactor for its catalytic activity. The zinc ion is tightly bound to the enzyme and is essential for the enzyme's role in carbon dioxide hydration.

The study of coenzymes and cofactors is known as coenzymology. Coenzymologists use various techniques, including spectroscopy, chromatography, and crystallography, to study the structure, function, and kinetics of coenzymes and cofactors.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the role of coenzymes and cofactors in biochemical reactions and explore how they facilitate the catalytic activity of enzymes.

#### 1.2c Regulation of Biochemical Reactions

The regulation of biochemical reactions is a crucial aspect of metabolism. It involves the control of enzyme activity, which can be achieved through various mechanisms. These mechanisms ensure that the rate of a reaction is adjusted to meet the cell's needs, and that excess products are not formed.

One of the primary ways of regulating enzyme activity is through the binding of regulatory molecules. These molecules can be either activators or inhibitors. Activators increase the rate of the reaction by binding to the enzyme and altering its structure, thereby increasing its affinity for the substrate. Inhibitors, on the other hand, decrease the rate of the reaction by binding to the enzyme and preventing it from catalyzing the reaction.

For example, the enzyme phosphofructokinase, which is involved in glycolysis, is activated by ATP and ADP. ATP binding increases the enzyme's affinity for fructose-6-phosphate, thereby increasing the rate of the reaction. Conversely, ADP binding inhibits the enzyme's activity.

Another mechanism of enzyme regulation is through the modification of enzyme activity. This can be achieved through the covalent modification of specific amino acid residues in the enzyme. For example, the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase is inactivated by the covalent addition of a phosphate group to a specific histidine residue. This modification is catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase and is reversed by pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase.

Enzyme activity can also be regulated by allosteric effectors. These are molecules that bind to a site on the enzyme that is not the active site. Allosteric effectors can either increase or decrease the enzyme's affinity for the substrate, thereby regulating the rate of the reaction.

For example, the enzyme phosphofructokinase is inhibited by AMP, an allosteric effector. AMP binding decreases the enzyme's affinity for ATP and ADP, thereby decreasing the rate of the reaction.

The regulation of biochemical reactions is a complex process that involves the coordination of multiple mechanisms. These mechanisms ensure that the rate of a reaction is adjusted to meet the cell's needs, and that excess products are not formed. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for understanding the regulation of metabolism.

#### 1.2d Thermodynamics of Biochemical Reactions

The thermodynamics of biochemical reactions is a critical aspect of understanding metabolism. It involves the study of the energy changes that occur during a reaction, and how these changes are influenced by the environment. 

The energy change of a reaction, denoted as $\Delta G$, is a key parameter in thermodynamics. It is defined as the difference in the Gibbs free energy between the products and the reactants. The Gibbs free energy ($G$) is a thermodynamic potential that measures the maximum reversible work that a system can perform at constant temperature and pressure. 

The Gibbs free energy can be expressed as:

$$
G = H - TS
$$

where $H$ is the enthalpy, $T$ is the absolute temperature, and $S$ is the entropy of the system. The enthalpy is the total energy of the system, including both its internal energy and the energy of its interactions with its surroundings. The entropy is a measure of the disorder or randomness of the system.

In a biochemical reaction, the Gibbs free energy change ($\Delta G$) is often accompanied by a change in the enthalpy ($\Delta H$) and entropy ($\Delta S$). These changes can be calculated from the standard molar enthalpies and entropies of formation of the reactants and products.

For example, the hydrolysis of ATP, a key reaction in metabolism, can be represented as:

$$
\text{ATP} + \text{H}_2\text{O} \rightarrow \text{ADP} + \text{HPO}_4^{2-} + \text{H}^+
$$

The standard molar enthalpy of formation of ATP is -30.5 kJ/mol, while those of ADP, HPO4^2- and H+ are -28.7, -1.4, and 0 kJ/mol, respectively. The standard molar entropy of formation of ATP is 118.8 J/(mol·K), while those of ADP, HPO4^2- and H+ are 130.7, 63.1, and 130.7 J/(mol·K), respectively.

Using these values, we can calculate the standard molar Gibbs free energy of formation of ATP, ADP, HPO4^2-, and H+ as -30.5, -28.7, -1.4, and 0 kJ/mol, respectively. The standard molar Gibbs free energy change of the hydrolysis of ATP is then given by:

$$
\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S
$$

where $\Delta H$ and $\Delta S$ are the standard molar enthalpy and entropy changes of the reaction, respectively.

The thermodynamics of biochemical reactions is a complex field that involves the study of many different types of reactions. However, understanding the basic principles of thermodynamics is crucial for understanding the regulation of metabolism.




#### 1.2b Catalysis in Biochemical Reactions

Catalysis is a fundamental process in biochemical reactions. It involves the acceleration of a chemical reaction by a catalyst, which is a substance that increases the rate of the reaction without being consumed in the process. In biochemical reactions, catalysis is primarily carried out by enzymes, which are biological catalysts.

Enzymes catalyze reactions by lowering the activation energy required for the reaction to occur. This is achieved by creating an enzyme-substrate complex, where the enzyme binds to the substrate, forming a temporary covalent bond. This bond allows the substrate to be positioned in a specific orientation, facilitating the reaction. The enzyme then catalyzes the reaction, breaking the bond and releasing the product.

The catalytic activity of enzymes is influenced by several factors, including temperature, pH, and the presence of inhibitors. Temperature affects the rate of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, with most enzymes having an optimal temperature range. Changes in temperature can denature the enzyme, rendering it ineffective.

pH also plays a crucial role in enzyme catalysis. Enzymes have an optimal pH range within which they function most efficiently. Outside of this range, the enzyme's structure can be altered, affecting its catalytic activity.

Inhibitors can either increase or decrease the rate of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction. Competitive inhibitors bind to the enzyme's active site, preventing the substrate from binding. Non-competitive inhibitors bind to a different site on the enzyme, causing a conformational change that reduces the enzyme's activity.

Enzyme kinetics is the study of how enzymes catalyze reactions. It involves determining the initial rate of the reaction, the Michaelis constant (Km), and the maximum reaction rate (Vmax). The Michaelis constant is a measure of the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate, with a lower Km indicating a higher affinity.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the structure and function of enzymes, and explore how they catalyze biochemical reactions.

#### 1.2c Regulation of Biochemical Reactions

The regulation of biochemical reactions is a complex process that ensures the proper functioning of biological systems. It involves the control of enzyme activity, which is crucial for maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Enzyme activity can be regulated at several levels, including transcription, translation, post-translational modifications, and interactions with other molecules.

Transcriptional regulation is a common mechanism for controlling enzyme activity. This involves the regulation of enzyme gene expression at the transcriptional level. For example, the gene for the enzyme pyruvate kinase is regulated by the transcription factor PPAR-gamma, which binds to the pyruvate kinase gene promoter and either enhances or represses its expression depending on the cellular context[^1^].

Translation is another important level of enzyme regulation. This involves the control of enzyme synthesis at the translational level. For instance, the enzyme glutamine synthetase is regulated by the translation of its mRNA. The binding of the translation repressor protein GCN4 to the glutamine synthetase mRNA inhibits its translation, thereby reducing the amount of glutamine synthetase in the cell[^2^].

Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are chemical modifications that occur after a protein is synthesized. These modifications can alter the structure and function of the protein, including enzymes. For example, the enzyme phosphofructokinase is regulated by phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of phosphofructokinase by the enzyme AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) increases its activity, promoting glycolysis[^3^].

Interactions with other molecules can also regulate enzyme activity. This can involve the formation of complexes with other proteins or the binding of small molecules to the enzyme. For example, the enzyme citrate synthase is regulated by the binding of acetyl-CoA. The binding of acetyl-CoA to citrate synthase inhibits its activity, reducing the production of citrate and promoting the oxidation of acetyl-CoA[^4^].

In conclusion, the regulation of biochemical reactions is a complex process that involves multiple levels of control. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for understanding the functioning of biological systems.

[^2^]: GCN4 and glutamine synthetase mRNA translation.
[^3^]: AMPK and phosphofructokinase phosphorylation.

### Subsection: 1.3a Metabolism in Cellular Functions

Metabolism is a fundamental process in cellular functions. It involves the set of chemical reactions that occur within a cell to maintain life. These reactions are essential for the production of energy, the synthesis of biomolecules, and the elimination of metabolic wastes.

#### 1.3a.1 Energy Production

Energy production is a crucial aspect of metabolism. Cells require energy to carry out various functions, such as cell division, movement, and maintenance of cellular structures. The primary source of energy for most cells is glucose, which is broken down through glycolysis and cellular respiration.

Glycolysis is a series of reactions that break down glucose into pyruvate and lactate. This process produces ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the primary energy currency of the cell. However, glycolysis is anaerobic, meaning it does not require oxygen.

Cellular respiration, on the other hand, is an aerobic process that produces more ATP than glycolysis. It involves the breakdown of pyruvate, produced in glycolysis, to carbon dioxide and water. This process requires oxygen and produces ATP through a series of reactions, including the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation.

#### 1.3a.2 Biomolecule Synthesis

Metabolism also plays a crucial role in the synthesis of biomolecules, such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. These molecules are essential for the structure and function of cells.

Protein synthesis, for instance, involves the assembly of amino acids into long chains, known as polypeptides. This process is carried out by ribosomes, which read the genetic code in messenger RNA (mRNA) and assemble the corresponding amino acid sequence.

Lipid synthesis, on the other hand, involves the assembly of fatty acids and other lipids. These molecules are essential for cell membranes and provide insulation and energy storage.

Nucleic acid synthesis is another important aspect of metabolism. DNA and RNA are synthesized from nucleotides, which are assembled from nitrogenous bases, pentose sugars, and phosphates.

#### 1.3a.3 Waste Elimination

Finally, metabolism is responsible for the elimination of metabolic wastes. These wastes include carbon dioxide, water, and various organic compounds. The elimination of these wastes is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing the accumulation of toxic substances.

In conclusion, metabolism plays a crucial role in cellular functions. It is responsible for energy production, biomolecule synthesis, and waste elimination. Understanding these processes is essential for understanding the fundamental principles of biological chemistry.




### Subsection: 1.3b Signaling in Cellular Functions

Cell signaling is a crucial aspect of cellular functions. It involves the communication between cells and the transmission of signals that regulate various cellular processes, such as growth, differentiation, and response to external stimuli.

#### 1.3b.1 Signal Transduction

Signal transduction is the process by which a cell receives and responds to a signal. This process involves a series of molecular interactions that transmit the signal from the cell surface to the nucleus or other intracellular sites.

The first step in signal transduction is the binding of a ligand to a cell surface receptor. This ligand can be a hormone, a growth factor, or any other molecule that can bind to a specific receptor. The binding of the ligand to the receptor triggers a series of intracellular events, leading to the activation of specific signaling pathways.

One of the key signaling pathways is the MAPK signaling pathway. This pathway is involved in a wide range of cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, and response to stress. The MAPK signaling pathway is activated by the binding of a ligand to a cell surface receptor, leading to the activation of a series of kinases, including MAPK.

#### 1.3b.2 Signal Amplification

Signal amplification is a crucial aspect of cell signaling. It involves the amplification of the initial signal to ensure that it reaches the nucleus or other intracellular sites. This amplification is often achieved through the activation of a series of kinases, which phosphorylate and activate downstream molecules, leading to the amplification of the signal.

One example of signal amplification is the Ras signaling pathway. This pathway is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. The binding of a ligand to a cell surface receptor leads to the activation of Ras, a small GTPase. Ras then activates a series of kinases, leading to the amplification of the signal and the activation of downstream processes.

#### 1.3b.3 Signal Termination

Signal termination is the process by which a cell stops responding to a signal. This process is crucial for maintaining cellular homeostasis and preventing the over-activation of signaling pathways.

Signal termination can occur through several mechanisms, including the dephosphorylation of signaling molecules, the internalization of cell surface receptors, and the degradation of signaling molecules. These mechanisms ensure that the cell responds only to transient changes in the environment and does not over-respond to long-lasting stimuli.

In conclusion, cell signaling is a complex and highly regulated process that plays a crucial role in cellular functions. It involves the transmission of signals from the cell surface to the nucleus or other intracellular sites, the amplification of these signals, and the termination of the response when necessary. Understanding these processes is crucial for understanding the complex network of interactions that govern cellular functions.
