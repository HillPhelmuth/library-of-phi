### Subsection 1.1: Basics of Electron Microprobe Analysis

Electron microprobe analysis (EMPA) is a powerful analytical technique used to determine the chemical composition of a sample. It is based on the principle of energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), which involves the use of a focused beam of electrons to excite the atoms in a sample, causing them to emit characteristic X-rays. These X-rays are then detected and analyzed to identify and quantify the elements present in the sample.

The electron beam used in EMPA is generated by a heated filament, similar to a cathode ray tube. The beam is then focused and directed onto the sample using electromagnetic lenses. The beam is typically rastered across the sample, allowing for the analysis of a larger area.

The interaction of the electron beam with the sample results in the emission of secondary electrons (SE), backscattered electrons (BSE), and characteristic X-rays. The SE and BSE signals are used for imaging, while the X-ray signals are used for elemental analysis.

The X-ray signals are detected by a solid-state detector, which is placed at a 90Â° angle to the electron beam. The detector is sensitive to a wide range of X-ray energies, allowing for the detection of elements with atomic numbers greater than 11.

The X-ray signals are then analyzed using a spectrometer, which separates the X-rays based on their energy. The resulting spectrum is compared to a database of known X-ray energies and intensities to identify the elements present in the sample.

EMPA has a wide range of applications, including materials science, geology, and environmental science. It is particularly useful for the analysis of solid materials, as it allows for the determination of the chemical composition of a sample with high precision and sensitivity.

In the next section, we will discuss the different types of electron microprobes and their applications.

### Subsection 1.1a Introduction to Electron-Specimen Interactions

In electron microprobe analysis (EMPA), the interaction between the electron beam and the sample is crucial for obtaining accurate and reliable results. This interaction can be categorized into two main types: elastic scattering and inelastic scattering.

Elastic scattering, also known as backscattering, occurs when the incident electrons interact with the sample without changing their energy. This type of scattering is responsible for the generation of backscattered electrons (BSE), which can be used for imaging and elemental analysis. The energy of the BSE is typically lower than the energy of the incident electrons, and their intensity is dependent on the atomic number of the sample.

Inelastic scattering, on the other hand, involves the transfer of energy from the incident electrons to the sample. This can result in the excitation of the sample's atoms, leading to the emission of characteristic X-rays. These X-rays can be detected and analyzed to identify and quantify the elements present in the sample.

The interaction between the electron beam and the sample can also result in the generation of secondary electrons (SE). These electrons are emitted from the sample surface and can be used for imaging. The intensity of the SE signal is dependent on the topography of the sample surface, with higher intensities indicating a rougher surface.

The interaction of the electron beam with the sample can be further understood by considering the concept of the electron energy spectrum. This spectrum represents the range of energies that the electrons can have, and it is affected by factors such as the accelerating voltage and the sample's atomic number. The energy spectrum can be manipulated to optimize the interaction between the electron beam and the sample, allowing for more accurate and precise results.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the principles and techniques used in electron microprobe analysis, including the detection and analysis of BSE and SE signals, as well as the use of energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy for elemental analysis.




### Subsection 1.1b Types of Electron-Specimen Interactions

In the previous section, we discussed the two main types of electron-specimen interactions: elastic scattering and inelastic scattering. In this section, we will delve deeper into these interactions and explore the different types of electron-specimen interactions that can occur.

#### Elastic Scattering

Elastic scattering, also known as backscattering, is a type of interaction where the incident electrons interact with the sample without changing their energy. This type of scattering is responsible for the generation of backscattered electrons (BSE), which can be used for imaging and elemental analysis. The energy of the BSE is typically lower than the energy of the incident electrons, and their intensity is dependent on the atomic number of the sample.

There are two main types of elastic scattering: coherent scattering and incoherent scattering. Coherent scattering occurs when the incident electrons interact with the sample in a coordinated manner, resulting in a coherent scattering pattern. This type of scattering is more common at higher electron energies and can provide information about the crystal structure of the sample.

Incoherent scattering, on the other hand, occurs when the incident electrons interact with the sample in a random manner, resulting in an incoherent scattering pattern. This type of scattering is more common at lower electron energies and can provide information about the electronic structure of the sample.

#### Inelastic Scattering

Inelastic scattering involves the transfer of energy from the incident electrons to the sample, resulting in the excitation of the sample's atoms. This can lead to the emission of characteristic X-rays, which can be detected and analyzed to identify and quantify the elements present in the sample.

There are two main types of inelastic scattering: direct inelastic scattering and indirect inelastic scattering. Direct inelastic scattering occurs when the incident electrons transfer energy directly to the sample's atoms, resulting in the emission of X-rays. This type of scattering is more common at higher electron energies and can provide information about the electronic structure of the sample.

Indirect inelastic scattering, on the other hand, occurs when the incident electrons transfer energy to the sample's atoms through the mediation of lattice vibrations (phonons). This type of scattering is more common at lower electron energies and can provide information about the lattice structure of the sample.

#### Other Types of Interactions

In addition to elastic and inelastic scattering, there are other types of electron-specimen interactions that can occur. These include Auger electron emission, secondary electron emission, and cathodoluminescence.

Auger electron emission occurs when an electron is emitted from the sample due to the relaxation of an excited atom. This type of emission can provide information about the electronic structure of the sample.

Secondary electron emission occurs when an electron is emitted from the sample due to the interaction of the incident electrons with the sample's surface. This type of emission can provide information about the topography of the sample surface.

Cathodoluminescence occurs when the incident electrons excite the atoms in the sample, resulting in the emission of light. This type of emission can provide information about the electronic structure and composition of the sample.

In the next section, we will discuss the principles and techniques used in electron microprobe analysis, which involves the detection and analysis of the different types of electron-specimen interactions discussed in this section.





### Subsection 1.1c Effects of Electron-Specimen Interactions

In the previous section, we discussed the different types of electron-specimen interactions that can occur. In this section, we will explore the effects of these interactions on the sample and how they can be used for analysis.

#### Backscattered Electrons

As mentioned earlier, backscattered electrons (BSE) are generated when the incident electrons interact with the sample through elastic scattering. These electrons can be detected and used for imaging and elemental analysis. The intensity of BSE is dependent on the atomic number of the sample, with higher atomic number samples producing stronger BSE signals.

BSE can also provide information about the topography of the sample. The intensity of BSE is affected by the angle of incidence of the incident electrons, with a higher angle resulting in a stronger BSE signal. This can be used to create topographic maps of the sample surface.

#### Characteristic X-Rays

Inelastic scattering can also lead to the emission of characteristic X-rays, which can be detected and analyzed to identify and quantify the elements present in the sample. These X-rays are unique to each element and can be used to create elemental maps of the sample.

The intensity of the characteristic X-rays is dependent on the atomic number of the sample, with higher atomic number samples producing stronger signals. This can be used to determine the relative abundance of different elements in the sample.

#### Secondary Electrons

Secondary electrons (SE) are generated when the incident electrons interact with the sample through inelastic scattering. These electrons can be detected and used for imaging and elemental analysis. The intensity of SE is dependent on the atomic number of the sample, with higher atomic number samples producing stronger SE signals.

SE can also provide information about the topography of the sample. The intensity of SE is affected by the angle of incidence of the incident electrons, with a higher angle resulting in a stronger SE signal. This can be used to create topographic maps of the sample surface.

In conclusion, electron-specimen interactions play a crucial role in electron microprobe analysis. By understanding the different types of interactions and their effects, we can gain valuable information about the sample and use it for analysis. 





### Subsection 1.2a Introduction to Electron Detectors

Electron detectors are essential components in electron microprobe analysis, as they are responsible for detecting and measuring the electrons emitted from the sample. These detectors play a crucial role in providing information about the sample's composition, topography, and other properties.

#### Types of Electron Detectors

There are several types of electron detectors used in electron microprobe analysis, each with its own advantages and limitations. Some of the commonly used types include the scintillating detector, the solid-state detector, and the gas-filled detector.

##### Scintillating Detector

The scintillating detector is one of the most commonly used detectors in electron microprobe analysis. It consists of a scintillating material, such as sodium iodide (NaI), which emits light when exposed to electrons. The light is then detected by a photomultiplier tube, which amplifies the signal and sends it to the analyzer. The scintillating detector is sensitive to a wide range of electron energies and can provide high-resolution images.

##### Solid-State Detector

The solid-state detector is another commonly used detector in electron microprobe analysis. It consists of a solid material, such as silicon or germanium, which is sensitive to electrons. When electrons are incident on the detector, they create electron-hole pairs, which are then collected and amplified by a charge-sensitive preamplifier. The solid-state detector is less sensitive to low-energy electrons compared to the scintillating detector, but it is more sensitive to high-energy electrons.

##### Gas-Filled Detector

The gas-filled detector, also known as the gas-discharge detector, is a relatively new type of detector used in electron microprobe analysis. It consists of a gas-filled chamber, where the electrons are detected by creating ionization and avalanche amplification. The gas-filled detector is highly sensitive to low-energy electrons and can provide high-resolution images.

#### Applications of Electron Detectors

Electron detectors have a wide range of applications in electron microprobe analysis. They are used for imaging, elemental analysis, and topographic mapping. The choice of detector depends on the specific requirements of the analysis, such as the desired resolution, sensitivity, and energy range.

##### Imaging

Electron detectors are used for imaging the sample surface, providing information about the topography and composition of the sample. The scintillating detector is commonly used for imaging due to its high resolution and sensitivity. The solid-state detector is also used for imaging, but it is more suitable for high-energy electrons.

##### Elemental Analysis

Electron detectors are also used for elemental analysis, where the emitted electrons are analyzed to determine the composition of the sample. The scintillating detector is commonly used for this purpose, as it is sensitive to a wide range of electron energies. The solid-state detector is also used for elemental analysis, but it is more suitable for high-energy electrons.

##### Topographic Mapping

Topographic mapping is another important application of electron detectors. By analyzing the topography of the sample surface, information about the sample's surface roughness, height, and other properties can be obtained. The scintillating detector is commonly used for topographic mapping, as it provides high-resolution images.

In conclusion, electron detectors play a crucial role in electron microprobe analysis, providing information about the sample's composition, topography, and other properties. The choice of detector depends on the specific requirements of the analysis, and multiple detectors may be used simultaneously for a more comprehensive analysis.

When electrons are incident on the detector, they create electron-hole pairs, which are then collected and amplified by a charge-sensitive preamplifier. The solid-state detector is less sensitive to low-energy electrons compared to the scintillating detector, but it is more sensitive to high-energy electrons.

#### Gas-Filled Detector

The gas-filled detector, also known as the gas-discharge detector, is a relatively new type of detector used in electron microprobe analysis. It consists of a gas-filled chamber, where the electrons are detected by creating ionization and avalanche amplification. The gas-filled detector is highly sensitive to low-energy electrons and can provide high-resolution images. However, it is less sensitive to high-energy electrons compared to the scintillating and solid-state detectors.

#### Microchannel Plate Detector

The microchannel plate detector is a type of detector that is commonly used in electron microprobe analysis. It consists of a series of microchannels, each with a diameter of a few micrometers, which are filled with a gas. When electrons are incident on the detector, they create ionization in the gas, which is then amplified by the microchannels. The microchannel plate detector is highly sensitive to low-energy electrons and can provide high-resolution images. However, it is less sensitive to high-energy electrons compared to the scintillating and solid-state detectors.

#### Z Stack MCP Detector

The Z stack MCP detector is a type of microchannel plate detector that is specifically designed for electron microprobe analysis. It consists of three microchannel plates, each with a different gas filling, which are stacked on top of each other. This allows for the detection of a wide range of electron energies, from low to high, with high sensitivity and resolution. The Z stack MCP detector is a powerful tool for electron microprobe analysis, providing high-resolution images and accurate composition measurements.





### Subsection 1.2c Applications of Electron Detectors

Electron detectors have a wide range of applications in electron microprobe analysis. They are used to detect and measure the electrons emitted from the sample, providing valuable information about the sample's composition, topography, and other properties.

#### Composition Analysis

One of the primary applications of electron detectors is in composition analysis. By detecting the electrons emitted from the sample, the detector can provide information about the elements present in the sample. This is achieved by measuring the energy of the electrons, which is unique to each element. The results can then be compared to a database of known elemental energies to identify the elements present in the sample.

#### Topography Imaging

Electron detectors are also used in topography imaging. By detecting the secondary electrons emitted from the sample, a topography image can be created. This image provides information about the surface topography of the sample, allowing for the identification of surface features and defects.

#### Chemical Imaging

Chemical imaging is another important application of electron detectors. By detecting the backscattered electrons emitted from the sample, a chemical image can be created. This image provides information about the chemical composition of the sample, allowing for the identification of different chemical phases.

#### Environmental Analysis

Electron detectors are also used in environmental analysis. By detecting the electrons emitted from the sample in a gaseous environment, information about the sample's interaction with the environment can be obtained. This is particularly useful in studying the effects of different gases on the sample's composition and topography.

#### Other Applications

In addition to the above applications, electron detectors are also used in other areas such as failure analysis, material characterization, and quality control. They are essential tools in electron microprobe analysis, providing valuable information about the sample's properties and behavior. 





### Subsection 1.3a Introduction to Scanning Electron Imaging

Scanning electron imaging is a powerful technique used in electron microprobe analysis to obtain high-resolution images of the sample surface. It is a non-destructive method that provides valuable information about the sample's topography, composition, and other properties.

#### Backscattered Electrons (BSE)

Backscattered electrons (BSE) are one of the two types of electrons detected in scanning electron imaging, the other being secondary electrons (SE). BSE are emitted back out from the specimen due to beam-specimen interactions where the electrons undergo elastic and inelastic scattering. They have energies from 50 eV up to the energy of the primary beam by conventional definition.

The detection and imaging of BSE have been achieved using various methods, including scintillating and solid-state materials. These materials have been adapted and used also in Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) in addition to the use of the Gas Discharge Detector (GDD) for BSE detection and imaging.

#### Gas Discharge Detector (GDD)

The GDD is a crucial component in ESEM, particularly in the detection and imaging of BSE. It is a device that generates a gas discharge when exposed to high voltage and high current. The GDD is designed to operate in the gaseous conditions of the ESEM, where it generates additional ionization and avalanche amplification.

The GDD has an inner volume where the secondary electrons dominate with small or negligible BSE contribution, and an outer gaseous volume acted upon mainly by the BSE. This allows for the separation of the corresponding detection volumes, resulting in near-pure BSE images.

#### Adapted Detectors

Despite the advancements in the GDD, devoted BSE detectors in the ESEM have played an important role. These detectors have been adapted to operate in the gaseous conditions of the ESEM, with the BSE having a high energy and being self-propelled to the corresponding detector without significant obstruction by the gas molecules.

In conclusion, scanning electron imaging is a crucial technique in electron microprobe analysis, providing valuable information about the sample's properties. The detection and imaging of BSE have been achieved using various methods, including the GDD and adapted detectors.





### Subsection 1.3b BSE and SE Imaging Techniques

Scanning electron imaging is a powerful tool in electron microprobe analysis, providing high-resolution images of the sample surface. The two types of electrons detected in this technique are backscattered electrons (BSE) and secondary electrons (SE). In this section, we will delve deeper into the imaging techniques used for these two types of electrons.

#### Backscattered Electron Imaging (BSEI)

Backscattered electron imaging (BSEI) is a technique used to obtain high-resolution images of the sample surface. BSEI is particularly useful for imaging the topography of the sample, as well as for identifying the elemental composition of the sample.

The BSEI technique involves the detection of backscattered electrons, which are emitted back out from the specimen due to beam-specimen interactions where the electrons undergo elastic and inelastic scattering. These electrons have energies from 50 eV up to the energy of the primary beam by conventional definition.

The detection and imaging of BSE have been achieved using various methods, including scintillating and solid-state materials. These materials have been adapted and used also in Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) in addition to the use of the Gas Discharge Detector (GDD) for BSE detection and imaging.

#### Secondary Electron Imaging (SEI)

Secondary electron imaging (SEI) is another technique used in scanning electron imaging. SEI is particularly useful for imaging the surface of the sample, as well as for identifying the elemental composition of the sample.

The SEI technique involves the detection of secondary electrons, which are emitted from the sample surface due to the interaction of the primary electron beam with the sample. These electrons provide information about the topography of the sample surface, as well as the elemental composition of the sample.

The detection and imaging of SE have been achieved using various methods, including scintillating and solid-state materials. These materials have been adapted and used also in ESEM in addition to the use of the GDD for SE detection and imaging.

#### Adapted Detectors

Despite the advancements in the GDD, devoted BSE and SE detectors in the ESEM have played an important role. These detectors have been adapted to operate in the gaseous conditions of the ESEM, with the BSE and SE having high energy and being self-propelled to the corresponding detection volumes. This allows for the separation of the corresponding detection volumes, resulting in near-pure BSE and SE images.

The relationship of relative strength of the two signals, SE and BSE, has been worked out by detailed equations of charge distribution in the ESEM. The analysis of plane electrodes is essential in understanding the principles and requirements involved and by no means indicate the best choice of electrode configuration, as discussed in the published theory of the GDD.

#### Applications of BSE and SE Imaging

BSE and SE imaging have a wide range of applications in electron microprobe analysis. They are particularly useful for imaging the topography and elemental composition of the sample surface, as well as for identifying the presence of different phases in the sample.

BSE imaging is particularly useful for imaging the topography of the sample, as well as for identifying the elemental composition of the sample. SE imaging, on the other hand, is particularly useful for imaging the surface of the sample, as well as for identifying the elemental composition of the sample.

The combination of BSE and SE imaging provides a comprehensive view of the sample surface, allowing for a more complete understanding of the sample's properties. This makes BSE and SE imaging an essential tool in electron microprobe analysis.
