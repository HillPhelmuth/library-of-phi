In the United States, the budget for national security is a significant portion of the overall federal budget. It includes funding for the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, and various intelligence agencies. The budget also covers expenses for military operations, research and development, and equipment and technology.

The budget for national security is not a static entity, but rather a dynamic and ever-changing one. It is influenced by a variety of factors, including global events, political ideologies, and economic conditions. For example, the events of 9/11 led to a significant increase in defense and security spending, as the government responded to the threat of terrorism. Similarly, changes in the global political landscape, such as the rise of new powers and the decline of others, can also impact the budget for national security.

### Subsection 1.3: The Process of Creating a Budget

The process of creating a budget for national security is a complex and multi-step one. It involves input from various departments and agencies, as well as careful consideration of economic and political factors. The budget is typically created and approved by the President and Congress, with input from the Department of Defense and other relevant agencies.

The process begins with the President submitting a budget proposal to Congress, which outlines the proposed spending for the upcoming fiscal year. This proposal is then reviewed and revised by Congress, with input from various committees and subcommittees. The final budget is then approved by both the House and Senate and signed into law by the President.

### Subsection 1.4: The Impact of Budgets on National Security

The budget for national security has a significant impact on the country's defense and security capabilities. It determines the level of funding for different branches of the military and intelligence agencies, as well as the allocation of resources among them. Adequate funding is crucial for maintaining the country's defense and security capabilities, as well as for responding to unexpected events and threats.

In the following chapters, we will delve deeper into the specifics of U.S. budgets for national security, examining their history, evolution, and impact in more detail.


## Chapter: U.S. Budgets for National Security: A Comprehensive Analysis




### Subsection 1.1a Definition of Policy

Policy is a crucial aspect of budgets for national security. It is a set of guidelines that govern the decisions and actions of individuals or organizations. In the context of budgets, policy refers to the principles and objectives that guide the allocation of resources and funding.

Policies for budgets can be broadly categorized into two types: financial policies and budget policies. Financial policies deal with the management of financial resources, while budget policies focus on the allocation of resources and funding. Both types of policies are essential for the effective and efficient management of budgets for national security.

Financial policies for budgets include guidelines for managing financial resources, such as setting interest rates, managing debt, and investing in financial instruments. These policies are crucial for ensuring the stability and sustainability of the budget.

Budget policies, on the other hand, deal with the allocation of resources and funding. They are based on the principles of resource allocation and prioritization. These policies are crucial for ensuring that resources are allocated in a way that aligns with the objectives and priorities of the budget.

In the context of national security, budget policies are particularly important. They guide the allocation of resources and funding for defense and security agencies, as well as the overall budget for national security. These policies are influenced by a variety of factors, including global events, political ideologies, and economic conditions.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the role of policies in shaping budgets for national security. We will explore the different types of policies that are used, their impact on the budget, and the factors that influence their creation and implementation.





### Section 1.1 Money is Policy:

In the previous section, we discussed the definition of policy and its role in budgets. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of money as policy and how it shapes budgets for national security.

#### 1.1b Role of Money in Policy Making

Money plays a crucial role in policy making, particularly in the context of budgets for national security. It is the medium through which policies are implemented and enforced. Without adequate funding, even the most well-crafted policies can fail to achieve their intended goals.

One of the key ways in which money influences policy making is through its impact on resource allocation. As mentioned in the previous section, budget policies are based on the principles of resource allocation and prioritization. Money allows policymakers to allocate resources towards specific objectives and priorities. For example, in the context of national security, money can be used to fund defense and security agencies, research and development of new technologies, and training for military personnel.

Moreover, money also plays a role in shaping the overall budget for national security. The amount of money allocated for national security is a reflection of the government's priorities and values. It is a statement of how much the government is willing to invest in protecting its citizens and maintaining its national interests. As such, changes in the budget for national security can indicate shifts in policy priorities.

In addition to resource allocation, money also influences policy making through its impact on decision making. Policymakers must consider the availability of funding when making decisions about policies and programs. This can lead to trade-offs and compromises, as policymakers must balance their policy goals with the limited resources available.

Furthermore, money can also be used as a tool for incentivizing behavior. For example, in the context of national security, the government may offer financial incentives to companies or individuals who contribute to the development of new technologies or services that can enhance national security. This can be seen as a way of using money to shape policy outcomes.

In conclusion, money is a powerful tool in policy making, particularly in the context of budgets for national security. It allows policymakers to allocate resources, shape priorities, and incentivize behavior. Understanding the role of money in policy making is crucial for comprehending the complex dynamics of budgets for national security. 





### Section 1.1c Impact of Budget on Policy

The budget has a significant impact on policy making, particularly in the context of national security. As mentioned in the previous section, the budget is a reflection of the government's priorities and values. It is also a tool for implementing and enforcing policies.

One of the key ways in which the budget impacts policy making is through its influence on resource allocation. The budget determines how much money is available for different policies and programs. This can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of these policies. For example, if the budget for national security is cut, it may not be possible to adequately fund defense and security agencies, research and development, and training for military personnel. This could weaken the country's defense capabilities and compromise national security.

Moreover, the budget also plays a role in shaping the overall budget for national security. Changes in the budget can indicate shifts in policy priorities. For instance, an increase in the budget for national security may suggest that the government is prioritizing defense and security. Conversely, a decrease in the budget may indicate a shift in priorities towards other areas.

In addition to resource allocation, the budget also influences policy making through its impact on decision making. Policymakers must consider the budget when making decisions about policies and programs. This can lead to trade-offs and compromises, as policymakers must balance their policy goals with the limited resources available.

Furthermore, the budget can also be used as a tool for incentivizing behavior. For example, the government may offer incentives to companies or individuals to encourage certain behaviors or actions. These incentives can be funded through the budget, and their availability can influence policy making.

In conclusion, the budget plays a crucial role in policy making, particularly in the context of national security. It influences resource allocation, decision making, and incentivizing behavior, and can indicate shifts in policy priorities. As such, it is an essential tool for policymakers in implementing and enforcing policies.





### Subsection 1.2a Overview of Federal Budget

The federal budget is a comprehensive document that outlines the government's financial plan for a fiscal year. It includes projected revenue, expenditures, and deficits or surpluses. The budget is a critical tool for policymakers as it allows them to allocate resources, prioritize spending, and make decisions about taxation and borrowing.

The federal budget is typically prepared by the Department of the Treasury and presented to Congress by the President. It is then reviewed and amended by Congress before being passed into law. The budget process begins in the fall of the previous year and is typically completed by the end of the following January.

The budget is divided into several sections, including the budget message, budget summary, and detailed budget tables. The budget message provides an overview of the budget and outlines the President's economic and fiscal policies. The budget summary provides a concise overview of the budget, including projected revenue, expenditures, and deficits or surpluses. The detailed budget tables provide a more comprehensive breakdown of the budget, including individual agency budgets and proposed spending for various programs and initiatives.

The federal budget is a dynamic document that is subject to changes throughout the year. As such, it is important for policymakers and the public to understand the budget process and how it can be influenced by various factors.

### Subsection 1.2b Role of Budgets in Policy

Budgets play a crucial role in policy making, particularly in the context of national security. As mentioned in the previous section, the budget is a reflection of the government's priorities and values. It is also a tool for implementing and enforcing policies.

One of the key ways in which the budget impacts policy making is through its influence on resource allocation. The budget determines how much money is available for different policies and programs. This can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of these policies. For example, if the budget for national security is cut, it may not be possible to adequately fund defense and security agencies, research and development, and training for military personnel. This could weaken the country's defense capabilities and compromise national security.

Moreover, the budget also plays a role in shaping the overall budget for national security. Changes in the budget can indicate shifts in policy priorities. For instance, an increase in the budget for national security may suggest that the government is prioritizing defense and security. Conversely, a decrease in the budget may indicate a shift in priorities towards other areas.

In addition to resource allocation, the budget also influences policy making through its impact on decision making. Policymakers must consider the budget when making decisions about policies and programs. This can lead to trade-offs and compromises, as policymakers must balance their policy goals with the limited resources available.

Furthermore, the budget can also be used as a tool for incentivizing behavior. For example, the government may offer incentives to companies or individuals to encourage certain behaviors or actions. These incentives can be funded through the budget, and their availability can influence policy making.

In conclusion, budgets play a crucial role in policy making, particularly in the context of national security. They determine resource allocation, shape policy priorities, and influence decision making. As such, it is important for policymakers and the public to understand the budget process and how it can be used to achieve policy goals.





### Subsection 1.2b Budget Process

The budget process in the United States is a complex and lengthy one, involving multiple stages and actors. It begins with the President's budget request, which is then reviewed and amended by Congress before being passed into law. This process is guided by the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, which requires the President to submit a budget to Congress for each fiscal year.

#### Presidential Budget Request

The President's budget request is a comprehensive proposal of the administration's intended revenue and spending plans for the following fiscal year. It is formulated over a period of months with the assistance of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the largest office within the Executive Office of the President. The budget request includes funding requests for all federal executive departments and independent agencies, and is accompanied by supporting documents and historical budget data.

The budget request is a critical tool for policymakers, as it provides a detailed breakdown of the government's financial plan. It includes projected revenue, expenditures, and deficits or surpluses, as well as policy proposals and initiatives with significant budgetary implications. The budget request is also accompanied by a budget message, which provides an overview of the budget and outlines the President's economic and fiscal policies.

#### Congressional Review and Amendment

Once the President's budget request is submitted, it is reviewed and amended by Congress. This process involves multiple committees and subcommittees, and can be lengthy and contentious. Congress has the power to accept, reject, or modify the President's budget request, and often does so in response to political and policy considerations.

The budget process is guided by the principles of budget reconciliation, which allows for expedited consideration of budget-related legislation. This process is used to address major budgetary issues, such as tax cuts or increases, and can be used to override a Presidential veto.

#### Final Passage and Implementation

After the budget has been reviewed and amended by Congress, it is passed into law. This typically occurs in the fall of the fiscal year, and the budget becomes effective on October 1. The budget is then implemented by the various federal agencies, and is subject to ongoing monitoring and adjustment throughout the year.

The budget process is a critical component of the U.S. political system, and plays a key role in shaping the government's financial policies. It is a complex and dynamic process, and understanding it is essential for anyone seeking to understand the U.S. budget for national security.





### Subsection 1.2c Budget Analysis

Budget analysis is a critical component of the budget process. It involves the examination of the budget to determine its impact on the economy, society, and the government itself. This analysis is conducted by a variety of actors, including government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and academic institutions.

#### Governmental Budget Analysis

The U.S. government conducts budget analysis at both the federal and state levels. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is responsible for analyzing the President's budget request and providing recommendations to the President. The OMB's analysis includes an examination of the budget's impact on the economy, as well as its compliance with budgetary rules and laws.

At the state level, budget analysis is conducted by the state's budget office. This office is responsible for analyzing the state's budget and providing recommendations to the governor and state legislature. The analysis includes an examination of the budget's impact on the state's economy, as well as its compliance with state budgetary rules and laws.

#### Non-Governmental Budget Analysis

Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) also conduct budget analysis. These organizations often have a specific policy or issue focus, and their analysis is typically directed towards that focus. For example, the Armenian Assembly of America conducts budget analysis with a focus on U.S. aid to Armenia. Similarly, the Institute for Policy Studies conducts budget analysis with a focus on income inequality and social justice.

#### Academic Budget Analysis

Academic institutions also conduct budget analysis. This analysis is typically conducted by economists and other social scientists, and it is often published in academic journals. The analysis is based on economic models and data, and it is used to inform policy debates and decisions.

For example, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) conducts budget analysis for Congress. The CBO's analysis includes projections of the budget's impact on the economy, as well as its compliance with budgetary rules and laws. The CBO's analysis is used by Congress to make decisions about the budget, and it is often cited in policy debates.

#### Budget Analysis in Practice

In practice, budget analysis involves a variety of methods and techniques. These include economic modeling, data analysis, and scenario analysis. Economic modeling involves the use of economic models to predict the budget's impact on the economy. Data analysis involves the use of statistical techniques to analyze budget data. Scenario analysis involves the use of scenarios to explore the potential outcomes of different budget decisions.

Budget analysis is a complex and ongoing process. It is conducted throughout the budget process, and it continues after the budget is passed into law. The results of the analysis are used to inform policy decisions and to monitor the budget's implementation.

### Section: 2.1 Composition of the Defense Budget:

The defense budget is a crucial component of the overall national security budget. It is responsible for funding the military and defense agencies that protect the United States and its interests around the world. In this section, we will explore the composition of the defense budget, including its key components and how they are allocated.

#### 2.1a Breakdown of Defense Budget

The defense budget is a complex and multifaceted entity, with numerous components and subcomponents. In this subsection, we will break down the defense budget into its key components, providing a comprehensive understanding of its composition.

The defense budget can be broadly categorized into two main components: the base budget and the overseas contingency operations (OCO) budget. The base budget covers the regular operations and maintenance of the military, while the OCO budget is used to fund military operations in overseas conflicts.

The base budget is further divided into several subcategories, including personnel, operations and maintenance, procurement, and research and development. Personnel costs cover the salaries and benefits of military personnel, while operations and maintenance costs cover the expenses for training, equipment, and facilities. Procurement costs cover the acquisition of new equipment and technology, while research and development costs cover the development of new technologies and weapons systems.

The OCO budget, on the other hand, is used to fund military operations in overseas conflicts. This includes costs for troops, equipment, and supplies, as well as expenses for intelligence gathering and analysis. The OCO budget is often subject to changes and adjustments, depending on the nature and scope of ongoing military operations.

In addition to the base budget and OCO budget, the defense budget also includes other smaller components, such as the Defense Health Program, which covers the healthcare costs of military personnel and their families, and the Defense Agency for Research and Technology, which funds research and development for emerging technologies.

The allocation of funds within the defense budget is determined by the Department of Defense, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget. The budget is then presented to Congress for approval, with the President's defense budget request serving as a starting point for negotiations and discussions.

### Subsection: 2.1c Trends in Defense Budget

The defense budget of the United States has been a topic of great interest and debate for many years. It is a complex and constantly evolving entity, shaped by a multitude of factors including political ideologies, international relations, and technological advancements. In this section, we will explore the trends in the defense budget, examining how it has changed over time and the implications of these changes.

#### Historical Trends

The defense budget has been a significant portion of the federal budget since World War II. In the 1950s, the defense budget represented approximately 10% of the GDP. However, with the onset of the Cold War, this figure increased dramatically, reaching a peak of 12% in the 1960s. The defense budget then declined throughout the 1970s and 1980s, reaching a low of 5% in the 1980s.

The end of the Cold War in the 1990s led to a significant reduction in the defense budget, which dropped to 3% of the GDP. However, the events of 9/11 and the subsequent War on Terror led to a significant increase in the defense budget, which reached 4% of the GDP in the early 2000s.

#### Recent Trends

In recent years, the defense budget has been relatively stable, hovering around 3% of the GDP. However, there have been significant changes in the composition of the defense budget. For instance, the budget for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO), which was used to fund military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, has been replaced by 'direct war and enduring costs'. This shift has led to a more transparent and accountable budget process.

#### Implications of Trends

The trends in the defense budget have significant implications for national security. The increase in the defense budget during the Cold War and the War on Terror was a direct response to perceived threats to national security. However, the stability of the defense budget in recent years suggests that the United States may be facing a more manageable set of security challenges.

Moreover, the shift in the composition of the defense budget towards 'direct war and enduring costs' reflects a shift in military strategy. This shift may have implications for the future of warfare and the role of the United States as a global superpower.

In conclusion, the defense budget is a complex and constantly evolving entity, shaped by a multitude of factors. By examining the historical and recent trends in the defense budget, we can gain a better understanding of the current and future challenges facing the United States in terms of national security.




### Subsection: 2.2a Political Pressures on Budget

Political pressures play a significant role in shaping the national security budget of the United States. These pressures are often influenced by the political ideologies of the ruling party, international relations, and public opinion. In this section, we will explore the political pressures on the budget, examining how they have influenced the allocation of resources and the overall budget process.

#### Political Ideologies

Political ideologies play a crucial role in shaping the national security budget. For instance, conservative ideologies often advocate for a strong military and a hawkish foreign policy, leading to increased defense spending. On the other hand, liberal ideologies may prioritize social programs and diplomacy over military spending. 

The political ideologies of the ruling party can significantly influence the budget process. For example, during the Obama administration, the Democratic Party's liberal ideology led to a shift in the budget allocation, with a greater emphasis on social programs and diplomacy. This shift was reflected in the budget, with a decrease in defense spending and an increase in spending on social programs and diplomacy.

#### International Relations

International relations also play a significant role in shaping the national security budget. The United States' role as a global superpower often requires it to maintain a strong military presence in various parts of the world. This can lead to increased defense spending, particularly in regions where there are ongoing conflicts or potential threats.

For instance, the War on Terror and the subsequent military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan led to a significant increase in the defense budget. The events of 9/11 and the subsequent threats to national security necessitated a strong military response, leading to increased defense spending.

#### Public Opinion

Public opinion also plays a crucial role in shaping the national security budget. Public support for military operations and defense spending can influence the budget process. For instance, during the War on Terror, public support for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan led to increased defense spending. However, as public support waned, there was a shift in the budget allocation, with a decrease in defense spending.

In conclusion, political pressures, including political ideologies, international relations, and public opinion, play a significant role in shaping the national security budget of the United States. These pressures can influence the allocation of resources and the overall budget process, leading to significant changes in the budget over time.




### Subsection: 2.2b Economic Pressures on Budget

Economic pressures play a significant role in shaping the national security budget of the United States. These pressures are often influenced by the state of the economy, inflation, and the national debt. In this section, we will explore the economic pressures on the budget, examining how they have influenced the allocation of resources and the overall budget process.

#### State of the Economy

The state of the economy is a crucial factor in determining the budget allocation. During times of economic growth, the government often experiences an increase in tax revenue, which can lead to an increase in the defense budget. However, during times of economic recession, tax revenue decreases, leading to a decrease in the defense budget.

For instance, during the 2008 global financial crisis, the United States experienced a significant decrease in tax revenue, leading to a decrease in the defense budget. This was necessary to balance the budget and prevent a further increase in the national debt.

#### Inflation

Inflation is another important economic factor that influences the budget allocation. Inflation refers to the general increase in prices of goods and services in an economy. When inflation is high, the government often increases defense spending to stimulate the economy and create jobs. However, high inflation can also lead to an increase in the national debt, which can have long-term consequences for the economy.

For example, during the 1970s, the United States experienced high inflation, leading to an increase in defense spending. However, this increase in defense spending also led to an increase in the national debt, which had long-term consequences for the economy.

#### National Debt

The national debt is a significant economic pressure on the budget. The national debt refers to the total amount of money that the government owes to its creditors. When the national debt is high, it can lead to increased interest payments, which can put pressure on the budget.

For instance, during the 2008 global financial crisis, the United States experienced a significant increase in the national debt. This increase in the national debt led to an increase in interest payments, putting pressure on the budget. To address this issue, the government implemented various measures, including a pay freeze for public sector workers and a two-year pay freeze for members of the armed forces.

In conclusion, economic pressures play a significant role in shaping the national security budget of the United States. The state of the economy, inflation, and the national debt are all important factors that influence the allocation of resources and the overall budget process. Understanding these economic pressures is crucial for understanding the budget allocation and the overall budget process.




### Subsection: 2.2c Social Pressures on Budget

Social pressures also play a significant role in shaping the national security budget of the United States. These pressures are often influenced by societal values, public opinion, and political ideologies. In this section, we will explore the social pressures on the budget, examining how they have influenced the allocation of resources and the overall budget process.

#### Societal Values

Societal values are a crucial factor in determining the budget allocation. These values are often reflected in the priorities of the government and its citizens. For instance, in the United States, there is a strong emphasis on national security and defense, which is reflected in the high defense budget. However, there is also a growing concern for social issues such as healthcare and education, which can lead to increased spending in these areas.

#### Public Opinion

Public opinion is another important social factor that influences the budget allocation. The government is accountable to its citizens, and their opinions can have a significant impact on the budget process. For example, during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, there was a significant shift in public opinion towards increased defense spending. This led to an increase in the defense budget, despite economic concerns.

#### Political Ideologies

Political ideologies also play a role in shaping the budget allocation. Different political parties have different priorities and beliefs, which can lead to varying budget proposals. For instance, conservative parties often prioritize defense and law enforcement, while liberal parties may prioritize social programs and education. These ideologies can also influence the overall budget process, as they can shape the public discourse and influence public opinion.

In conclusion, social pressures, such as societal values, public opinion, and political ideologies, play a crucial role in shaping the national security budget of the United States. These pressures can influence the allocation of resources and the overall budget process, making it essential for policymakers to consider them when making budget decisions. 





### Subsection: 2.3a Fiscal Constraints

Fiscal constraints are a critical aspect of the budget process, as they limit the amount of resources available for allocation. These constraints are often imposed by external factors such as economic conditions, debt levels, and international obligations. In this section, we will explore the various fiscal constraints that impact the national security budget of the United States.

#### Economic Conditions

The state of the economy plays a significant role in shaping the fiscal constraints on the budget. During periods of economic growth, the government may have more resources available for allocation, allowing for increased spending. However, during economic downturns, resources may be scarce, leading to tough decisions about budget allocation. For instance, during the 2008 global financial crisis, the United States faced significant budget constraints due to the economic downturn. This led to a decrease in defense spending and an increase in social spending, as the government sought to stimulate the economy.

#### Debt Levels

The level of national debt is another crucial factor in determining fiscal constraints. The United States has one of the highest levels of national debt in the world, which can limit the amount of resources available for allocation. The government must balance its spending with its ability to pay back its debts, which can be challenging during times of economic stress. This can lead to tough decisions about budget allocation, as the government must prioritize its spending to meet its financial obligations.

#### International Obligations

The United States has numerous international obligations, such as NATO membership and foreign aid commitments, which can also impact its fiscal constraints. These obligations require the government to allocate resources towards meeting its international commitments, which can limit the amount of resources available for domestic spending. For instance, the United States has a significant defense budget to maintain its global military presence and meet its NATO obligations. This can limit the amount of resources available for other domestic priorities, such as healthcare and education.

In conclusion, fiscal constraints play a crucial role in shaping the national security budget of the United States. These constraints are often imposed by external factors and can lead to tough decisions about budget allocation. Understanding these constraints is essential for analyzing the budget process and its impact on national security.




### Subsection: 2.3b Political Considerations

Political considerations play a significant role in shaping the national security budget of the United States. The budget process is heavily influenced by political ideologies, party affiliations, and public opinion. In this section, we will explore the various political considerations that impact the national security budget.

#### Political Ideologies

Political ideologies, such as liberalism and conservatism, have a significant impact on the budget process. Liberals tend to favor government intervention and spending, while conservatives advocate for limited government and lower taxes. These ideologies can influence the allocation of resources and the overall size of the budget. For instance, during the Obama administration, liberal ideologies led to an increase in government spending, particularly in the areas of healthcare and education.

#### Party Affiliations

The political party in power also plays a crucial role in shaping the budget. The party in power has control over the budget process and can use its majority to push through its priorities. This can lead to partisan budgets, where one party's priorities are heavily emphasized at the expense of the other party's. For example, during the Trump administration, the Republican majority in Congress passed a tax cut bill that significantly reduced government revenue, leading to concerns about the national debt.

#### Public Opinion

Public opinion also plays a significant role in shaping the budget process. The government must consider public sentiment when making budget decisions, as it can impact public support for the budget. For instance, during the Obama administration, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was a major point of contention, with many Americans opposed to the increased government involvement in healthcare. This led to a decrease in public support for the budget and a shift in priorities towards other issues.

In conclusion, political considerations play a crucial role in shaping the national security budget of the United States. The interplay between political ideologies, party affiliations, and public opinion can lead to complex and often contentious budget decisions. As we continue to face challenges in the global arena, it is essential to understand the role of these political considerations in shaping our national security budget.

To assess the financial burden of the war, economists have used various methods, including cost-benefit analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis. Cost-benefit analysis compares the costs of the war to the benefits it has provided, while cost-effectiveness analysis compares the costs to the outcomes achieved. Both methods have been used to evaluate the war in Iraq and its impact on the U.S. budget for national security.

One of the main challenges in assessing the financial burden of the war is the lack of accurate and comprehensive data. The U.S. government has not provided a complete accounting of the costs of the war, making it difficult for economists to calculate the total financial burden. Additionally, the long-term effects of the war on the U.S. economy and national security budget are still unknown, making it challenging to determine the full impact of the war.

Despite these challenges, economists have estimated that the war in Iraq has had a significant impact on the U.S. budget for national security. The war has depleted the U.S. military's resources, including equipment and personnel, which will require significant funding to replenish. Additionally, the war has also led to an increase in defense spending, as the U.S. has had to allocate more resources to protect its troops and maintain its military presence in the region.

In conclusion, the war in Iraq has been a significant financial burden on the United States' national security budget. The direct and indirect costs of the war have had a long-term impact on the U.S. economy and its ability to fund other national security priorities. It is crucial for policymakers to carefully assess the financial burden of the war and make informed decisions about future military operations.

This budget request includes funding for various components of the DHS, including the U.S. Coast Guard, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

One of the key factors in analyzing the DHS budget is understanding the priorities of the department. The DHS has identified four main priorities for fiscal year 2018: securing the border, enforcing immigration laws, protecting critical infrastructure, and responding to natural disasters. These priorities align with the overall mission of the DHS, which is to protect the nation from terrorist threats and natural disasters.

However, there have been concerns raised about the effectiveness of the DHS in achieving these priorities. For example, in 2017, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report highlighting weaknesses in the DHS's management and oversight of its budget. The report found that the DHS lacked a comprehensive plan for managing its budget and had inadequate controls in place to ensure the proper use of funds.

Furthermore, there have been concerns about the impact of budget cuts on the DHS's ability to carry out its mission. In 2017, the DHS faced a budget shortfall of $1 billion, leading to furloughs and reduced services. This has raised questions about the department's ability to effectively protect the nation in the face of potential threats.

In addition to budget concerns, there have also been criticisms of the DHS's priorities. Some argue that the department's focus on securing the border and enforcing immigration laws has come at the expense of protecting critical infrastructure and responding to natural disasters. This has led to calls for a reassessment of the DHS's priorities and a more balanced approach to addressing all four of its identified priorities.

In conclusion, analyzing the DHS budget and priorities is crucial in understanding the effectiveness of the department. While the DHS has identified important priorities, there are concerns about its management of funds and the impact of budget cuts on its ability to carry out its mission.

This has raised questions about the department's ability to effectively protect the nation in the face of potential threats.

In addition to budget concerns, there have been debates and discussions surrounding the DHS's budget. For instance, in November 2017, the full Homeland Security Committee held a hearing to understand how fast the U.S. government could install CT scanners into every airport in the country in order to fight threats to airlines. The hearing focused on the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) role in keeping the country secure. The hearing was scheduled because a classified security briefing that was held earlier revealed vulnerabilities to the aviation system that concerned committee members. The latest threats, according to committee Chairman Michael McCaul, "were terrorists using explosives hidden in consumer electronics, such as laptops and tablets, to bring down commercial airliners."

The hearing also addressed the TSA's role in protecting critical infrastructure, such as airports and airlines. The TSA is responsible for screening passengers and baggage at airports, as well as conducting security audits and inspections of airlines. However, there have been concerns about the TSA's effectiveness in carrying out these responsibilities. For example, in 2017, the GAO issued a report finding that the TSA had not fully implemented recommendations to improve its risk-based passenger and baggage screening processes.

The hearing also touched on the DHS's budget for fiscal year 2018, with committee members expressing concerns about the proposed cuts to local security programs. These cuts would affect security programs for New York's first responders, as well as the ports of Elizabeth and Newark. The committee members also questioned how the cuts would help keep the country safe from terrorist threats and natural disasters.

In conclusion, the DHS's budget and priorities are crucial to understanding its effectiveness in protecting the nation. While there have been concerns raised about the department's management and oversight of its budget, as well as its ability to carry out its mission, the DHS continues to play a vital role in keeping the country safe from terrorist threats and natural disasters.

### Subsection: 7.1a Diplomacy Budget Analysis

The budget for diplomacy is a crucial component of the overall federal budget, as it directly impacts the United States' ability to engage with the world and achieve its national security objectives. In this section, we will analyze the budget for diplomacy, including its components, trends, and challenges.

#### Components of the Diplomacy Budget

The budget for diplomacy includes funding for various activities, including maintaining diplomatic relations, promoting economic development, and providing humanitarian aid. The State Department, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and military aid are some of the key components of this budget.

The State Department's budget includes funding for diplomatic missions, consular services, and international assistance programs. The USAID's budget, on the other hand, focuses on long-term development assistance and humanitarian aid. Military aid, often provided through the Department of Defense, is used to support allied militaries and promote stability in key regions.

#### Trends in Diplomacy Budget

Historically, the budget for diplomacy has been a small portion of the overall federal budget, typically less than 1% of total spending. However, there have been significant increases in recent years, particularly in response to global crises such as the Syrian civil war and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.

In fiscal year 2015, the State Department's operating budget, including salaries, was approximately $161 million. The total FY 2015 foreign assistance funding for USAID was approximately $7 billion. These figures highlight the significant resources allocated to diplomacy and foreign aid.

#### Challenges in Diplomacy Budget

Despite the increasing funding, there are significant challenges in the diplomacy budget. One of the main challenges is the effectiveness of aid programs. Critics argue that much of the aid is wasted due to corruption and mismanagement. There are also concerns about the balance between humanitarian and strategic objectives in the budget.

Furthermore, the budget for diplomacy is often a target for budget cuts during times of fiscal austerity. This can limit the U.S.'s ability to engage with the world and achieve its national security objectives.

In conclusion, the budget for diplomacy is a critical component of the overall federal budget. It includes funding for various activities and has seen significant increases in recent years. However, there are also challenges that need to be addressed to ensure the effectiveness of the budget.




### Subsection: 7.1b Budget Priorities for Diplomacy

The budget for diplomacy is a crucial aspect of the overall federal budget, as it directly impacts the United States' ability to engage with the world and achieve its national security objectives. In this section, we will discuss the budget priorities for diplomacy, including the key factors that influence these priorities and the challenges that arise in implementing them.

#### Key Factors Influencing Budget Priorities for Diplomacy

The budget priorities for diplomacy are influenced by a variety of factors, including global events, national security objectives, and resource allocation. Global events such as conflicts, natural disasters, and economic crises can significantly impact the budget priorities for diplomacy. For instance, the Syrian civil war and the Ebola outbreak in West Africa led to significant increases in the diplomacy budget in recent years.

National security objectives also play a crucial role in determining budget priorities for diplomacy. The United States has a long-standing commitment to promoting democracy, human rights, and economic development around the world. These objectives often require significant resources, which can influence the budget priorities for diplomacy.

Resource allocation is another key factor that influences budget priorities for diplomacy. The overall size of the diplomacy budget is limited by the overall size of the federal budget. Therefore, competing priorities within the federal budget can impact the allocation of resources for diplomacy. For example, the increasing costs of defense and domestic programs can limit the resources available for diplomacy.

#### Challenges in Implementing Budget Priorities for Diplomacy

Despite the importance of diplomacy, there are significant challenges in implementing budget priorities for diplomacy. One of the main challenges is the effectiveness of aid programs. Critics argue that much of the aid is wasted due to corruption and mismanagement. This can lead to calls for reducing the budget for diplomacy, which can be difficult to justify given the global events and national security objectives that influence these budget priorities.

Another challenge is the need for long-term planning and investment in diplomacy. Diplomacy is often seen as a short-term solution to global problems, leading to a focus on immediate needs and crises. However, long-term planning and investment are crucial for achieving national security objectives and promoting stability around the world. This can be a challenge in a budget environment where short-term needs and crises often take priority.

In conclusion, the budget priorities for diplomacy are influenced by a variety of factors, including global events, national security objectives, and resource allocation. Despite these challenges, it is crucial for the United States to maintain a strong diplomacy budget to achieve its national security objectives and promote stability around the world.

### Conclusion

### Subsection: 7.1c Impact of Budget on Diplomacy

The budget for diplomacy has a significant impact on the United States' ability to engage with the world and achieve its national security objectives. The budget not only determines the resources available for diplomatic efforts but also shapes the priorities and strategies of diplomacy.

#### Resource Allocation and Diplomacy

The budget for diplomacy is a reflection of the United States' commitment to global affairs. The size of the budget is a direct indicator of the resources allocated to diplomacy, which in turn determines the scope and effectiveness of diplomatic efforts. For instance, a larger budget can support more diplomatic missions, more personnel, and a wider range of diplomatic activities.

However, the budget for diplomacy is not unlimited. It is subject to the overall size of the federal budget, which is influenced by a variety of factors, including defense spending, domestic programs, and economic conditions. Therefore, changes in the budget for diplomacy can be influenced by changes in these other areas. For example, an increase in defense spending can lead to a decrease in the budget for diplomacy, as resources are reallocated to defense.

#### Budget Priorities and Diplomacy

The budget priorities for diplomacy can also have a significant impact on diplomatic efforts. As discussed in the previous section, global events, national security objectives, and resource allocation are key factors that influence budget priorities for diplomacy. These priorities can shape the strategies and objectives of diplomacy, as well as the allocation of resources within the diplomacy budget.

For instance, a global event such as a conflict or a natural disaster can lead to a significant increase in the budget for diplomacy. This increase can be used to support diplomatic efforts to address the event, such as peacekeeping operations or humanitarian aid. Similarly, a change in national security objectives, such as a shift towards promoting economic development, can lead to a change in budget priorities for diplomacy.

#### Challenges in Implementing Budget Priorities for Diplomacy

Despite the importance of diplomacy, there are significant challenges in implementing budget priorities for diplomacy. One of the main challenges is the effectiveness of aid programs. Critics argue that much of the aid is wasted due to corruption, lack of accountability, and inadequate monitoring and evaluation. This can lead to a decrease in the budget for diplomacy, as resources are reallocated to address these issues.

Another challenge is the competition for resources within the federal budget. As mentioned earlier, the budget for diplomacy is subject to the overall size of the federal budget. Therefore, changes in other areas of the budget, such as defense or domestic programs, can have a direct impact on the budget for diplomacy. This competition for resources can make it difficult to maintain a consistent and effective budget for diplomacy.

In conclusion, the budget for diplomacy plays a crucial role in shaping the United States' engagement with the world and its ability to achieve its national security objectives. Changes in the budget can be influenced by a variety of factors, including global events, national security objectives, and resource allocation. However, there are also significant challenges in implementing budget priorities for diplomacy, which can impact the effectiveness of diplomatic efforts. 





### Subsection: 7.2a Foreign Aid Budget Analysis

The budget for foreign aid is influenced by a variety of factors, including global events, national security objectives, and resource allocation. In this section, we will delve into the details of the foreign aid budget, including its size, allocation, and impact on national security.

#### Size of the Foreign Aid Budget

The size of the foreign aid budget is a direct reflection of the United States' commitment to global development and stability. It is also a function of the nation's economic health and its global responsibilities. The budget for foreign aid is influenced by a variety of factors, including the overall size of the federal budget, defense spending, and domestic programs.

In fiscal year 2015, the United States allocated approximately $37 billion for foreign aid, representing a significant portion of the overall federal budget. This allocation was made across various agencies, including the Department of State, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Department of Defense.

#### Allocation of the Foreign Aid Budget

The allocation of the foreign aid budget is guided by the nation's diplomatic and security objectives. The budget is allocated to various programs and initiatives that support these objectives. For instance, a significant portion of the budget is allocated to programs that promote economic development, democracy, and human rights in developing countries.

The budget is also allocated to programs that support regional stability and security, such as peacekeeping operations and counterterrorism efforts. For example, in fiscal year 2015, the United States allocated approximately $1.5 billion for peacekeeping operations and $2.5 billion for counterterrorism efforts.

#### Impact of the Foreign Aid Budget on National Security

The foreign aid budget plays a crucial role in promoting national security. It supports initiatives that enhance global stability and reduce threats to the United States. For instance, economic development programs can help reduce poverty and instability, which can in turn reduce the risk of conflict and terrorism.

Moreover, the foreign aid budget supports initiatives that promote democracy and human rights, which can help reduce the appeal of extremism and terrorism. It also supports initiatives that promote regional stability and security, such as peacekeeping operations and counterterrorism efforts.

However, the effectiveness of the foreign aid budget can be limited by factors such as aid fragmentation and volatility.

Foreign aid plays a crucial role in maintaining national security. It is a tool that the United States uses to promote its interests and protect its citizens both at home and abroad. The impact of foreign aid on national security can be seen in various ways, including its role in promoting stability, countering terrorism, and advancing U.S. interests.

#### Promoting Stability

Foreign aid is a key component of the United States' strategy for promoting stability around the world. By providing aid to developing countries, the U.S. helps to address the root causes of instability, such as poverty, lack of economic opportunity, and political instability. This, in turn, helps to reduce the risk of conflict and instability, which can have direct implications for U.S. national security.

For instance, the U.S. has used foreign aid to support economic development and democracy in countries like Afghanistan and Iraq. By promoting economic growth and political stability, the U.S. has sought to create a more secure environment for its citizens and its interests in these countries.

#### Countering Terrorism

Foreign aid also plays a critical role in the U.S.'s efforts to counter terrorism. By providing aid to countries that are facing terrorist threats, the U.S. helps to build their capacity to fight terrorism and protect their citizens. This can include training and equipment for military and security forces, as well as support for counterterrorism efforts.

For example, the U.S. has provided significant aid to countries like Pakistan and Yemen to help them combat terrorist threats. This aid has been crucial in these countries' efforts to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks, thereby reducing the risk of terrorism to U.S. citizens and interests.

#### Advancing U.S. Interests

Finally, foreign aid serves to advance U.S. interests around the world. By providing aid, the U.S. can build relationships and influence with other countries, which can be crucial for promoting its interests and protecting its citizens. For instance, the U.S. has used foreign aid to build strong relationships with key allies like Israel and Egypt, which have been crucial for U.S. interests in the Middle East.

In conclusion, foreign aid plays a crucial role in maintaining U.S. national security. By promoting stability, countering terrorism, and advancing U.S. interests, foreign aid helps to protect U.S. citizens and its interests around the world. However, it is important for the U.S. to ensure that its foreign aid is effective and well-targeted, in order to maximize its impact on national security.

### Subsection: 7.2c Evaluation of Foreign Aid Budget

The evaluation of the foreign aid budget is a critical aspect of understanding the impact of foreign aid on national security. This evaluation involves assessing the effectiveness of the aid in achieving its intended objectives, as well as identifying areas for improvement and optimization.

#### Aid Effectiveness

Aid effectiveness is a measure of the extent to which aid contributes to the development objectives of the recipient country. It is often assessed using indicators such as the aid-to-GDP ratio, the aid-to-trade ratio, and the aid-to-investment ratio. These indicators provide a broad overview of the scale and impact of aid, but they do not capture the full complexity of aid effectiveness.

Aid effectiveness is also influenced by factors such as the quality of aid, the alignment of aid with the recipient country's priorities, and the capacity of the recipient country to absorb and use aid effectively. These factors can significantly impact the overall effectiveness of aid and, consequently, its impact on national security.

#### Aid Fragmentation

Aid fragmentation refers to the proliferation of donors and projects, which can lead to inefficiencies and duplication of efforts. This can result in increased costs for recipient countries and reduced aid effectiveness. Aid fragmentation can also lead to a lack of coordination and cooperation among donors, which can hinder the overall impact of aid.

To address aid fragmentation, the United States has implemented various initiatives, such as the Foreign Assistance Dashboard and the Global Development Lab, to improve aid coordination and effectiveness. These initiatives aim to promote a more strategic and coordinated approach to foreign aid, which can enhance its impact on national security.

#### Aid Volatility

Aid volatility refers to the unpredictability of aid flows, which can make it difficult for recipient countries to plan and implement development projects. This can lead to delays, inefficiencies, and increased costs. Aid volatility can also undermine the accountability of governments, as they may be less accountable for the use of aid if they cannot be certain of its availability.

To address aid volatility, the United States has implemented various measures, such as the Aid Transparency and Accountability Act and the Aid Management Platform, to improve aid predictability and accountability. These measures aim to enhance the effectiveness of aid and its impact on national security.

In conclusion, the evaluation of the foreign aid budget is a complex and multifaceted process that involves assessing aid effectiveness, addressing aid fragmentation and volatility, and implementing measures to improve aid coordination and accountability. This evaluation is crucial for understanding the impact of foreign aid on national security and for optimizing its effectiveness.

The United States, with its strong economy, culture, and values, has traditionally been a major source of soft power. However, as other countries, such as China and India, rise in economic and political influence, the United States will need to adapt and strengthen its soft power to maintain its diplomatic influence.

This will require a shift in diplomatic strategy, with a greater emphasis on cultural diplomacy, public diplomacy, and people-to-people exchanges. It will also require a deeper understanding of the values and interests of other countries, and the ability to effectively communicate and engage with them.

#### The Need for Collaborative Diplomacy

The complexity of global issues, such as climate change, terrorism, and global health, requires a collaborative approach to diplomacy. This involves not only cooperation among diplomats, but also collaboration with other stakeholders, such as civil society, the private sector, and academic institutions.

Collaborative diplomacy requires a shift from traditional, state-centric approaches to diplomacy, towards more inclusive and participatory approaches. It also requires a willingness to engage in dialogue and compromise, and a commitment to long-term solutions rather than short-term gains.

In conclusion, the future of diplomacy will likely involve a greater integration of technology, a focus on soft power, and a shift towards collaborative diplomacy. These developments will require diplomats to adapt and evolve, and they will also require a rethinking of diplomatic strategies and priorities. As we move forward, it is crucial to continue evaluating and learning from diplomatic efforts, to ensure that our diplomacy is effective and responsive to the changing global landscape.

### Section: 8.1 Analyzing Alternative Plans and Their Policy Implications:

#### 8.1a Analysis of Alternative National Security Plans

The analysis of alternative national security plans is a critical step in the decision-making process. It allows for a comprehensive evaluation of different strategies and policies, providing a platform for informed decision-making. This section will explore the various factors that influence the analysis of these plans, including political considerations, economic constraints, and international relations.

One of the key factors in the analysis of alternative national security plans is the political climate. The political ideologies of the ruling party and the opposition can significantly influence the direction of these plans. For instance, the Obama administration's deficit reduction plan and the "Defense Strategic Guidance" document were heavily influenced by the political climate at the time. The administration's focus on cost containment and the shift away from large-scale ground invasions can be seen as a response to the political climate, which emphasized fiscal responsibility and a shift away from nation-building.

Economic constraints also play a significant role in the analysis of alternative national security plans. The Obama administration's deficit reduction plan, for instance, involved reducing the growth of security spending by four percent from previously planned increases. This cost containment was necessary to address the growing deficit and was a key factor in the administration's national security strategy. The analysis of alternative plans must take into account these economic constraints and their potential implications for national security.

International relations also influence the analysis of alternative national security plans. The shift in the Pentagon's doctrine from being able to wage two wars simultaneously to a focus on being able to confront more than one threat at a time can be seen as a response to the changing international landscape. The rise of new threats and the changing nature of warfare necessitated a shift in strategy, which was reflected in the analysis of alternative plans.

In conclusion, the analysis of alternative national security plans is a complex process that involves considering a wide range of factors. Political considerations, economic constraints, and international relations all play a significant role in this process. By understanding these factors and their implications, policymakers can make informed decisions about the direction of national security strategy.

#### 8.1b Policy Implications of Alternative Plans

The policy implications of alternative national security plans are far-reaching and can have significant impacts on various aspects of national security. The Obama administration's deficit reduction plan and the "Defense Strategic Guidance" document, for instance, had profound policy implications that shaped the administration's national security strategy.

One of the key policy implications of these plans was the shift in the Pentagon's doctrine. The administration's focus on cost containment and the shift away from large-scale ground invasions resulted in a new doctrine that emphasized the ability to confront more than one threat at a time. This shift was a direct response to the changing nature of warfare and the rise of new threats.

### Subsection: 8.2a Comparison of National Security Approaches

In the previous section, we discussed the evaluation of alternative national security plans. In this section, we will delve deeper into the comparison of different approaches to national security. 

The United States has a long history of employing various approaches to national security. These approaches have been shaped by the country's strategic interests, geopolitical environment, and technological advancements. In this subsection, we will compare and contrast two of these approaches: the traditional approach and the modern approach.

#### 8.2a.1 Traditional Approach

The traditional approach to national security is characterized by a heavy reliance on military power and a focus on territorial defense. This approach was prevalent during the Cold War era, when the United States was engaged in a direct military competition with the Soviet Union. The traditional approach emphasizes the use of military force to deter and defeat adversaries, and it is often associated with the concept of "containment".

The traditional approach is based on the assumption that the primary threat to national security is a direct military attack. Therefore, the main focus is on building a strong military capability, including large-scale ground invasions and nuclear deterrence. This approach also involves alliances and partnerships with other countries, particularly with like-minded powers, to enhance collective security.

#### 8.2a.2 Modern Approach

The modern approach to national security is characterized by a shift away from traditional military power and a greater emphasis on non-military tools and strategies. This approach is a response to the changing nature of modern warfare, which is characterized by the use of asymmetric tactics, cyber warfare, and the involvement of non-state actors.

The modern approach emphasizes the use of non-military tools such as diplomacy, economic sanctions, and intelligence gathering. It also involves a greater focus on soft power and public diplomacy, as well as the use of technology and innovation to enhance national security. This approach is often associated with the concept of "smart power", which combines hard and soft power to achieve national security objectives.

#### 8.2a.3 Comparison and Contrast

The traditional and modern approaches to national security offer different perspectives on how to protect the nation. The traditional approach is based on the assumption that the primary threat to national security is a direct military attack, and it emphasizes the use of military power to deter and defeat adversaries. The modern approach, on the other hand, recognizes the changing nature of modern warfare and emphasizes the use of non-military tools and strategies.

While the traditional approach has been effective in deterring direct military attacks, it may not be as effective in dealing with the complex and multifaceted threats of the modern era. The modern approach, on the other hand, offers a more comprehensive and adaptable approach to national security, but it also presents new challenges and complexities.

In the next section, we will explore these challenges and complexities in more detail, and discuss how they can be addressed in the development of alternative national security plans.

However, the modern approach, with its focus on non-military tools, has led to a shift in U.S. foreign policy towards a more diplomatic and economic approach.

#### 8.2b.1 Impact of the Traditional Approach

The traditional approach to national security has had a profound impact on the U.S.'s military capabilities and foreign policy decisions. The U.S.'s large-scale ground invasions and nuclear deterrence strategies, which are key components of this approach, have been instrumental in deterring potential adversaries and maintaining global power. However, the traditional approach has also been criticized for its reliance on military force and its potential for escalation.

The traditional approach has also been a key factor in the U.S.'s involvement in conflicts such as the Cold War and the War on Terror. During the Cold War, the U.S. and the Soviet Union engaged in a direct military competition, with the U.S. relying on its military power to contain the Soviet threat. Similarly, in the War on Terror, the U.S. has used military force to combat terrorism, with operations in Afghanistan and Iraq being prime examples.

#### 8.2b.2 Impact of the Modern Approach

The modern approach to national security, with its emphasis on non-military tools, has led to a shift in U.S. foreign policy towards a more diplomatic and economic approach. This approach has been particularly effective in dealing with non-state actors and asymmetric threats, which are often beyond the reach of traditional military power.

The modern approach has also led to a greater emphasis on international partnerships and alliances. The U.S. has increasingly relied on diplomatic and economic tools to achieve its strategic objectives, and has sought to build partnerships with other countries to enhance collective security. This approach has been particularly evident in the U.S.'s involvement in conflicts such as the War in Afghanistan, where the U.S. has relied on international partnerships and economic aid to achieve its objectives.

In conclusion, the impact of different approaches to national security can be seen in the U.S.'s foreign policy decisions and military strategies. The traditional approach, with its emphasis on military power, has been a key factor in the U.S.'s involvement in conflicts such as the Cold War and the War on Terror. The modern approach, with its focus on non-military tools, has led to a shift in U.S. foreign policy towards a more diplomatic and economic approach.

# Small unit tactics

## Combat Strategy and Phases

### Assault

The two major techniques of squad assault are bounded fire and advancing under the cover of suppressive fire of supporting units. Bounded fire entails having one element of the squad provide covering fire and field obscuration while the second element maneuvers forward to provide covering fire that allows the first element to leapfrog forward. This process is repeated until the maneuver element is in grenade range of the enemy positions. Advancing under the cover of supporting units requires the squad to stealthily advance towards the enemy position from a weakly held sector after the enemy has been suppressed by overwhelming fire. Once the squad has closed with the enemy it uses grenades and squad automatic fire to engage the enemy. This allows sufficient disruption of the enemy's control of their defensive front to allow other squads to advance unopposed.
United States Marines squads are arranged into "Buddy Pairs" and will assault in "Buddy Rushes", ensuring that one Marine is firing at the enemy while the other is maneuvering.

### Interim

In this phase the squad consolidates its position by entrenchment, construction of fortifications, creation of passageways between structures and forward reconnaissance of surrounding areas. Minor chemical decontamination will commence as seals, respirators and masks are checked for damage. Body armor will be examined to replace damaged ceramic plates. Casualties will be treated, evacuated and/or replaced. The squad will use this period to familiarise itself with its surroundings, dig in to defensible positions, recharge itself, repair any damage to itself and prepare either for the next offensive movement, or go on the defensive against a counterattack.

### Defensive

On the defensive, an isolated squad will allow a small element to hold a weak and easily evacuated position behind a remote detonated mine, flanked by a machine gun. As the enemy advances, the squad will use its defensive position to engage the enemy and prevent them from advancing further. This will allow the rest of the squad to retreat and regroup, preparing for a counterattack.

The DoD component that oversees the JCIDS analyses acts as the "sponsor". The sponsor also evaluates the affordability of various proposals and approaches determined in the study. Moreover, the sponsor coordinates with non-DoD departments and agencies on interagency capability matters.

The Joint Staff, J8, Vice Director (VDJ-8), is the "gatekeeper" of the JCIDS process. The gatekeeper assigns the Joint Potential Designation (JPD), and assigns lead and supporting functional capabilities boards FCBs, and performs an initial review. The gatekeeper initially reviews all proposals, and then designates the JPD, and which Functional Capability Board and Joint Warfighting Capability Assessment Teams will receive the proposal. The Joint Potential Designation is based on input from Joint Forces Command, each of the Joint Warfighting Capability Assessment teams, and other elements of the Joint Staff. The gatekeeper periodically reevaluates the Joint Potential designation throughout the process because changes in the proposed capability may require it to change as well.

When the gatekeeper has completed the initial review, she or he assigns the analysis to a "functional capabilities board" (FCB). This board replaces the joint requirements panel (JRP) from the previous system, with expanded responsibilities and membership. The FCB is responsible for ensuring that new capabilities are developed with a joint warfighting context; ensuring that proposals are consistent with the Joint Force as described in the Joint Operating Concepts; validating Joint Impact proposals; and assessing the effectiveness of defense personnel investments.

The Defense Operations and Maintenance Budget Analysis is a comprehensive study that examines the allocation of funds for defense operations and maintenance. It provides a detailed breakdown of the budget, including the budget for each military department, as well as the budget for Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) and direct war and enduring costs.

The analysis also includes the Unfunded priorities/requirements lists for the Congressional Armed Services Committees, which provide a glimpse into the military departments' future needs and plans. These lists are crucial for the budget process, as they help Congress and the Department of Defense (DoD) understand the military's current and future needs, and allocate resources accordingly.

The Defense Operations and Maintenance Budget Analysis is a complex and dynamic document, reflecting the constantly evolving nature of defense operations and maintenance. It is a critical tool for policymakers, military leaders, and defense analysts, providing them with the information they need to make informed decisions about defense funding and policy.

#### 15.2b Defense Operations and Maintenance Budget Allocation

The allocation of funds for defense operations and maintenance is a complex process that involves multiple factors. These include the nature of the operations, the type of equipment used, the geographical location of the operations, and the specific needs of the military departments.

The budget allocation process begins with the submission of the President's defense budget request to Congress. This request is then reviewed by the Congressional Armed Services Committees, who make recommendations for changes to the budget. The final budget is then passed by Congress and signed into law by the President.

The budget allocation process also involves the use of various budgetary tools and techniques. These include the use of budget envelopes, which are predetermined amounts of funding allocated to specific areas of the budget. The use of budget envelopes helps to control spending and ensure that funds are allocated in a manner that aligns with the overall budget priorities.

Another important tool in the budget allocation process is the use of budget constraints. These are limits placed on the amount of funding that can be allocated to a particular area of the budget. Budget constraints are used to ensure that funds are allocated in a manner that is consistent with the overall budget priorities and constraints.

In addition to budget envelopes and constraints, the budget allocation process also involves the use of budget priorities. These are the areas of the budget that are deemed to be the most important and are given the highest priority for funding. Budget priorities are determined based on a variety of factors, including national security needs, economic considerations, and political priorities.

The allocation of funds for defense operations and maintenance is a complex and dynamic process that involves multiple factors and tools. It is crucial for ensuring the readiness and effectiveness of the U.S. military, and is a critical aspect of the U.S. budget process.

#### 15.2c Case Studies of Defense Operations and Maintenance Budget Allocation

To further illustrate the process of budget allocation for defense operations and maintenance, let's examine two case studies: the budget allocation for the Department of Defense (DoD) and the budget allocation for the Department of Energy (DoE).

The DoD is the largest consumer of defense funds in the U.S. budget. The budget allocation for the DoD is determined by the President's defense budget request, which is then reviewed and amended by the Congressional Armed Services Committees. The final budget allocation for the DoD is then passed by Congress and signed into law by the President.

The budget allocation for the DoD is influenced by various factors, including the nature of the operations, the type of equipment used, the geographical location of the operations, and the specific needs of the military departments. For example, the Army's portion of the budget request, $173 billion, dropped $3.6 billion from the enacted FY2021 budget, while the Navy's portion of the budget request, $211.7 billion, rose 1.8% from the enacted FY2021 budget.

The DoE, on the other hand, is responsible for managing the U.S. nuclear arsenal and ensuring the safety and security of nuclear materials. The budget allocation for the DoE is also determined by the President's budget request, which is then reviewed and amended by Congress. The final budget allocation for the DoE is then passed by Congress and signed into law by the President.

The budget allocation for the DoE is influenced by various factors, including the need for nuclear deterrence, the cost of maintaining and upgrading nuclear weapons, and the cost of nuclear energy research and development. The DoE's budget request for FY2022, $35.1 billion, is a 10.7% increase from the enacted FY2021 budget, reflecting the growing importance of nuclear energy in the U.S. energy mix.

These case studies illustrate the complex and dynamic nature of budget allocation for defense operations and maintenance. It involves multiple factors and stakeholders, and is a critical aspect of the U.S. budget process.
