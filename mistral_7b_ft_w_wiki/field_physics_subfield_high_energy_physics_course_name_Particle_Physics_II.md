### Subsection: 1.1a Discoveries of the J/psi Meson

The J/psi meson, also known as the J-particle, is a subatomic particle that was first discovered in 1974 by physicists Burton Richter and Samuel Ting. The discovery of the J/psi meson was a significant breakthrough in particle physics, as it provided evidence for the existence of a new type of particle known as the charm quark.

The J/psi meson is a vector meson, meaning it has spin 1. It is composed of a charm quark and an anticharm quark, making it a charmonium particle. The discovery of the J/psi meson was made at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in California, using the SPEAR accelerator. The J/psi meson was observed in the decay of a higher-energy particle, known as the ψ(2S), which was also discovered by Richter and Ting.

The discovery of the J/psi meson was a major milestone in particle physics, as it provided evidence for the existence of the charm quark.

### Section: 1.2 Gluons:

Gluons are fundamental particles that play a crucial role in the strong nuclear force, which holds the nuclei of atoms together. They are the force carriers of the strong force, similar to how photons are the force carriers of the electromagnetic force. In this section, we will explore the properties and interactions of gluons, and their role in the fundamental building blocks of matter.

#### 1.2a Particle-antiparticle

In quantum mechanics, every particle has an antiparticle, which is its own antiparticle. This means that the antiparticle of a particle has the same mass and spin, but opposite charge. For example, the antiparticle of an electron is a positron, which has the same mass and spin as an electron, but positive charge instead of negative.

The concept of particle-antiparticle was first introduced by Paul Dirac in his theory of holes. In this theory, Dirac proposed that the negative energy states of the Dirac equation could be interpreted as antiparticles. This theory was later developed by Wolfgang Pauli and Werner Heisenberg, who introduced the concept of antiparticles as particles with opposite charge to the original particles.

The existence of antiparticles was first confirmed in the 1930s, when Carl Anderson discovered the positron in cosmic ray experiments. Since then, many other antiparticles have been discovered, including the antiproton and the antineutron.

In particle physics, antiparticles are often referred to as "antimatter" due to their opposite charge. However, it is important to note that antimatter is not the opposite of matter, but rather a different state of matter. Both matter and antimatter are made up of the same fundamental particles, but with opposite charges.

The study of particle-antiparticle interactions is a crucial aspect of particle physics. These interactions are responsible for the formation and decay of particles, and play a key role in the fundamental building blocks of matter. In the next section, we will explore the properties and interactions of gluons, which are responsible for the strong nuclear force between particles.





### Subsection: 1.2b Gluons inside Nucleons

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of particle-antiparticle and its importance in particle physics. In this section, we will focus on the role of gluons in the fundamental building blocks of matter, specifically inside nucleons.

Nucleons, which include protons and neutrons, are the building blocks of atomic nuclei. They are composed of three quarks, which are held together by the strong nuclear force. This force is mediated by gluons, which are the force carriers of the strong force.

The strong force between quarks is described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which is the theory of the strong force. QCD is based on the principles of quantum mechanics and special relativity, and it has been extensively tested and confirmed by experimental evidence.

One of the key predictions of QCD is the existence of gluons. These particles have not yet been definitively observed experimentally, but they are crucial for understanding the behavior of nucleons. Gluons are responsible for the strong force between quarks, which holds the nucleons together.

In addition to their role in the strong force, gluons also play a crucial role in the structure of nucleons. They are responsible for the spin of nucleons, which is a fundamental property of particles. The spin of a nucleon is determined by the spin of its quarks and the spin of the gluons between them.

The study of gluons inside nucleons is a crucial aspect of particle physics. It allows us to understand the fundamental building blocks of matter and the forces that hold them together. In the next section, we will explore the concept of quark confinement, which is another important aspect of QCD.

### Section 1.3: Dirac Formalism:

The Dirac formalism is a mathematical framework used in particle physics to describe the behavior of spin-1/2 particles, such as electrons. It was developed by British physicist Paul Dirac in the 1920s and has been instrumental in our understanding of the fundamental building blocks of matter.

#### 1.3a Chirality

Chirality is a fundamental concept in the Dirac formalism. It refers to the property of an object or system that is distinguishable from its mirror image. In other words, it is the difference between left-handed and right-handed objects. This concept is crucial in understanding the behavior of particles, as it affects their interactions with other particles and forces.

The term "chirality" was first used by Lord Kelvin in 1893, and it is derived from the Greek word "kheir," meaning "hand." This is because the human hand is a common example of chirality, as our left and right hands are non-superimposable mirror images of each other.

In the Dirac formalism, chirality is represented by the Dirac gamma matrices, which are a set of four 4x4 matrices that describe the spin and momentum of a particle. These matrices have a chiral property, meaning that they can be divided into two sets of matrices, one for left-handed particles and one for right-handed particles. This division is based on the concept of chirality, as left-handed particles have a different set of gamma matrices than right-handed particles.

The importance of chirality in the Dirac formalism lies in its role in the Dirac equation, which describes the behavior of spin-1/2 particles. The Dirac equation is a relativistic wave equation that takes into account the spin of the particle. It is a fundamental equation in particle physics and has been used to make predictions about the behavior of particles, such as the existence of antiparticles.

In addition to its role in the Dirac equation, chirality also plays a crucial role in the concept of parity. Parity is a symmetry property that describes the behavior of particles under a reflection. In the Dirac formalism, particles are classified as either parity-even or parity-odd, depending on their chirality. This classification is important in understanding the behavior of particles and their interactions with other particles.

Overall, chirality is a fundamental concept in the Dirac formalism and has been instrumental in our understanding of the fundamental building blocks of matter. Its role in the Dirac equation and parity classification has led to many important discoveries and predictions in particle physics.

### Section 1.3b Helicity

Helicity is another important concept in the Dirac formalism. It is closely related to chirality and is often used interchangeably with the term "spin." However, there are some key differences between the two concepts.

Helicity refers to the intrinsic angular momentum of a particle, while chirality refers to the spatial orientation of a particle. In other words, helicity describes the spin of a particle, while chirality describes the handedness of a particle.

The concept of helicity was first introduced by physicist George Uhlenbeck and mathematician Samuel Goudsmit in 1925. They proposed that electrons have an intrinsic angular momentum, or spin, that is independent of their orbital angular momentum. This concept was later incorporated into the Dirac formalism by Paul Dirac.

In the Dirac formalism, helicity is represented by the helicity operator, denoted by $\hat{\Lambda}$. This operator acts on the spinor wave function of a particle and gives the helicity of the particle. The helicity operator is defined as:

$$
\hat{\Lambda} = \frac{1}{2} \gamma^5
$$

where $\gamma^5$ is one of the Dirac gamma matrices.

Similar to chirality, helicity also plays a crucial role in the Dirac equation. The Dirac equation can be written in terms of the helicity operator, and it describes the behavior of spin-1/2 particles with different helicities. This is important because it allows us to understand the behavior of particles with different spin orientations.

In addition to its role in the Dirac equation, helicity also has implications for the behavior of particles in the presence of external forces. For example, in the presence of an electromagnetic field, particles with different helicities will experience different forces. This is known as the Zitterbewegung effect, and it is a key concept in the study of particle interactions.

In conclusion, helicity is a fundamental concept in the Dirac formalism that describes the spin of particles. It is closely related to chirality and plays a crucial role in the behavior of particles in the presence of external forces. Understanding helicity is essential for a comprehensive understanding of particle physics.





### Subsection 1.3c Why Higgs?

The Higgs boson, named after physicist Peter Higgs, is a fundamental particle that plays a crucial role in the Standard Model of particle physics. It is responsible for giving mass to other particles, and its discovery was a major breakthrough in the field of particle physics.

The Higgs boson was first proposed by physicist Yoichiro Nambu in 1960 as a way to explain the phenomenon of particle mass. Nambu proposed that there exists a scalar field, now known as the Higgs field, that permeates all of space and time. This field is responsible for giving mass to particles as they interact with it.

In 1964, Higgs and his colleagues proposed a more detailed theory, known as the Higgs mechanism, which explained how the Higgs field gives mass to particles. This theory was later incorporated into the Standard Model of particle physics, which is the current theory of particle physics.

The discovery of the Higgs boson was a major goal of particle physicists for decades. It was finally confirmed in 2012 by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These experiments observed a new particle with a mass of 125 GeV/c^2, which is consistent with the predicted mass of the Higgs boson.

The Higgs boson is unique in that it is the only particle in the Standard Model that has not yet been observed. This is because it is a scalar particle, which means it does not have spin and is therefore difficult to detect. However, its existence is crucial for the stability of the universe, as it is responsible for giving mass to other particles.

The discovery of the Higgs boson has opened up new avenues for research in particle physics. It has also led to the development of new theories, such as the Higgs portal, which attempts to explain the interaction between the Higgs boson and dark matter.

In conclusion, the Higgs boson is a fundamental particle that plays a crucial role in the Standard Model of particle physics. Its discovery has been a major breakthrough in the field of particle physics and has opened up new possibilities for research.

### Subsection 1.4a Solutions of the Dirac Equation

The Dirac equation is a relativistic wave equation that describes particles of spin-1/2, such as electrons. It is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics and has been instrumental in the development of modern particle physics. In this section, we will explore the solutions of the Dirac equation and their significance in understanding the behavior of particles.

#### 1.4a Solutions of the Dirac Equation

The Dirac equation is given by:

$$
(-i \vec{\alpha} \cdot \vec{\nabla} + \beta m) \psi = 0
$$

where $\vec{\alpha}$ and $\beta$ are matrices that depend on the Dirac gamma matrices, and $\psi$ is the wave function of the particle. The equation is written in terms of the Dirac gamma matrices, which are 4x4 matrices that satisfy the Clifford algebra $Cℓ_{3,1}$.

The solutions to the Dirac equation are four-component spinors, which represent the spin state of the particle. These spinors are denoted as $u^{(s)}(\vec{p})$ and $v^{(s)}(\vec{p})$ for positive energy solutions, and $u^{(s)}(\vec{p})$ and $v^{(s)}(\vec{p})$ for negative energy solutions. Here, $s$ represents the spin state of the particle, and $\vec{p}$ is the momentum of the particle.

The four rest-frame spinors $u^{(s)}(\vec{0})$ and $v^{(s)}(\vec{0})$ indicate that there are four distinct, real, linearly independent solutions to the Dirac equation. This can be made clear by observing that, when written in momentum space, the Dirac equation has the form:

$$
({p\!\!\!/} - m)u^{(s)}(\vec{p}) = 0
$$

and

$$
({p\!\!\!/} + m)v^{(s)}(\vec{p}) = 0
$$

This follows because ${p\!\!\!/}{p\!\!\!/} = p^\mu p_\mu = m^2$ which in turn follows from the anti-commutation relations for the gamma matrices:

$$
\left\{\gamma^\mu, \gamma^\nu\right\} = 2\eta^{\mu\nu}
$$

with $\eta^{\mu\nu}$ the metric tensor in flat space (in curved space, the gamma matrices can be viewed as being a kind of vielbein, although this is beyond the scope of the current article). It is perhaps useful to note that the Dirac equation, written in the rest frame, takes the form:

$$
\left(\gamma^0 - 1\right)u^{(s)}(\vec{0}) = 0
$$

and

$$
\left(\gamma^0 + 1\right)v^{(s)}(\vec{0}) = 0
$$

so that the rest-frame spinors can correctly be interpreted as solutions to the Dirac equation. There are four equations here, not eight. Although 4-spinors are written as four complex numbers, thus suggesting 8 real variables, only four of them have dynamical independence; the other four have no significance and can always be parameterized away. That is, one could take each of the four vectors $u^{(s)}(\vec{0})$ and $v^{(s)}(\vec{0})$ and multiply each by a distinct global phase $e^{i\eta}$. This phase changes nothing; it can be interpreted as a kind of global gauge freedom. This is not to say that "phases don't matter", as of course they do; the Dirac equation must satisfy certain conditions, such as being Hermitian conjugate to itself. However, the global phase does not affect the physical interpretation of the solutions.

This global gauge freedom is a manifestation of the U(1) symmetry of the Dirac equation. This symmetry is responsible for the conservation of charge in quantum mechanics, and it is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics. The global gauge freedom also allows us to choose a convenient representation of the Dirac spinors, such as the Dirac representation or the Majorana representation.

In the next section, we will explore the physical interpretation of the solutions of the Dirac equation and their role in particle physics.





### Subsection 1.4b Matrix

In the previous section, we discussed the solutions of the Dirac equation and their significance in understanding the behavior of particles. In this section, we will explore the concept of matrices and their role in particle physics.

#### 1.4b Matrix

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Matrices are used in particle physics to represent and manipulate physical quantities. They are particularly useful in dealing with systems that have multiple components, such as the Dirac equation.

In the context of the Dirac equation, we can represent the wave function $\psi$ as a column vector, and the matrices $\vec{\alpha}$ and $\beta$ as 4x4 matrices. The Dirac equation can then be written in matrix form as:

$$
(-i \vec{\alpha} \cdot \vec{\nabla} + \beta m) \psi = 0
$$

This allows us to easily manipulate the equation and solve it for different physical quantities.

Matrices are also used in particle physics to represent physical quantities that have multiple components. For example, the spinor $u^{(s)}(\vec{p})$ can be represented as a 4x1 matrix, and the spinor $v^{(s)}(\vec{p})$ can be represented as a 4x1 matrix. This allows us to easily manipulate these spinors and calculate their properties.

In addition to representing physical quantities, matrices are also used in particle physics to perform transformations. For example, the local gauge transformation can be represented as a matrix transformation. This allows us to easily manipulate the transformation and apply it to different physical quantities.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of local gauge transformation and its role in particle physics.





#### 1.4c Decays, Cross Sections and Radiative Corrections

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of local gauge transformation and its role in particle physics. In this section, we will explore the concept of decays, cross sections, and radiative corrections, which are fundamental to understanding the behavior of particles.

##### Decays

Decays are a fundamental process in particle physics, where a particle transforms into another particle or particles. This process is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics and can be described by the Schrödinger equation. The decay of a particle can be represented as a transition from an initial state to a final state, with the probability of the decay being determined by the overlap of these two states.

The decay of a particle can also be described in terms of the Dirac equation, which describes the behavior of spin-1/2 particles. The Dirac equation can be used to calculate the probability of a particle decaying into a specific state, taking into account the spin and momentum of the particle.

##### Cross Sections

Cross sections are a measure of the probability of a particle interacting with another particle. They are defined as the ratio of the number of particles that interact to the number of particles that pass through a given area. Cross sections are an important tool in particle physics, as they allow us to determine the likelihood of a particle interacting with another particle.

The cross section for a particle interaction can be calculated using the Schrödinger equation, which describes the wave function of a particle. The cross section is proportional to the square of the absolute value of the wave function, which represents the probability of the particle interacting with another particle.

##### Radiative Corrections

Radiative corrections are a crucial aspect of particle physics, as they allow us to account for the effects of virtual particles on the behavior of physical systems. These corrections are necessary because the equations used to describe particle interactions, such as the Schrödinger equation, are based on the assumption that particles are point-like and do not have any internal structure.

Radiative corrections can be calculated using perturbation theory, which is a mathematical technique used to approximate the effects of virtual particles on physical systems. These corrections are essential for accurately predicting the behavior of particles and can be used to test the validity of theoretical models.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of renormalization, which is a mathematical technique used to account for radiative corrections in particle physics. We will also discuss the concept of the Standard Model, which is the current theory of particle physics that describes the fundamental building blocks and interactions of matter.
