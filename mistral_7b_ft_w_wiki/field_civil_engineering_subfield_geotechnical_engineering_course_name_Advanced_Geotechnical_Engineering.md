### Subsection: 1.2b Site Investigation Techniques

The techniques used in site investigations are diverse and depend on the specific objectives and scope of the investigation. These techniques can be broadly categorized into two types: non-intrusive and intrusive methods. Non-intrusive methods do not disturb the ground, while intrusive methods involve physical disturbance of the ground.

#### Non-Intrusive Methods

Non-intrusive methods are often used as a preliminary investigation to determine the need for more detailed intrusive investigations. These methods include:

- **Desk Studies**: These involve the review of existing data and information, such as maps, reports, and databases. Desk studies can provide a quick and cost-effective way to gather information about a site, but they are limited by the quality and availability of the data.

- **Geophysical Surveys**: These involve the use of instruments to measure physical properties of the ground, such as electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, and ground penetrating radar. Geophysical surveys can provide valuable information about the subsurface conditions, but they require interpretation and validation with other data.

- **Remote Sensing**: These involve the use of satellite or airborne sensors to collect data about a site from a distance. Remote sensing can provide a broad overview of a site, but it is limited by the resolution of the sensors and the complexity of the terrain.

#### Intrusive Methods

Intrusive methods involve physical disturbance of the ground and are typically used to confirm the results of non-intrusive methods or to collect more detailed information. These methods include:

- **Soil and Rock Sampling**: These involve the collection of soil or rock samples for laboratory testing. Soil and rock sampling can provide detailed information about the physical and chemical properties of the ground, but it is time-consuming and can be costly.

- **Groundwater Monitoring**: These involve the installation of monitoring wells to measure the level and quality of groundwater. Groundwater monitoring can provide important information about the hydrological conditions of a site, but it requires regular maintenance and monitoring.

- **Seismic Investigations**: These involve the use of seismic instruments to measure the response of the ground to vibrations. Seismic investigations can provide information about the strength and stiffness of the ground, but they require specialized equipment and expertise.

The choice of investigation techniques depends on the specific objectives and scope of the investigation, as well as the available resources. It is common to use a combination of non-intrusive and intrusive methods to gather a comprehensive understanding of a site.
