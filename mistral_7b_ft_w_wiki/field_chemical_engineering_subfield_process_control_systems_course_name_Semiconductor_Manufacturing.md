## Foreward

Welcome to "Semiconductor Manufacturing: A Comprehensive Guide". This book aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex and ever-evolving field of semiconductor manufacturing. As the world's leading technology companies continue to invest billions of dollars into research and development, the demand for skilled professionals in this field is expected to grow significantly. This book is designed to equip you with the knowledge and skills necessary to excel in this exciting and dynamic field.

The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) has been a crucial guide for the semiconductor industry for several decades. However, as of 2017, it has been replaced by the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS). This book will delve into the details of the IRDS, providing a comprehensive overview of the technology directions and time-lines up to about 15 years into the future.

The book will also explore the history of semiconductor manufacturing, tracing its roots back to the 1960s when the first integrated circuits were developed. It will delve into the various processes involved in semiconductor manufacturing, including photolithography, etching, metal deposition, and more. The book will also discuss the challenges faced by the industry, such as the need for specialized machines and equipment, and how these challenges are being addressed through the development of a technology roadmap.

This book is designed for advanced undergraduate students at MIT, but it will also be a valuable resource for anyone interested in the field of semiconductor manufacturing. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional in the field, this book will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the principles and processes involved in semiconductor manufacturing.

I hope this book will serve as a valuable resource for you as you embark on your journey in the field of semiconductor manufacturing. Let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of semiconductor manufacturing together.




### Introduction

Semiconductor manufacturing is a complex and highly specialized process that involves the creation of microchips and other electronic devices. These devices are used in a wide range of applications, from consumer electronics to medical equipment, and their production requires a deep understanding of materials science, physics, and engineering principles.

In this chapter, we will provide an overview of semiconductor manufacturing, starting with a brief history of semiconductors and their role in modern technology. We will then delve into the fundamental concepts and techniques used in semiconductor manufacturing, including crystal growth, wafer fabrication, and device fabrication. We will also discuss the various types of semiconductors and their properties, as well as the different types of devices that can be made from them.

Throughout this chapter, we will use mathematical expressions and equations to explain key concepts and principles. For example, we might use the equation `$y_j(n)$` to represent the output of a neuron in a neural network, or the equation `$$
\Delta w = ...
$$` to represent the change in weight in a learning algorithm. These equations will be rendered using the popular MathJax library, which allows for easy formatting and rendering of mathematical expressions.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the basics of semiconductor manufacturing, including the key processes and techniques involved, the different types of semiconductors and devices, and the role of mathematics in this field. This will provide a strong foundation for the more detailed discussions and explanations in the subsequent chapters.
