In this chapter, we will cover the basics of nonlinear optimization, including the different types of nonlinear optimization problems, the concept of convexity, and the methods for solving nonlinear optimization problems. We will also discuss the applications of nonlinear optimization in optimal control, such as in the design of control laws for nonlinear systems.

Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of nonlinear optimization and its role in optimal control.

### Section: 1.1 Unconstrained Nonlinear Optimization:

In this section, we will focus on unconstrained nonlinear optimization, which is a type of optimization problem where there are no constraints on the decision variables. This type of optimization problem can be represented mathematically as:

$$
\min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} f(x)
$$

where $f(x)$ is a nonlinear objective function and $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the vector of decision variables. The goal is to find the vector $x^*$ that minimizes the objective function.

#### 1.1a Introduction to Unconstrained Nonlinear Optimization

Unconstrained nonlinear optimization is a fundamental concept in optimal control theory. It is used to find the optimal control strategy for a system, given certain objectives and constraints. In this subsection, we will provide an overview of unconstrained nonlinear optimization and its applications in optimal control.

One of the main challenges in unconstrained nonlinear optimization is the complexity of the objective function. Unlike linear optimization, where the objective function is linear, the objective function in nonlinear optimization can take on various forms, such as polynomial, exponential, or trigonometric functions. This makes it difficult to find an analytical solution, and numerical methods must be used to find the optimal solution.

There are various numerical methods for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems, such as the gradient descent method, the Newton's method, and the BFGS algorithm. These methods use different approaches to find the optimal solution, and their effectiveness depends on the properties of the objective function.

In optimal control, unconstrained nonlinear optimization is used to design control laws for nonlinear systems. The control law is a function that maps the system's state to the control input, and it is designed to optimize a certain objective, such as minimizing the error between the desired and actual output. The optimal control law is found by solving an unconstrained nonlinear optimization problem, where the objective function is the error between the desired and actual output.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the different numerical methods for solving unconstrained nonlinear optimization problems and their applications in optimal control. We will also discuss the concept of convexity and its importance in nonlinear optimization.

## Variants

## Algorithm

The algorithm starts with an initial estimate of the optimal value, $\mathbf{x}_0$, and proceeds iteratively to refine that estimate with a sequence of better estimates $\mathbf{x}_1,\mathbf{x}_2,\ldots$. The derivatives of the function $g_k:=\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)$ are used as a key driver of the algorithm to identify the direction of steepest descent, and also to form an estimate of the Hessian matrix (second derivative) of $f(\mathbf{x})$.

L-BFGS shares many features with other quasi-Newton algorithms, but is very different in how the matrix-vector multiplication $d_k=-H_k g_k$ is carried out, where $d_k$ is the approximate Newton's direction, $g_k$ is the current gradient, and $H_k$ is the inverse of the Hessian matrix. There are multiple published approaches using a history of updates to form this direction vector. Here, we give a common approach, the so-called "two loop recursion."

We take as given $x_k$, the position at the `k`-th iteration, and $g_k\equiv\nabla f(x_k)$ where $f$ is the function being minimized, and all vectors are column vectors. We also assume that we have stored the last `m` updates of the form 

We define $\rho_k = \frac{1}{y^{\top}_k s_k}$, and $H^0_k$ will be the 'initial' approximate of the inverse Hessian that our estimate at iteration `k` begins with.

The algorithm is based on the BFGS recursion for the inverse Hessian as

For a fixed `k` we define a sequence of vectors $q_{k-m},\ldots,q_k$ as $q_k:=g_k$ and $q_i:=(I-\rho_i y_i s_i^\top)q_{i+1}$. Then a recursive algorithm for calculating $H_k$ is given by

$$
H_k = \left(I-\frac{1}{\rho_k}y_ks_k^\top\right)H_{k-1}\left(I-\frac{1}{\rho_k}y_ks_k^\top\right)+\frac{1}{\rho_k}s_ks_k^\top
$$

where $H_{k-1}$ is the inverse Hessian matrix at the previous iteration. This algorithm is known as the Limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS) algorithm.

## Chapter 1: Nonlinear Optimization:




### Section: 1.1c Applications of Unconstrained Nonlinear Optimization

Unconstrained nonlinear optimization has a wide range of applications in various fields, including engineering, economics, and machine learning. In this section, we will discuss some of the key applications of unconstrained nonlinear optimization.

#### 1.1c.1 Engineering Applications

In engineering, unconstrained nonlinear optimization is used in the design and optimization of complex systems. For example, in the design of a bridge, engineers need to optimize the shape and size of the bridge to withstand the maximum load while minimizing the cost. This is a nonlinear optimization problem because the relationship between the bridge's shape, size, and load capacity is nonlinear.

Another example is in the design of a control system for a robot. The control system needs to optimize the robot's movements to perform a specific task while minimizing the energy consumption. This is a nonlinear optimization problem because the relationship between the robot's movements, energy consumption, and task performance is nonlinear.

#### 1.1c.2 Economic Applications

In economics, unconstrained nonlinear optimization is used in portfolio optimization, production planning, and resource allocation. For example, in portfolio optimization, an investor needs to optimize the allocation of their investments among different assets to maximize their return while minimizing their risk. This is a nonlinear optimization problem because the relationship between the portfolio's allocation, return, and risk is nonlinear.

Another example is in production planning, where a company needs to optimize the production schedule to maximize their profit while minimizing their costs. This is a nonlinear optimization problem because the relationship between the production schedule, costs, and profit is nonlinear.

#### 1.1c.3 Machine Learning Applications

In machine learning, unconstrained nonlinear optimization is used in training neural networks and other machine learning models. For example, in training a neural network, the network needs to optimize its weights to minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output. This is a nonlinear optimization problem because the relationship between the network's weights, input, and output is nonlinear.

Another example is in training a support vector machine (SVM), where the SVM needs to optimize the hyperplane to maximize the margin between the positive and negative examples. This is a nonlinear optimization problem because the relationship between the hyperplane, positive and negative examples, and the margin is nonlinear.

In conclusion, unconstrained nonlinear optimization plays a crucial role in various fields, and its applications are vast and diverse. The ability to solve these problems efficiently and accurately is essential for engineers, economists, and machine learning practitioners.




### Section: 1.2 Line Search Methods:

Line search methods are a class of optimization algorithms that are used to find the minimum of a function by searching along a line. These methods are particularly useful for nonlinear optimization problems, where the objective function may not be differentiable or may have multiple local minima. In this section, we will introduce the concept of line search methods and discuss their applications in nonlinear optimization.

#### 1.2a Introduction to Line Search Methods

Line search methods are a type of first-order optimization algorithm that is used to find the minimum of a function by searching along a line. These methods are particularly useful for nonlinear optimization problems, where the objective function may not be differentiable or may have multiple local minima.

The basic idea behind line search methods is to start at an initial point $x_0$ and search along a line in the direction of the gradient of the objective function. The search is continued until a minimum is found or until a stopping criterion is met. The minimum found by the line search method is then used as the starting point for the next iteration.

One of the key advantages of line search methods is that they can handle nonlinear objective functions. This is because the search is only along a line, and the objective function is only evaluated at each step. This makes line search methods particularly useful for problems where the objective function is complex and difficult to differentiate.

However, line search methods also have some limitations. One of the main challenges is determining the direction of the search. In some cases, the gradient of the objective function may not be available, or it may not be a good indicator of the direction of the minimum. In these cases, other methods, such as trust region methods, may be more suitable.

Another challenge is the choice of the stopping criterion. In some cases, the line search may not converge to a minimum, or it may converge to a local minimum instead of the global minimum. In these cases, it may be necessary to use a different stopping criterion or to combine the line search with other optimization methods.

Despite these challenges, line search methods have been successfully applied to a wide range of problems since they were first published in 1993. They have been used in fields such as engineering, economics, and machine learning, and have proven to be a powerful tool for solving nonlinear optimization problems.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the key algorithms used in line search methods, including the Armijo rule, the Wolfe conditions, and the Barzilai-Borwein method. We will also discuss how these algorithms can be combined with other optimization methods to solve more complex problems.

#### 1.2b Properties of Line Search Methods

Line search methods have several important properties that make them a powerful tool for solving nonlinear optimization problems. These properties include convergence, efficiency, and robustness.

##### Convergence

One of the key properties of line search methods is their ability to converge to a minimum. The convergence of a line search method is typically determined by the choice of the stopping criterion. Common stopping criteria include reaching a maximum number of iterations, achieving a certain level of accuracy, or satisfying a certain condition on the gradient of the objective function.

The convergence of a line search method can be analyzed using techniques from real analysis, such as the mean value theorem and the Taylor series expansion. These techniques can provide insights into the rate of convergence and the behavior of the method near a minimum.

##### Efficiency

Another important property of line search methods is their efficiency. The efficiency of a line search method is determined by its complexity and its ability to handle large-scale problems.

The complexity of a line search method refers to the amount of computational effort required to solve a problem. This can be measured in terms of the number of function evaluations, the number of gradient evaluations, or the total amount of time required to solve the problem.

Line search methods are particularly efficient for large-scale problems, where the objective function is nonlinear and the problem has many local minima. This is because the search is only along a line, and the objective function is only evaluated at each step. This makes line search methods particularly useful for problems where the objective function is complex and difficult to differentiate.

##### Robustness

The robustness of a line search method refers to its ability to handle nonlinear objective functions and multiple local minima. This is a key advantage of line search methods, as they can handle these challenges without the need for a second-order Taylor series approximation.

However, the robustness of a line search method can also be a limitation. In some cases, the line search may not converge to a minimum, or it may converge to a local minimum instead of the global minimum. In these cases, it may be necessary to use a different stopping criterion or to combine the line search with other optimization methods.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the key algorithms used in line search methods, including the Armijo rule, the Wolfe conditions, and the Barzilai-Borwein method. We will also discuss how these algorithms can be combined with other optimization methods to solve more complex problems.

#### 1.2c Applications of Line Search Methods

Line search methods have a wide range of applications in nonlinear optimization. They are particularly useful in problems where the objective function is nonlinear and the problem has many local minima. In this section, we will discuss some of the key applications of line search methods.

##### Nonlinear Least Squares

One of the most common applications of line search methods is in nonlinear least squares. In this problem, the goal is to minimize the sum of the squares of the residuals, which are the differences between the observed and predicted values. This is a nonlinear optimization problem because the residuals depend on the parameters through a nonlinear function.

Line search methods are particularly well-suited to this problem because they can handle the nonlinear objective function and the multiple local minima that often arise in least squares problems. They can also be used to solve the problem when the Jacobian matrix of the residuals is not available, which is often the case in practice.

##### Nonlinear Constraint Optimization

Another important application of line search methods is in nonlinear constraint optimization. In this problem, the goal is to minimize a nonlinear objective function subject to a set of nonlinear constraints. This is a challenging problem because the constraints can create multiple local minima, and the objective function may not be differentiable at the constraints.

Line search methods can be used to solve this problem by performing a line search along the direction of the gradient of the objective function. The search is stopped when the gradient becomes zero or when a constraint is reached. This approach can be used even when the constraints are not explicitly available, making it a powerful tool for solving real-world optimization problems.

##### Nonlinear Programming

Line search methods are also widely used in nonlinear programming, which is the optimization of a nonlinear objective function subject to a set of linear constraints. This is a special case of nonlinear constraint optimization, where the constraints are linear.

In this application, line search methods are particularly useful because they can handle the nonlinear objective function and the multiple local minima that often arise in nonlinear programming problems. They can also be used to solve the problem when the Jacobian matrix of the constraints is not available, which is often the case in practice.

In conclusion, line search methods are a powerful tool for solving nonlinear optimization problems. Their ability to handle nonlinear objective functions, multiple local minima, and the lack of derivative information makes them a versatile and robust choice for a wide range of applications.

## Chapter: Chapter 2: Convexity and Conjugate Duality

### Introduction

In this chapter, we delve into the fascinating world of convexity and conjugate duality, two fundamental concepts in the field of optimal control theory. These concepts are not only essential for understanding the theory but also play a crucial role in the practical application of optimal control.

Convexity is a mathematical property that is central to many areas of optimization. A function is said to be convex if it satisfies certain conditions, such as being above all of its tangent lines. This property is particularly useful in optimization because it allows us to guarantee the existence of a global minimum. In the context of optimal control, convexity ensures that the optimal control is unique and can be easily computed.

On the other hand, conjugate duality is a powerful tool that allows us to transform a constrained optimization problem into an unconstrained one. This transformation is achieved by introducing a dual variable, which represents the sensitivity of the objective function to changes in the constraints. Conjugate duality is particularly useful in optimal control because it provides a systematic way to handle constraints, which are often present in real-world problems.

Throughout this chapter, we will explore these concepts in depth, starting with their basic definitions and properties, and then moving on to more advanced topics. We will also discuss their applications in optimal control, providing a comprehensive understanding of how these concepts are used in practice.

By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of convexity and conjugate duality, and be able to apply these concepts to solve a wide range of optimal control problems. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a practitioner in the field, this chapter will provide you with the knowledge and tools you need to navigate the complex landscape of optimal control.




### Section: 1.2 Line Search Methods:

Line search methods are a powerful tool for solving nonlinear optimization problems. In this section, we will discuss the basics of line search methods, including the different types of line search methods and their applications.

#### 1.2b Techniques of Line Search Methods

There are several techniques that can be used in line search methods, each with its own advantages and limitations. Some of the most commonly used techniques include the Armijo rule, the Wolfe conditions, and the Barzilai-Borwein method.

The Armijo rule, also known as the strong Wolfe conditions, is a popular technique for determining the direction of the search. It requires the objective function to be differentiable and convex, and it uses a line search to find the minimum along the direction of the gradient. The Armijo rule is particularly useful for problems with a single local minimum, as it guarantees convergence to the minimum.

The Wolfe conditions, on the other hand, are a set of conditions that can be used to determine the direction of the search. They are less strict than the Armijo rule, but they still ensure convergence to the minimum. The Wolfe conditions are particularly useful for problems with multiple local minima, as they allow for a more flexible search direction.

The Barzilai-Borwein method is a popular technique for determining the step size in line search methods. It uses a quadratic approximation of the objective function to determine the step size, and it has been shown to be effective for a wide range of problems. The Barzilai-Borwein method is particularly useful for problems with non-convex objective functions, as it can handle non-convexity without the need for additional constraints.

In addition to these techniques, there are also other methods that can be used in line search methods, such as the trust region method and the conjugate gradient method. These methods have their own advantages and limitations, and they can be used depending on the specific problem at hand.

Overall, line search methods are a powerful tool for solving nonlinear optimization problems. By using a combination of techniques, such as the Armijo rule, the Wolfe conditions, and the Barzilai-Borwein method, these methods can effectively find the minimum of a nonlinear objective function. In the next section, we will discuss the applications of line search methods in more detail.

Furthermore, we have seen how nonlinear optimization plays a crucial role in optimal control. By formulating the control problem as an optimization problem, we can find the optimal control inputs that minimize a cost function while satisfying certain constraints. This allows us to achieve the desired performance and stability in control systems.

In conclusion, nonlinear optimization is a fundamental concept in optimal control and has a wide range of applications. By understanding its principles and techniques, we can effectively solve complex optimization problems and design optimal control systems.

### Subsection: 1.2c Applications of Line Search Methods

Line search methods have a wide range of applications in nonlinear optimization. They are particularly useful for solving problems with non-convex objective functions, as they can handle non-convexity without the need for additional constraints. Some common applications of line search methods include:

- Optimization of machine learning models: Line search methods are commonly used to optimize the parameters of machine learning models, such as neural networks and decision trees.
