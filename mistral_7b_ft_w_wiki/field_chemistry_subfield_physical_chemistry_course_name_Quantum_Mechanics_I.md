### Subsection 1.2a Definition of Free Particle

In quantum mechanics, a free particle is a particle that is not subject to any external forces. This means that the particle is not influenced by any external potential energy, and its behavior is solely determined by its internal energy and momentum. In classical mechanics, a free particle is characterized by a constant velocity, while in quantum mechanics, it is described by a wave function that satisfies the Schrödinger equation.

The Schrödinger equation for a free particle is given by:

$$
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\psi(\mathbf{r},t) = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2\psi(\mathbf{r},t)
$$

where $\psi(\mathbf{r},t)$ is the wave function of the particle, $\mathbf{r}$ is the position vector, $t$ is time, $m$ is the mass of the particle, and $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant.

The solution to this equation is a plane wave of the form:

$$
\psi(\mathbf{r},t) = Ae^{i(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{r}-\omega t)} = Ae^{i(\mathbf{p}\cdot\mathbf{r} - E t)/\hbar}
$$

where $A$ is the amplitude, $\mathbf{k}$ is the wave vector, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency. The energy of the particle is given by $E = \hbar\omega$.

The wave vector $\mathbf{k}$ is related to the momentum $\mathbf{p}$ of the particle by the de Broglie relation:

$$
\mathbf{p} = \hbar\mathbf{k}
$$

This relation is a direct consequence of the wave-particle duality of matter, which is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics. It states that particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior, and the de Broglie relation is a manifestation of this duality.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of the wave-particle duality and its role in the behavior of free particles.

### Subsection: 1.3c Motion in Multiple Dimensions

In the previous sections, we have discussed the motion of particles in one dimension. However, in reality, particles move in multiple dimensions, and their motion is governed by more complex equations. In this section, we will explore the motion of particles in multiple dimensions and the equations that describe it.

#### 1.3c.1 Motion in Two Dimensions

In two dimensions, the motion of a particle can be described by two coordinates, typically denoted as x and y. The position of the particle can be represented as a point in a two-dimensional plane. The velocity of the particle is also a vector with two components, vx and vy, representing the rate of change of the x and y coordinates, respectively.

The equations of motion in two dimensions can be derived from Newton's second law, which states that the force acting on a particle is equal to the mass of the particle times its acceleration. In two dimensions, this law can be written as:

$$
F_x = ma_x = m\frac{dv_x}{dt}
$$

$$
F_y = ma_y = m\frac{dv_y}{dt}
$$

where Fx and Fy are the forces acting in the x and y directions, respectively, and ax and ay are the accelerations in those directions.

#### 1.3c.2 Motion in Three Dimensions

In three dimensions, the motion of a particle is described by three coordinates, typically denoted as x, y, and z. The position of the particle is represented as a point in a three-dimensional space. The velocity of the particle is also a vector with three components, vx, vy, and vz, representing the rate of change of the x, y, and z coordinates, respectively.

The equations of motion in three dimensions can be derived from Newton's second law, which can be written as:

$$
F_x = ma_x = m\frac{dv_x}{dt}
$$

$$
F_y = ma_y = m\frac{dv_y}{dt}
$$

$$
F_z = ma_z = m\frac{dv_z}{dt}
$$

where Fx, Fy, and Fz are the forces acting in the x, y, and z directions, respectively, and az is the acceleration in the z direction.

#### 1.3c.3 Motion in Higher Dimensions

In higher dimensions, the motion of a particle is described by more than three coordinates. The equations of motion can be generalized to include more components and forces acting in different directions. However, the principles remain the same, and the equations can be derived from Newton's second law.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of rotational motion and how it is described by the equations of motion.





### Subsection: 1.4a Concept of Infinite Box

In the previous sections, we have discussed the motion of particles in multiple dimensions. However, in reality, particles are confined to a finite space. In this section, we will explore the concept of an infinite box and how it affects the motion of particles.

#### 1.4a.1 Infinite Box

An infinite box is a theoretical construct that represents a space with no boundaries. In quantum mechanics, this concept is often used to model particles confined to a finite region of space. The infinite box is a useful model because it allows us to study the behavior of particles in a controlled environment without the complications of external forces or interactions.

The infinite box can be visualized as a three-dimensional cube with infinite dimensions in all directions. The particles within this box are free to move in any direction, but they are confined to the box itself. This means that the particles cannot escape the box, but they can move freely within it.

#### 1.4a.2 Particles in an Infinite Box

In an infinite box, the motion of particles is governed by the Schrödinger equation, which describes the wave-like nature of particles. The Schrödinger equation for a particle in an infinite box can be written as:

$$
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \hat{H}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)
$$

where $\Psi(\mathbf{r},t)$ is the wave function of the particle, $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, and $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant.

The Hamiltonian operator for a particle in an infinite box is given by:

$$
\hat{H} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2
$$

where $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator.

#### 1.4a.3 Solutions to the Schrödinger Equation

The Schrödinger equation for a particle in an infinite box has a number of solutions, each corresponding to a different energy level of the particle. These solutions are given by the wave functions:

$$
\Psi_n(\mathbf{r},t) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}}\sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)e^{-iE_nt/\hbar}
$$

where $L$ is the length of the box, $n$ is a positive integer, and $E_n = \frac{n^2\pi^2\hbar^2}{2mL^2}$ is the energy of the particle at the $n$th energy level.

These wave functions represent standing waves within the box, with the particles at the $n$th energy level having a de Broglie wavelength of $\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2mE_n}}$.

#### 1.4a.4 Quantum Confinement

The concept of an infinite box is particularly useful in understanding the phenomenon of quantum confinement. Quantum confinement occurs when particles are confined to a space that is smaller than their de Broglie wavelength. In this case, the particles behave more like waves than particles, and their energy levels become quantized.

In an infinite box, the particles are always confined, and their energy levels are always quantized. This is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics and is one of the key differences between classical and quantum mechanics.

#### 1.4a.5 Applications of the Infinite Box

The concept of an infinite box has many applications in quantum mechanics. It is used to model particles in a variety of physical systems, including atoms, molecules, and nanostructures. It is also used in the study of quantum statistics, where it helps to explain the behavior of particles in a system.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of the infinite box in more detail and discuss its implications for the behavior of particles in quantum systems.
