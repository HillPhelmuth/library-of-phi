### Introduction

Welcome to the first chapter of "Introduction to Observational Physical Oceanography"! In this book, we will explore the fascinating world of physical oceanography, focusing on the observational aspects of this field. As we delve into the physical properties of sea water, we will gain a deeper understanding of the ocean and its role in shaping our planet.

Physical oceanography is a multidisciplinary field that combines principles from physics, mathematics, and geology to study the physical properties of the ocean. It is a crucial field of study, as the ocean plays a vital role in regulating Earth's climate, transporting heat and nutrients, and supporting marine life.

In this chapter, we will focus on some of the fundamental physical properties of sea water. We will explore the composition of sea water, its density, and its role in ocean circulation. We will also discuss the effects of temperature and salinity on these properties, and how they can impact the ocean's behavior.

As we journey through the physical properties of sea water, we will also touch upon the various methods and technologies used to observe and measure these properties. From traditional methods such as water sampling and temperature measurements, to modern technologies like satellite imaging and remote sensing, we will see how these tools have revolutionized our understanding of the ocean.

So, let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of physical oceanography!




### Section: 1.1 Salinity:

Salinity is a fundamental physical property of sea water that plays a crucial role in shaping the ocean's behavior. It is defined as the total amount of dissolved salts in a body of water, usually expressed in parts per thousand (ppt) or grams per kilogram (g/kg). The salinity of sea water is typically around 35 ppt, but it can vary depending on factors such as evaporation, precipitation, and freshwater input from rivers.

#### 1.1a Definition of Salinity

The definition of salinity is conceptually simple, but technically challenging to measure precisely. Conceptually, salinity is the quantity of dissolved salt content of the water. Salts are compounds like sodium chloride, magnesium sulfate, potassium nitrate, and sodium bicarbonate which dissolve into ions. The concentration of dissolved chloride ions is sometimes referred to as chlorinity.

Operationally, dissolved matter is defined as that which can pass through a very fine filter (historically a filter with a pore size of 0.45 μm, but nowadays usually 0.2 μm). Salinity can be expressed in the form of a mass fraction, i.e. the mass of the dissolved material in a unit mass of solution.

The salinity of seawater typically has a mass salinity of around 35 g/kg, although lower values are typical near coasts where rivers enter the ocean. Rivers and lakes can have a wide range of salinities, from less than 0.01 g/kg to a few g/kg, although there are many places where higher salinities are found. The Dead Sea has a salinity of more than 200 g/kg. Precipitation typically has a TDS of 20 mg/kg or less.

Whatever pore size is used in the definition, the resulting salinity value of a given sample of natural water will not vary by more than a few percent. This is because the salinity is primarily determined by the concentration of dissolved ions, which are relatively uniform throughout the ocean. However, local variations can occur due to factors such as freshwater input from rivers, evaporation, and precipitation.

In the next section, we will explore the physical properties of sea water and how salinity affects them. We will also discuss the methods and technologies used to measure salinity in the ocean.

#### 1.1b Measurement of Salinity

The measurement of salinity in sea water is a crucial aspect of physical oceanography. It allows us to understand the ocean's circulation patterns, heat transfer, and the distribution of marine life. There are several methods for measuring salinity, each with its own advantages and limitations.

##### Traditional Methods

Traditional methods for measuring salinity include the use of a salinometer, a device that measures the electrical conductivity of a water sample. The salinity is then calculated based on a predetermined relationship between conductivity and salinity. This method is accurate and reliable, but it can be time-consuming and requires a laboratory setting.

Another traditional method is the use of a titration curve, which involves adding a strong acid to a water sample until the pH reaches a certain endpoint. The amount of acid required is then used to calculate the salinity. This method is less accurate than the salinometer, but it can be performed in the field.

##### Modern Methods

Modern methods for measuring salinity include the use of a CTD (conductivity, temperature, and depth) sensor, which measures the electrical conductivity of the water as it is being collected. This allows for real-time measurements of salinity, temperature, and depth. CTD sensors are accurate and reliable, and they can be used in a variety of ocean environments.

Another modern method is the use of satellite imaging, which can provide large-scale measurements of sea surface salinity. This method is non-invasive and can cover large areas, but it is less accurate than in-situ measurements.

##### Salinity Profiles

A salinity profile is a vertical section of the water column, showing how salinity changes with depth. This is important because salinity can vary significantly with depth, especially in areas of strong vertical mixing. Salinity profiles can be obtained using a CTD sensor or by collecting water samples at different depths and measuring their salinity.

In the next section, we will explore the physical properties of sea water and how salinity affects them. We will also discuss the role of salinity in ocean circulation and its impact on marine life.

#### 1.1c Salinity and Ocean Circulation

Salinity plays a crucial role in ocean circulation, influencing the density of seawater and thus its ability to move. The relationship between salinity and density is governed by the equation of state for seawater, which describes how the properties of seawater (such as density, sound speed, and potential temperature) change with pressure and temperature.

##### Density and Salinity

The density of seawater is primarily determined by its salinity, temperature, and pressure. Salinity is the most significant factor, with higher salinity resulting in higher density. This is because the ions in seawater increase its mass and decrease its volume, making it denser.

The relationship between salinity and density is described by the equation of state for seawater, which can be expressed as:

$$
\rho = \rho_0 \left( 1 - \alpha_T (T - T_0) + \alpha_S (S - S_0) \right) \left( 1 - \beta_T (T - T_0) + \beta_S (S - S_0) \right) \left( 1 - \gamma_T (T - T_0) + \gamma_S (S - S_0) \right)

$$

where $\rho$ is the density, $\rho_0$ is the reference density, $\alpha_T$ and $\alpha_S$ are the thermal and haline (salinity-related) expansivity coefficients, $T$ and $S$ are the temperature and salinity, and $\beta_T$ and $\beta_S$ are the thermal and haline contraction coefficients, and $\gamma_T$ and $\gamma_S$ are the thermal and haline compressibility coefficients.

##### Salinity and Ocean Currents

The relationship between salinity and density is crucial for ocean currents. Differences in density drive the movement of water, with denser water sinking and less dense water rising. This is known as the density-driven circulation.

In the ocean, salinity can vary significantly due to factors such as evaporation, precipitation, and freshwater input from rivers. These variations can create differences in density, leading to the formation of ocean currents. For example, in the Mediterranean Sea, the salinity is higher in the eastern basin due to evaporation, leading to a denser water column and a net transport of water from the eastern to the western basin.

##### Salinity and Marine Life

Salinity also plays a crucial role in the distribution and survival of marine life. Many marine organisms are sensitive to changes in salinity, and variations in salinity can have significant impacts on their populations. For example, the sessile organism "Ciona intestinalis" has been shown to be sensitive to changes in salinity, with a decrease in salinity leading to a decrease in its population.

In conclusion, salinity is a fundamental physical property of sea water that influences ocean circulation, density, and marine life. Understanding its role in these processes is crucial for studying and managing the ocean.




### Section: 1.1b Measurement of Salinity

The measurement of salinity is a critical aspect of physical oceanography. It allows us to understand the ocean's circulation patterns, heat transfer, and the distribution of marine life. The salinity of seawater is typically measured using a conductivity sensor, which measures the electrical conductivity of the water. The more salts dissolved in the water, the higher the conductivity.

#### 1.1b.1 Conductivity Sensors

Conductivity sensors are the most common method for measuring salinity. They work by passing an alternating voltage between two electrodes immersed in the water. The salts in the water act as a conductor, allowing the voltage to travel between the electrodes. The speed at which the voltage travels is directly proportional to the salinity of the water.

The conductivity sensor is typically part of a CTD (conductivity, temperature, and depth) instrument, which measures these three parameters simultaneously. The CTD is lowered into the water column, and the conductivity sensor measures the salinity at different depths. This allows us to create a vertical profile of salinity, which can reveal important information about the ocean's circulation patterns.

#### 1.1b.2 Other Methods of Salinity Measurement

While conductivity sensors are the most common method for measuring salinity, there are other methods that can be used. These include titration methods, which involve adding a known amount of a titrant to a sample of seawater until the reaction is complete. The amount of titrant used is then used to calculate the salinity.

Another method is the use of optical sensors, which measure the light absorption or scattering of the water. This can provide information about the concentration of particles in the water, which can be used to estimate the salinity.

#### 1.1b.3 Salinity Scales

The salinity of seawater is typically expressed in parts per thousand (ppt) or grams per kilogram (g/kg). However, there are different scales used to express salinity, each with its own advantages and limitations.

The Knudsen salinity scale, named after Danish oceanographer Carl Emil Bech-Knudsen, is based on the chlorinity of seawater. The chlorinity is determined by titration with silver nitrate, and the resulting salinity is calculated using a factor. This scale is still used in some regions, but it has been largely replaced by the practical salinity scale (PSS).

The practical salinity scale (PSS) is based on the electrical conductivity of seawater. It does not have units, but the suffix psu (practical salinity unit) is sometimes added. The PSS is widely used and is the basis for the modern salinity scales.

The absolute salinity scale, introduced in 2010 as part of the thermodynamic equation of seawater (TEOS-10), is based on the mass fraction of salts in the water. It takes into account regional variations in the composition of seawater, and it is calculated using a combination of electrical conductivity measurements and other information.

In conclusion, the measurement of salinity is a crucial aspect of physical oceanography. It allows us to understand the ocean's circulation patterns, heat transfer, and the distribution of marine life. While conductivity sensors are the most common method for measuring salinity, there are other methods and scales that can be used.




### Subsection: 1.1c Factors Affecting Salinity

Salinity is a critical physical property of seawater that is influenced by a variety of factors. These factors can be broadly categorized into two groups: physical factors and biological factors.

#### 1.1c.1 Physical Factors

Physical factors that affect salinity include evaporation, precipitation, and river runoff. Evaporation is the primary mechanism for increasing salinity in the ocean. As water evaporates, the salts dissolved in it are left behind, increasing the salinity of the remaining water. Precipitation, on the other hand, can decrease salinity by washing salts out of the water. River runoff also plays a role in salinity, as rivers carry freshwater from the land to the ocean, diluting the salinity of the seawater.

#### 1.1c.2 Biological Factors

Biological factors that affect salinity include the growth and death of marine organisms. Marine organisms, such as phytoplankton and other microscopic organisms, play a crucial role in the ocean's biogeochemical cycles. As these organisms grow, they absorb nutrients from the water, including salts. When these organisms die, they sink to the ocean floor, carrying these nutrients, including salts, with them. This process can increase the salinity of the water.

#### 1.1c.3 Human Activities

Human activities, such as irrigation and deforestation, can also affect salinity. Irrigation can increase river runoff, diluting the salinity of the seawater. Deforestation, on the other hand, can decrease river runoff, leading to increased evaporation and therefore increased salinity.

#### 1.1c.4 Climate Change

Climate change is expected to have a significant impact on salinity in the future. As mentioned in the previous section, climate change could potentially ameliorate salinity in Australia in some circumstances, but in others it may have detrimental effects. For instance, a reduction in annual rainfall could lead to a drier and warmer climate, reducing salinity. However, climate change is also expected to result in more extreme weather events, such as larger down pours, which could increase salinity by reducing the chance of the water table transporting underground salts to the surface of the land.

In conclusion, salinity is a complex physical property of seawater that is influenced by a variety of factors. Understanding these factors is crucial for predicting changes in salinity and their potential impacts on marine ecosystems.




### Subsection: 1.2a Temperature Distribution in the Ocean

The temperature distribution in the ocean is a complex and dynamic system, influenced by a variety of factors including solar radiation, wind patterns, and ocean currents. In this section, we will explore the vertical distribution of temperature in the ocean, focusing on the thermocline and its role in regulating ocean temperature.

#### 1.2a.1 The Thermocline

The thermocline is a layer in the ocean where there is a rapid change in temperature with depth. This layer is typically found at depths between 100 and 1000 meters, and is characterized by a sharp increase in temperature with depth. The thermocline plays a crucial role in regulating the temperature of the ocean, as it acts as a barrier between the warmer surface waters and the colder deep waters.

The thermocline is primarily driven by solar radiation. During the day, the sun heats the surface of the ocean, causing the water to warm. As the water warms, it becomes less dense and rises to the surface. This process is known as convection. At night, the surface waters cool down, becoming denser and sinking back down to the bottom of the thermocline. This process is known as advection.

#### 1.2a.2 Factors Affecting the Thermocline

The depth of the thermocline can vary depending on a variety of factors. One of the main factors is the amount of solar radiation received at the surface of the ocean. Areas near the equator receive more solar radiation than areas near the poles, resulting in a deeper thermocline near the equator.

Wind patterns also play a role in the depth of the thermocline. Wind can mix the surface waters, reducing the temperature gradient and shallowing the thermocline. This is particularly true in the tropics, where strong trade winds can create a shallow thermocline.

Ocean currents can also affect the depth of the thermocline. For example, the Gulf Stream, a warm ocean current that flows along the eastern coast of the United States, can deepen the thermocline in the North Atlantic.

#### 1.2a.3 The Role of the Thermocline in Ocean Heat Content

The thermocline plays a crucial role in regulating the ocean's heat content. As mentioned in the previous section, the upper ocean (0-700 meters) has warmed since 1971, while it is very likely that warming has occurred at intermediate depths (700-2000 meters) and likely that deep ocean (below 2000 meters) temperatures have increased.

The thermocline acts as a barrier between the warmer surface waters and the colder deep waters. As the surface waters warm, they can only warm the deep waters by passing through the thermocline. This process is known as vertical mixing. The deeper the thermocline, the more difficult it is for warm surface waters to mix with cold deep waters, resulting in a slower increase in ocean heat content.

In conclusion, the thermocline plays a crucial role in regulating the temperature of the ocean. Its depth is influenced by a variety of factors, including solar radiation, wind patterns, and ocean currents. Understanding the thermocline is essential for understanding the complex dynamics of ocean temperature and its role in climate change.




### Subsection: 1.2b Factors Affecting Ocean Temperature

The temperature of the ocean is influenced by a variety of factors, including solar radiation, wind patterns, and ocean currents. In this section, we will explore these factors in more detail and discuss their impact on ocean temperature.

#### 1.2b.1 Solar Radiation

Solar radiation is the primary driver of ocean temperature. The amount of solar radiation received at the surface of the ocean is directly related to the temperature of the water. Areas near the equator receive more solar radiation than areas near the poles, resulting in warmer ocean temperatures near the equator.

The amount of solar radiation received at the surface of the ocean is also affected by cloud cover. Clouds can block some of the incoming solar radiation, reducing the amount of heat reaching the surface of the ocean. This can lead to cooler ocean temperatures in areas with high cloud cover.

#### 1.2b.2 Wind Patterns

Wind patterns can also have a significant impact on ocean temperature. Wind can mix the surface waters, reducing the temperature gradient and shallowing the thermocline. This is particularly true in the tropics, where strong trade winds can create a shallow thermocline.

In addition, wind can also drive ocean currents, which can transport warm or cold water to different areas of the ocean. For example, the trade winds in the tropics can drive the formation of the Gulf Stream, a warm ocean current that flows along the eastern coast of the United States.

#### 1.2b.3 Ocean Currents

Ocean currents play a crucial role in regulating ocean temperature. As mentioned earlier, the Gulf Stream is a warm ocean current that can transport warm water to the North Atlantic. This can have a significant impact on the temperature of the North Atlantic, as demonstrated by the MOC Observations study mentioned in the related context.

Ocean currents can also transport cold water from the deep ocean to the surface, leading to cooler ocean temperatures. This is particularly true in the Southern Ocean, where deep convection can bring cold water to the surface.

#### 1.2b.4 Climate Variability

Climate variability, such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Southern Annular Mode (SAM), can also have a significant impact on ocean temperature. These climate phenomena can cause changes in wind patterns and ocean currents, leading to variations in ocean temperature.

For example, McKee et al. conducted a study of the variability of bottom water temperature relative to ENSO, SAM, and Antarctic Dipole (ADP). Their research suggests that there needs to be large ENSO and SAM events to impact the WSBW, which can have a significant impact on global climate.

In conclusion, the temperature of the ocean is influenced by a variety of factors, including solar radiation, wind patterns, and ocean currents. These factors can interact in complex ways, making it challenging to predict changes in ocean temperature. However, by studying these factors and their interactions, we can gain a better understanding of the physical properties of sea water and its role in regulating global climate.





### Subsection: 1.2c Measurement of Ocean Temperature

The measurement of ocean temperature is a crucial aspect of physical oceanography. It allows us to understand the dynamics of the ocean and its impact on global climate. In this section, we will explore the various methods used to measure ocean temperature.

#### 1.2c.1 Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth (CTD)

The Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth (CTD) system is a state-of-the-art technology used for measuring temperature and other parameters electronically. It is a crucial tool for physical oceanographers, as it allows for the continuous monitoring of temperature and other parameters at different depths.

The CTD system consists of a frame that includes water sampling bottles and a device that measures conductivity, temperature, and depth. The device continuously sends the data up to the ship via a conducting cable. This system is particularly useful for obtaining accurate and precise temperature measurements at different depths.

#### 1.2c.2 Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs)

Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are another important tool for measuring ocean temperature. These vehicles are equipped with CTD sensors and can operate independently of a research ship. They can collect data at different depths and transmit it back to the research team via telemetry.

AUVs are particularly useful for long-term monitoring of ocean temperature. They can be programmed to collect data at specific locations and at regular intervals, providing a comprehensive and continuous record of ocean temperature.

#### 1.2c.3 Sea Surface Temperature (SST)

Sea surface temperature (SST) is another important parameter in physical oceanography. It is typically measured using a combination of satellite and in-situ measurements.

Satellite measurements of SST are obtained using microwave sensors, which can penetrate through clouds and measure the temperature of the ocean surface. These measurements are particularly useful for large-scale studies of ocean temperature.

In-situ measurements of SST are typically obtained using a variety of techniques, including traditional methods such as the use of thermometers and more modern methods such as the use of spectroscopy. These measurements are crucial for understanding the dynamics of the ocean surface and its impact on global climate.

#### 1.2c.4 Ocean Acoustic Tomography

Ocean Acoustic Tomography (OAT) is a relatively new technique for measuring ocean temperature. It uses sound waves to penetrate the ocean and measure the temperature at different depths. This technique is particularly useful for obtaining high-resolution temperature profiles.

OAT is a non-invasive technique, making it ideal for long-term monitoring of ocean temperature. It can also be used to study the dynamics of the ocean, including the movement of ocean currents and the mixing of different water masses.

In conclusion, the measurement of ocean temperature is a crucial aspect of physical oceanography. It allows us to understand the dynamics of the ocean and its impact on global climate. The various methods used to measure ocean temperature, including CTD systems, AUVs, satellite measurements, and OAT, provide a comprehensive and continuous record of ocean temperature.
