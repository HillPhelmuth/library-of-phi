### Introduction

The study of solids is a fundamental aspect of physics, with applications ranging from materials science to condensed matter physics. In this chapter, we will introduce the free electron model, a simplified model used to describe the behavior of electrons in a solid. This model is based on the assumption that the electrons in a solid are free to move and are not influenced by the surrounding atoms. While this may seem like a drastic simplification, the free electron model has been successful in explaining many properties of solids, such as electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity.

We will begin by discussing the basic concepts of the free electron model, including the concept of a Fermi surface and the Fermi-Dirac distribution. We will then explore the implications of this model for different types of solids, including metals and insulators. We will also discuss the limitations of the free electron model and how it can be extended to more complex systems.

Throughout this chapter, we will use mathematical equations to describe the behavior of electrons in a solid. These equations will be formatted using the popular Markdown format, with math expressions rendered using the MathJax library. For example, we will write inline math like `$y_j(n)$` and equations like `$$
\Delta w = ...
$$`. This will allow us to present complex mathematical concepts in a clear and concise manner.

### Section 1.1 Crystalline Lattice:

In the previous chapter, we discussed the concept of a crystal structure and its importance in determining the physical properties of a solid. In this section, we will delve deeper into the structure of a crystal and explore the concept of a crystalline lattice.

#### 1.1a Definition of a Crystal Structure

A crystal structure is a description of the ordered arrangement of atoms, ions, or molecules in a crystalline material. This ordered arrangement is a result of the intrinsic nature of the constituent particles to form symmetric patterns that repeat along the principal directions of three-dimensional space in matter. The smallest group of particles in the material that constitutes this repeating pattern is known as the unit cell.

The unit cell is defined as the smallest repeating unit that has the full symmetry of the crystal structure. The geometry of the unit cell is described as a parallelepiped, providing six lattice parameters taken as the lengths of the cell edges ("a", "b", "c") and the angles between them (α, β, γ). The positions of particles inside the unit cell are described by the fractional coordinates ("x<sub>i</sub>", "y<sub>i</sub>", "z<sub>i</sub>") along the cell edges, measured from a reference point.

The concept of a unit cell is crucial in understanding the symmetry of a crystal structure. The symmetry of a crystal is described by the concept of space groups, which are a set of 230 possible symmetric arrangements of particles in three-dimensional space. These space groups are classified based on the symmetry operations that can be performed on the unit cell, such as rotations, reflections, and inversions.

The crystal structure and symmetry play a critical role in determining many physical properties of a solid. For example, the cleavage of a crystal, which is the tendency of a crystal to break along certain planes, is directly related to the symmetry of the crystal structure. Additionally, the electronic band structure and optical transparency of a crystal are also influenced by its crystal structure and symmetry.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of a crystalline lattice, which is the underlying structure of a crystal. A crystalline lattice is a regular arrangement of points in three-dimensional space, with each point representing the location of an atom, ion, or molecule. The type of crystalline lattice present in a crystal is determined by the type of bonding between the constituent particles.

### Section 1.1b Unit Cell and Lattice Parameters

The unit cell is a fundamental concept in the study of crystalline lattices. It is the smallest repeating unit that has the full symmetry of the crystal structure. The geometry of the unit cell is described as a parallelepiped, providing six lattice parameters taken as the lengths of the cell edges ("a", "b", "c") and the angles between them (α, β, γ).

The positions of particles inside the unit cell are described by the fractional coordinates ("x<sub>i</sub>", "y<sub>i</sub>", "z<sub>i</sub>") along the cell edges, measured from a reference point. These coordinates are crucial in understanding the symmetry of the crystal structure. For example, if a particle is located at the coordinates (0, 0, 0), it means that the particle is located at the center of the unit cell. If a particle is located at the coordinates (1/2, 1/2, 1/2), it means that the particle is located at the center of the face opposite to the one containing the origin.

The unit cell is defined as the smallest repeating unit that has the full symmetry of the crystal structure. This means that all other particles of the unit cell are generated by the symmetry operations that characterize the symmetry of the unit cell. The collection of symmetry operations of the unit cell is expressed formally as the space group of the crystal structure.

The space group is a set of 230 possible symmetric arrangements of particles in three-dimensional space. These space groups are classified based on the symmetry operations that can be performed on the unit cell, such as rotations, reflections, and inversions. The space group of a crystal structure is crucial in understanding its symmetry and physical properties.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of Miller indices, which are used to describe vectors and planes in a crystal lattice.

These space groups are classified based on the symmetry operations that can be performed on the unit cell, such as rotations, reflections, and inversions. The space group of a crystal structure is crucial in understanding its symmetry and physical properties.

The lattice parameters, "a", "b", "c", α, β, and γ, are crucial in understanding the geometry of the unit cell. The lengths of the cell edges ("a", "b", "c") determine the size of the unit cell, while the angles between them (α, β, γ) determine its shape. These parameters are used to calculate the volume of the unit cell, which is given by the formula:

$$
V = a^2b\sin\gamma + b^2c\sin\alpha + c^2a\sin\beta
$$

where "a", "b", and "c" are the lengths of the cell edges, and α, β, and γ are the angles between them.

The lattice parameters also play a crucial role in determining the density of the crystal structure. The density of a crystal structure is given by the formula:

$$
\rho = \frac{Z}{V}
$$

where "Z" is the number of particles in the unit cell and "V" is the volume of the unit cell. By manipulating the lattice parameters, we can control the density of the crystal structure, which in turn affects its physical properties.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of Miller indices, which are used to describe vectors and planes in a crystal lattice.




### Subsection 1.1c Bravais Lattice

The Bravais lattice is a concept in crystallography that describes the arrangement of lattice points in a crystal structure. It is named after the French mathematician and physicist Augustin-Louis Cauchy and the French mathematician and physicist Louis-Marie-Auguste Bourdon de l'Oiseau.

In three-dimensional space, there are 14 Bravais lattices. These are obtained by combining one of the seven lattice systems with one of the centering types. The centering types identify the locations of the lattice points in the unit cell as follows:

1. Primitive (P) - Each lattice point is only located at the corners of the unit cell.
2. Body-centered cubic (I) - In addition to the corners, there is a lattice point at the center of the unit cell.
3. Face-centered cubic (F) - In addition to the corners, there is a lattice point at the center of each face of the unit cell.
4. Base-centered cubic (C) - In addition to the corners, there is a lattice point at the center of the base of the unit cell.
5. Body-centered tetragonal (I) - Similar to body-centered cubic, but with different lattice parameters.
6. Face-centered tetragonal (F) - Similar to face-centered cubic, but with different lattice parameters.
7. Body-centered hexagonal (I) - Similar to body-centered cubic, but with different lattice parameters and a hexagonal unit cell.
8. Face-centered hexagonal (F) - Similar to face-centered cubic, but with different lattice parameters and a hexagonal unit cell.
9. Body-centered orthorhombic (I) - Similar to body-centered cubic, but with different lattice parameters and an orthorhombic unit cell.
10. Face-centered orthorhombic (F) - Similar to face-centered cubic, but with different lattice parameters and an orthorhombic unit cell.
11. Base-centered orthorhombic (C) - Similar to base-centered cubic, but with different lattice parameters and an orthorhombic unit cell.
12. Body-centered monoclinic (I) - Similar to body-centered cubic, but with different lattice parameters and a monoclinic unit cell.
13. Face-centered monoclinic (F) - Similar to face-centered cubic, but with different lattice parameters and a monoclinic unit cell.
14. Base-centered monoclinic (C) - Similar to base-centered cubic, but with different lattice parameters and a monoclinic unit cell.

Not all combinations of lattice systems and centering types are needed to describe all of the possible lattices, as it can be shown that several of these are in fact equivalent to each other. For example, the monoclinic I lattice can be described by a monoclinic C lattice by different choice of crystal axes. Similarly, all A- or B-centered lattices can be described either by a C- or P-centering. This reduces the number of combinations to 14 conventional Bravais lattices, shown in the table below. Below each diagram is the Pearson symbol for that Bravais lattice.

| Bravais Lattice | Pearson Symbol |
| --- | --- |
| Primitive (P) | P |
| Body-centered cubic (I) | I |
| Face-centered cubic (F) | F |
| Base-centered cubic (C) | C |
| Body-centered tetragonal (I) | I4 |
| Face-centered tetragonal (F) | F4 |
| Body-centered hexagonal (I) | I6 |
| Face-centered hexagonal (F) | F6 |
| Body-centered orthorhombic (I) | I21 |
| Face-centered orthorhombic (F) | F21 |
| Base-centered orthorhombic (C) | C21 |
| Body-centered monoclinic (I) | I2 |
| Face-centered monoclinic (F) | F2 |
| Base-centered monoclinic (C) | C2 |

The unit cells are specified according to six lattice parameters which are the relative lengths of the cell edges ("a", "b", "c") and the angles between them ("α", "β", "γ"). The volume of the unit cell is given by the formula:

$$
V = a^2b\sin\alpha + b^2c\sin\beta + c^2a\sin\gamma - 2abc\sin\alpha\sin\beta\sin\gamma
$$

The positions of particles inside the unit cell are described by the fractional coordinates ("x<sub>i</sub>", "y<sub>i</sub>", "z<sub>i</sub>") along the cell edges, measured from a reference point. These coordinates are crucial in understanding the symmetry of the crystal structure. For example, if a particle is located at the coordinates (0, 0, 0), it means that the particle is located at the center of the unit cell. If a particle is located at the coordinates (1/2, 1/2, 1/2), it means that the particle is located at the center of the face opposite to the one containing the origin.

The unit cell is defined as the smallest repeating unit that has the full symmetry of the crystal structure. This means that all other particles of the unit cell are generated by the symmetry operations that characterize the symmetry of the unit cell. The collection of symmetry operations of the unit cell is expressed formally as the space group of the crystal structure.

These space groups are classified based on the symmetry operations that can be performed on the unit cell, such as rotations, reflections, and inversions. The space group of a crystal structure is crucial in understanding its symmetry and physical properties.

### Subsection 1.1d Miller Indices

Miller indices are a notation system used in crystallography for planes and directions in crystal lattices. They are named after the American physicist Henry H. Miller, who first introduced them in 1901.

#### 1.1d.1 Miller Indices for Planes

Miller indices are used to denote planes in a crystal lattice. A plane is defined by three integers, denoted as `h`, `k`, and `ℓ`. These indices are inversely proportional to the intercepts of the plane with the unit cell. In other words, a plane with Miller indices (`h`, `k`, `ℓ`) intercepts the three points `a1/h`, `a2/k`, and `a3/ℓ`, or some multiple thereof.

For example, a plane with Miller indices (1, 0, 0) is parallel to the `x`-axis and intercepts the `y`-axis at a distance of `a2/1 = a2`. Similarly, a plane with Miller indices (0, 1, 0) is parallel to the `y`-axis and intercepts the `x`-axis at a distance of `a1/0 = ∞`.

#### 1.1d.2 Miller Indices for Directions

Miller indices are also used to denote directions in a crystal lattice. A direction is defined by three integers, denoted as `h`, `k`, and `ℓ`. These indices are inversely proportional to the components of the direction vector along the unit cell vectors. In other words, a direction with Miller indices (`h`, `k`, `ℓ`) has components `h`, `k`, and `ℓ` along the `x`, `y`, and `z` axes, respectively.

For example, a direction with Miller indices (1, 1, 0) has components `1`, `1`, and `0` along the `x`, `y`, and `z` axes, respectively. This direction is parallel to the plane with Miller indices (1, 1, 0).

#### 1.1d.3 Miller Indices and Crystallographic Symmetry

Miller indices play a crucial role in the study of crystallographic symmetry. The symmetry of a crystal structure can be described by its space group, which is a set of symmetry operations that leave the crystal structure invariant. The Miller indices of a plane or direction can be used to determine its symmetry under the operations of the space group.

For example, the (1, 1, 0) plane and direction are both perpendicular to the `z`-axis and are invariant under rotations around the `z`-axis. This means that the (1, 1, 0) plane and direction belong to the `C_{∞v}` point group, which is the symmetry group of a screw axis.

In conclusion, Miller indices provide a powerful tool for describing planes and directions in crystal lattices. They are essential for understanding the symmetry and structure of crystals, and are widely used in the study of materials and their properties.
