In conclusion, Microsoft's business strategy is complex and multifaceted, involving a diverse product portfolio, targeted market segmentation, and various pricing strategies. The company's capability management framework also plays a crucial role in ensuring the successful execution of its business strategy. 





### Subsection 1.3b Organizational Structure of Microsoft

Microsoft's organizational structure is complex and dynamic, reflecting the company's diverse product portfolio and global reach. The company is organized into several divisions, each responsible for a specific product or group of products. These divisions are further divided into teams, each with a specific focus such as development, marketing, or support.

#### 1.3b.1 Divisions

Microsoft's divisions are responsible for the development, marketing, and support of specific products or groups of products. These divisions include:

- Windows and Devices Division: This division is responsible for the development and marketing of the Windows operating system and related devices.
- Office Division: This division is responsible for the development and marketing of the Microsoft Office suite.
- Server and Tools Division: This division is responsible for the development and marketing of server software and tools.
- Business Division: This division is responsible for the development and marketing of business-focused software and services.
- Entertainment and Devices Division: This division is responsible for the development and marketing of entertainment and device-focused software and services.

#### 1.3b.2 Teams

Each division at Microsoft is further divided into teams, each with a specific focus. These teams are responsible for the day-to-day operations and decision-making within their respective areas. For example, the Windows and Devices Division is divided into teams responsible for the development of different versions of Windows, such as Windows 10 and Windows Server.

#### 1.3b.3 Matrix Structure

In addition to its functional structure, Microsoft also uses a matrix structure to organize its employees. This structure groups employees by both function and product simultaneously. This allows for a balance between functional and decentralized forms of organization, and enables the company to take advantage of the strengths of both.

The matrix structure can be complex and challenging to manage, but it also allows for increased efficiency and flexibility. For example, a company that produces two products, "product A" and "product B", would organize its functions within the company as follows: "product A" sales department, "product A" customer service department, "product A" accounting, "product B" sales department, "product B" customer service department, "product B" accounting department.

#### 1.3b.4 Advantages and Disadvantages

The matrix structure has its advantages and disadvantages. Some of the disadvantages include tendencies towards anarchy, power struggles, and "sinking" to group and division levels. The matrix structure also increases the complexity of the chain of command, which can be confusing for employees to understand who is next in the chain of command. Additionally, the matrix structure can result in conflicting loyalties of employees.

However, the matrix structure also has significant advantages that make it valuable for companies to use. The matrix structure allows for a balance between functional and decentralized forms of organization, which can lead to increased efficiency and flexibility. It also allows for the effective management of a diverse product portfolio and global reach. 





### Subsection 1.3c Management Practices at Microsoft

Microsoft's management practices are a crucial aspect of its organizational structure and culture. These practices are designed to ensure the efficient and effective operation of the company, and to foster a culture of innovation and continuous improvement.

#### 1.3c.1 Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)

Microsoft has adopted the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) as its primary process improvement approach. CMMI is a process improvement approach that provides a set of best practices for developing and maintaining products and services. It is used to guide process improvement across an organization, and is widely adopted in the software industry.

The SEI published a study showing that 60 organizations that implemented CMMI saw increases in performance in the categories of cost, schedule, productivity, quality, and customer satisfaction. The median increase in performance varied between 14% (customer satisfaction) and 62% (productivity). However, the CMMI model mostly deals with "what" processes should be implemented, and not so much with "how" they can be implemented. These results do not guarantee that applying CMMI will increase performance in every organization. A small company with few resources may be less likely to benefit from CMMI; this view is supported by the process maturity profile (page 10). Of the small organizations (<25 employees), 70.5% are assessed at level 2: Managed, while 52.8% of the organizations with 1,001–2,000 employees are rated at the highest level (5: Optimizing).

#### 1.3c.2 Agile Software Development

In addition to CMMI, Microsoft also embraces agile software development practices. Agile is a set of principles and practices for software development that emphasizes customer satisfaction, collaboration, and adaptability. It is often contrasted with traditional "waterfall" development methods, which are more sequential and less adaptable.

Turner & Jain (2002) argue that although there are large differences between CMMI and agile software development, both approaches have much in common. They believe neither way is the 'right' way to develop software, but that there are phases in a project where one of the two is better suited. They suggest one should combine the different fragments of the methods into a new hybrid method. Sutherland et al. (2007) assert that a combination of Scrum and CMMI brings more adaptability and predictability than either one alone. David J. Anderson (2005) gives hints on how to interpret CMMI in an agile manner.

#### 1.3c.3 CMMI Roadmaps

CMMI Roadmaps, which are a goal-driven approach to selecting and deploying relevant process areas from the CMMI-DEV model, can provide guidance and focus for effective CMMI adoption. There are several CMMI roadmaps for the continuous representation, each with a specific set of improvement goals. Examples are the CMMI Project Roadmap, CMMI Product and Product Integration Roadmaps and the CMMI Process and Measurements Roadmaps. These roadmaps can help organizations navigate the complexities of CMMI adoption and ensure that their efforts are focused on the areas that will provide the most benefit.

##### Business Models for Open-Source Software

Companies whose business centers on the development of open-source software employ a variety of business models to solve the challenge of how to make money providing software that is by definition licensed free of charge. Each of these business strategies rests on the premise that users of open-source technologies are willing to purchase additional software features under proprietary licenses, or purchase other services or elements of value that complement the open-source software that is core to the business. This additional value can be, but not limited to, enterprise-grade features and up-time guarantees (often via a service-level agreement) to satisfy business or compliance requirements, performance and efficiency gains by features not yet available in the open source version, legal protection (e.g., indemnification from copyright or patent infringement), or professional support/training/consulting that are typical of proprietary software applications.

Historically, these business models started in the late 1990s and early 2000s as "dual-licensing" models, for example MySQL, and have matured over time to include many variations, as described in the sections below. Pure dual licensing models are not uncommon, as a more nuanced business approach to open source software businesses has developed. Many of these variations are referred to an "open core" model, where the companies develop both open source software elements and other elements of value for a combined product.

A variety of open-source compatible business approaches have gained prominence in recent years, as illustrated and tracked by the Commercial Open Source Software Index (COSSI), a list of commercial open source companies that have reached at least US$100 million in revenue. Notable examples include open core (sometimes referred to as "dual licensing"), subscription-based models, and services-based models.

##### Open Core Business Model

The open core business model is a variation of the dual licensing model. In this model, the company develops both open source software elements and other elements of value for a combined product. The open source elements are available for free, while the other elements are available under a proprietary license for a fee. This model allows companies to provide a free, open source version of their software while also offering a more feature-rich, proprietary version for those willing to pay.

##### Subscription-Based Model

The subscription-based model is another popular business model for open-source software. In this model, users pay a subscription fee for access to the software and related services. This model is often used for software that requires frequent updates or support, as it allows companies to generate recurring revenue.

##### Services-Based Model

The services-based model is a business model where the company provides services related to the open-source software, such as training, consulting, or support, for a fee. This model is often used for complex open-source software that requires specialized knowledge to implement and maintain.

In conclusion, the open source business models are essential for companies whose business centers on the development of open-source software. These models allow companies to generate revenue while providing users with high-quality, open-source software. As the open source software market continues to grow, it is likely that we will see the development of new and innovative business models.

This method is useful for identifying critical tasks and their dependencies, allowing project managers to focus on these tasks and ensure they are completed on time.

#### Earned Value Management (EVM)

Earned Value Management (EVM) is a project management technique used to track project performance and progress. It involves comparing the planned value (PV) of work scheduled to be completed, the actual cost (AC) incurred, and the earned value (EV) of work actually completed. By comparing these values, project managers can identify any variances and take corrective action to keep the project on track.

#### Risk Management

Risk management is a crucial aspect of project execution. It involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential risks that could impact the project's success. By proactively managing risks, project managers can minimize their impact on the project and ensure its success.

#### Conclusion

In this subsection, we have discussed some of the techniques used in project execution. These techniques are essential for ensuring the successful implementation of a project plan and achieving the project's objectives. By utilizing these techniques, project managers can effectively manage project resources, monitor and control project progress, and deliver project outcomes that meet the project's objectives.

### Related Context
```
# Software quality

In the context of software engineering, software quality refers to two related but distinct notions:


Many aspects of structural quality can be evaluated only statically through the analysis of the software inner structure, its source code (see Software metrics), at the unit level, and at the system level (sometimes referred to as end-to-end testing), which is in effect how its architecture adheres to sound principles of software architecture outlined in a paper on the topic by Object Management Group (OMG).

However some structural qualities, such as usability, can be assessed only dynamically (users or others acting on their behalf interact with the software or, at least, some prototype or partial implementation; even the interaction with a mock version made in cardboard represents a dynamic test because such version can be considered a prototype). Other aspects, such as reliability, might involve not only the software but also the underlying hardware, therefore, it can be assessed both statically and dynamically (stress test).

Functional quality is typically assessed dynamically but it is also possible to use static tests (such as software reviews).

Historically, the structure, classification and terminology of attributes and metrics applicable to software quality management have been derived or extracted from the ISO 9126 and the subsequent ISO/IEC 25000 standard. Based on these models (see Models), the Consortium for IT Software Quality (CISQ) has defined five major desirable structural characteristics needed for a piece of software to provide business value: Reliability, Efficiency, Security, Maintainability and (adequate) Size.

Software quality measurement quantifies to what extent a software program or system rates along each of these five dimensions. An aggregated measure of software quality can be computed through a qualitative or a quantitative scoring scheme or a mix of both and then a weighting system reflecting the priorities. This is where software quality assurance comes into play.

It involves a systematic approach to testing and evaluating the software to identify and address any potential defects or flaws. This section will discuss the key steps involved in implementing software QA in projects.

#### 20.1c.1 Planning and Executing QA Activities

The first step in implementing software QA is to plan and execute QA activities. This involves defining the scope of the QA activities, identifying the resources required, and assigning roles and responsibilities. The QA activities should be aligned with the project's objectives and should be executed in a timely manner to ensure the project's success.

#### 20.1c.2 Conducting Quality Reviews

Quality reviews are an essential part of software QA. They involve the examination of the software's design, development, and testing processes to identify any potential flaws or areas for improvement. Quality reviews can be conducted at various stages of the project, including the planning, design, construction, and integration phases. They can also be conducted on a periodic basis to ensure the ongoing quality of the software.

#### 20.1c.3 Testing the Software

Testing the software is another critical aspect of software QA. It involves the execution of tests to verify that the software meets the specified requirements and functions as intended. The testing process should be comprehensive and should cover all aspects of the software, including its functionality, performance, reliability, and security. The results of the tests should be documented and used to identify and address any defects or flaws in the software.

#### 20.1c.4 Continuous Improvement

Continuous improvement is a key aspect of software QA. It involves the ongoing evaluation and improvement of the QA processes and procedures to ensure their effectiveness and efficiency. This can be achieved through the use of metrics and measurements to track the QA activities and their outcomes, and through the implementation of corrective and preventive actions to address any issues or flaws identified during the QA process.

#### 20.1c.5 Managing QA Risks

Managing QA risks is a crucial aspect of implementing software QA in projects. It involves identifying, assessing, and mitigating the risks associated with the QA activities. This can be achieved through the use of risk management tools and techniques, such as risk registers and risk assessments, to identify and prioritize the risks, and through the implementation of risk mitigation strategies to address the identified risks.

In conclusion, implementing software QA in projects is a complex but essential process. It requires a systematic approach, the involvement of all project stakeholders, and the use of various QA tools and techniques. By following these steps, organizations can ensure the delivery of high-quality software that meets the needs and expectations of their customers.
