### Subsection: 3.2a Introduction to Multi-commodity Flows

The multi-commodity flow problem is a network flow problem with multiple commodities (flow demands) between different source and sink nodes. In the context of airline schedule planning and optimization, this problem is crucial for understanding the flow of passengers and their preferences.

## Definition

Given a flow network $G(V,E)$, where edge $(u,v) \in E$ has capacity $c(u,v)$. There are $k$ commodities $K_1,K_2,\dots,K_k$, defined by $K_i=(s_i,t_i,d_i)$, where $s_i$ and $t_i$ is the source and sink of commodity $i$, and $d_i$ is its demand. The variable $f_i(u,v)$ defines the fraction of flow $i$ along edge $(u,v)$, where $f_i(u,v) \in [0,1]$ in case the flow can be split among multiple paths, and $f_i(u,v) \in \{0,1\}$ otherwise (i.e. "single path routing"). Find an assignment of all flow variables which satisfies the following four constraints:

(1) Link capacity: The sum of all flows routed over a link does not exceed its capacity.

(2) Flow conservation on transit nodes: The amount of a flow entering an intermediate node $u$ is the same that exits the node.

(3) Flow conservation at the source: A flow must exit its source node completely.

(4) Flow conservation at the destination: A flow must enter its sink node completely.

## Corresponding Optimization Problems

The multi-commodity flow problem can be used to solve various optimization problems, such as load balancing, minimum cost multi-commodity flow, and maximum multi-commodity flow. These problems aim to optimize different aspects of the flow network, such as minimizing costs or maximizing the total flow.

### Load Balancing

Load balancing is the attempt to route flows such that the utilization $U(u,v)$ of all links $(u,v)\in E$ is even, where

$$
U(u,v) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} f_i(u,v)}{c(u,v)}
$$

The problem can be solved e.g. by minimizing $\sum_{u,v\in V} (U(u,v))^2$. A common linearization of this problem is the minimization of the maximum utilization $U_{max}$, where

$$
U_{max} = \max_{u,v\in V} U(u,v)
$$

### Minimum Cost Multi-commodity Flow

In the minimum cost multi-commodity flow problem, there is a cost $a(u,v) \cdot f(u,v)$ for sending a flow on $(u,v)$. The goal is to minimize the total cost of all flows.

### Maximum Multi-commodity Flow

In the maximum multi-commodity flow problem, the demand of each commodity is not fixed, and the total throughput of the network is maximized. This problem is often used in network design and traffic engineering.

In the next section, we will explore how the multi-commodity flow problem can be applied to airline schedule planning and optimization.

### Subsection: 3.3a Introduction to Keypath Formulation

The Keypath Formulation is a mathematical model used in the optimization of airline schedules. It is a variation of the multi-commodity flow model and is particularly useful in the context of the Passenger Mix Model. The Keypath Formulation is based on the concept of a keypath, which is a path in the network that represents the flow of passengers between different destinations.

The Keypath Formulation is defined as follows:

Given a directed graph $G = (V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of nodes and $E$ is the set of edges, and a set of keypaths $K \subseteq E^*$, where $E^*$ is the set of all paths in $G$, the Keypath Formulation is the following linear program:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{maximize} \quad & \sum_{k \in K} \sum_{p \in k} f_p \\
\text{subject to} \quad & \sum_{p \in k} f_p \leq c_k, \quad \forall k \in K \\
& f_p \geq 0, \quad \forall p \in E \\
\end{align*}
$$

where $f_p$ is the flow on path $p$, and $c_k$ is the capacity of keypath $k$. The objective is to maximize the total flow on the keypaths, subject to the capacity constraints on the keypaths and the non-negativity constraints on the flows.

The Keypath Formulation is particularly useful in the context of the Passenger Mix Model, as it allows us to model the flow of different types of passengers (e.g., business, leisure, etc.) between different destinations.

## Current challenges

Current challenges in the SSW field include a lack of standardization, which slows down the growth rate of sensors created to measure things. For the semantic sensor web to be meaningful, the languages, tags, and labels across various applications, developed by various developers, must be the same. Unfortunately, due to scattered development of various architectures, such standardization is not possible. This problem is called vastness.

There is also the problem of inconsistency, such that when changing the architecture of an existing solution, the system logic will no longer hold. In order to resolve this problem, there is a need for an extensive amount of resources (depending on the size and complexity of system). For example, many existing systems use twelve bits to transfer temperature data to a local computer. However, in a SSW 16 bits of data is acceptable. This inconsistency results in higher data traffic with no additional accuracy improvement. In order for the old system to improve, there is a need of allocating extra bits and changing the buffer requirements, which is costly. Assuming the resources required to make the tag requirement are available, there is still the existence of unnecessary data that requires additional storage space in addition to creating confusion for other SSW members. The only solution remaining is changing the hardware requirements, which requires a lot of resources # DOS Protected Mode Interface

As governments and international organizations continue to implement new regulations and policies, airlines must adapt to these changes and ensure compliance. This can be particularly challenging for airlines operating in multiple countries, as they must navigate through different regulatory frameworks.

For instance, the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union has brought about significant changes in the way airlines collect and use customer data. Airlines must now comply with strict data protection regulations and face potential penalties for non-compliance.

#### 20.3c.3 Competitive Pressures

Competitive pressures in the airline industry are also expected to increase in the future. With the rise of low-cost carriers and the increasing popularity of shared economy services, traditional airlines are facing increased competition. This puts pressure on airlines to continuously improve their operations and offerings to remain competitive.

Moreover, the rise of digital technologies has also led to the emergence of new players in the airline industry. Online travel agencies and meta-search engines are becoming more popular, allowing customers to compare and book flights from multiple airlines. This adds another layer of competition for traditional airlines.

In conclusion, the future of airline strategic management will be shaped by a variety of challenges, including technological advancements, regulatory changes, and competitive pressures. Airlines must be prepared to adapt and innovate in order to stay ahead in the ever-evolving airline industry.
