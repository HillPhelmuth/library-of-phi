# Transportation Policy and Environmental Limits: Navigating the Path to Sustainable Mobility":


## Foreward

Welcome to "Transportation Policy and Environmental Limits: Navigating the Path to Sustainable Mobility". This book aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationship between transportation policy, environmental limits, and sustainable mobility. As our world continues to face pressing challenges such as climate change, urbanization, and resource depletion, it is crucial that we navigate this path with careful consideration and a holistic approach.

The concept of Transportation Demand Management (TDM) has emerged as a key component in this journey. As transportation professionals have noted, TDM is often misunderstood as a collection of vaguely related initiatives, limiting its true potential. However, when framed as a philosophical approach, TDM can become a cornerstone of sustainable urban transport systems. This book will delve into the intricacies of TDM, exploring its role in integrating transportation planning, daily management, and operation of transport services and infrastructure.

We will also explore the concept of "mobility management" and "active travel management", which fall under the umbrella of TDM. These concepts are crucial to the delivery of a sustainable urban transport system, and their integration into urban transport planning and daily management is a key focus of this book.

However, managing travel demand has often been compartmentalized as a set of "soft measures" to promote sustainable travel options or programs to promote and offer shared ride arrangements. This book will challenge this narrow view, highlighting the need for a more holistic approach that integrates various disciplines and perspectives.

The concept of TDM has become confused as each discipline has tried to mold it to their set of tools. This "silo" thinking inhibits the kind of policy integration that is needed to develop a sustainable urban transport solution strategy. This book will explore different approaches to sustainable transport along a spectrum of viewpoints, ranging from weak to strong sustainability.

In writing this book, we hope to provide a comprehensive and accessible resource for students, researchers, and policymakers alike. We aim to equip readers with the knowledge and tools to navigate the path to sustainable mobility, and to contribute to the ongoing discussions and debates surrounding transportation policy and environmental limits.

Thank you for joining us on this journey. Let's navigate the path to sustainable mobility together.

### Subsection 1.1a: Role of Federal Government

The federal government plays a crucial role in managing transportation in the United States. As the government at the level of the sovereign state, it is responsible for maintaining national security, exercising international diplomacy, and making laws for the whole country. This includes the management of transportation systems, which are essential for economic growth and development.

The federal government's involvement in transportation is governed by the Constitution of the United States. The Constitution includes four sections: an introductory paragraph titled Preamble, a list of seven Articles that define the government's framework, an untitled closing endorsement, and the Bill of Rights. The Tenth Amendment of the Bill of Rights, in particular, limits the federal government's power over the states by reserving all powers not delegated to the federal government to the states.

However, the federal government's authority over transportation has been expanded by later amendments, particularly the Fourteenth Amendment. This amendment gives the federal government significant authority over states, including the power to regulate interstate commerce, which is crucial for managing transportation systems.

The federal government's involvement in transportation is also evident in its role as a provider of public goods. As mentioned in the related context, public goods are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, meaning that they are available to everyone and their consumption by one individual does not reduce their availability to others. The federal government provides public goods such as national defense, law and order, and transportation infrastructure, which are essential for the functioning of the economy.

In the context of transportation, the federal government is responsible for maintaining and improving the nation's transportation infrastructure, including roads, highways, railways, and air and sea ports. It also sets policies and regulations for transportation, such as fuel efficiency standards, safety regulations, and environmental regulations. These policies and regulations are crucial for promoting sustainable transportation practices and reducing the environmental impact of transportation.

In conclusion, the federal government plays a vital role in managing transportation in the United States. Its involvement is governed by the Constitution and has been expanded by later amendments. The federal government's role as a provider of public goods and its policies and regulations are essential for promoting sustainable transportation practices and reducing the environmental impact of transportation. 





### Subsection 1.1b: Role of State Government

The role of state governments in managing transportation is crucial, particularly in the United States where the federal government's authority over transportation is limited by the Constitution. State governments have the power to organize and structure their individual governments within the parameters set by the Constitution. This includes the power to legislate on matters on the concurrent list, appoint people to the state executive council, and organize their executive departments and agencies in any way they like.

At the state level, the legislature is unicameral, with the number of its members equal to three times the number of legislators it has in the Federal House of Representatives. This allows for a more direct representation of the people, as each state legislator represents a larger population than their federal counterparts.

The executive branch of every state is headed by an elected Governor. The Governor has the power to appoint people to the state executive council, subject to the advice and consent of the state house of assembly (legislature). This allows for a more direct accountability of the executive branch to the people, as the Governor is directly elected and the state house of assembly is elected by the people.

The judiciary is one of the co-equal arms of the state government concerned with the interpretation of the laws of the state government. The judiciary is headed by the chief justice of the state appointed by the governor subject to the approval of the state house of assembly. This allows for a more direct accountability of the judiciary to the people, as the chief justice is appointed by the Governor who is directly elected and the state house of assembly is elected by the people.

In the context of transportation, state governments play a crucial role in managing transportation systems within their borders. They are responsible for maintaining and improving the state's transportation infrastructure, including roads, highways, railways, and air and sea ports. They also have the power to regulate transportation within their borders, including setting speed limits, enforcing traffic laws, and managing public transportation systems.

### Subsection 1.1c: Role of Local Government

Local governments play a crucial role in managing transportation systems within their jurisdictions. They are responsible for planning, designing, and implementing transportation infrastructure and services that meet the needs of their communities. This includes roads, highways, public transportation systems, and pedestrian and cycling infrastructure.

Local governments in Australia, for instance, have a range of powers and functions that are approximately equal. However, larger cities such as Brisbane and the Gold Coast command more resources due to their larger population base. Unlike local governments in many other countries, services such as police, fire protection, and schools are provided by state or territory government rather than by local councils.

The primary responsibility of local governments in the first half of the 20th century was the provision of physical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, and sewerage. However, from the 1970s, the emphasis changed to community facilities such as libraries and parks, maintenance of local roads, town planning and development approvals, and local services such as waste disposal. Child care, tourism, and urban renewal were also beginning to be part of local governments' role. These are financed by collection of local land taxes known as "rates," and grants from the state and Commonwealth governments.

In recent years, the roles of local government areas in Australia have expanded as higher levels of government have devolved activities to the third tier. Examples include the provision of community health services, regional airports, and pollution control as well as community safety and accessible transport. This shift from 'services to property' towards 'services to people' has been driven by wider participation in decision making and transparent management practices.

Recent years have seen some State governments devolving additional powers onto LGAs. In Queensland and Western Australia, LGAs have been granted the power to independently enact their own local subsidiary legislation, in contrast to the previous system of by-laws. This has increased the autonomy and accountability of local governments in managing transportation systems within their jurisdictions.

In conclusion, local governments play a crucial role in managing transportation systems within their jurisdictions. Their powers and functions are constantly evolving to meet the changing needs of their communities. As we navigate the path to sustainable mobility, the role of local governments will continue to be a key factor in shaping transportation policy and environmental limits.




### Subsection 1.2a: Definition of Sustainable Transportation

Sustainable transportation is a concept that aims to balance the needs of the present and future generations while minimizing the negative impacts of transportation on the environment. It is a critical component of sustainable development, as transportation accounts for a significant portion of global carbon emissions and contributes to air pollution, noise pollution, and traffic congestion.

The European Commission defines sustainable mobility as "the movement of people and goods in a way that is safe, affordable, accessible, and environmentally friendly, while integrating the needs of all road users, including pedestrians, cyclists, and public transport users." This definition highlights the importance of considering the needs of all road users, not just those who use private vehicles.

The European Environment Agency (EEA) has identified six key areas for action to promote sustainable mobility:

1. Reducing the need to travel by promoting more sustainable patterns of consumption and production.
2. Encouraging the use of sustainable modes of transport, such as walking, cycling, and public transport.
3. Improving the efficiency of road transport, including freight transport.
4. Reducing the negative impacts of transport on the environment, such as air and noise pollution.
5. Promoting the use of renewable and low-carbon energy sources in transport.
6. Developing and implementing policies and measures at the local, regional, and national levels to promote sustainable mobility.

These areas of action provide a framework for understanding and implementing sustainable transportation. They emphasize the need for a holistic approach that considers not only the transportation system itself, but also the broader societal and environmental context in which it operates.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into each of these areas, exploring the challenges and opportunities they present, and discussing strategies for navigating the path to sustainable mobility.

One way to improve efficiency is through the use of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). ITS seek to improve safety, travel times, and minimize greenhouse gas emissions for all travelers, with a particular focus on drivers. ITS has two systems: one for data collection and relaying, and another for data processing. Data collection can be achieved through various means, such as video cameras, sensors, and mobile apps. This data is then processed to make informed decisions about traffic flow, congestion, and emissions.

Another way to improve efficiency is through the use of Advanced Public Transportation Systems (APTS). APTS aim to make public transportation more efficient and convenient for its riders. Electronic payment methods allow users to add money to their smart cards at stations and online. APTS also relay information to transit facilities about current vehicle locations to give riders expected wait times on screens at stations and directly to their smartphones. This not only improves the convenience of public transportation but also reduces congestion on the roads.

#### 1.2b.2 Sustainability

Sustainability is another key element of sustainable transportation. It refers to the ability of a transportation system to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainability is achieved through the use of renewable and low-carbon energy sources, such as electric vehicles and biofuels. It also involves reducing the negative impacts of transportation on the environment, such as air and noise pollution.

The European Environment Agency (EEA) has identified six key areas for action to promote sustainable mobility. These include reducing the need to travel, promoting sustainable modes of transport, improving the efficiency of road transport, reducing the negative impacts of transport on the environment, promoting the use of renewable and low-carbon energy sources, and developing and implementing policies and measures at the local, regional, and national levels.

#### 1.2b.3 Equity

Equity is a crucial element of sustainable transportation. It refers to the fair distribution of transportation benefits and burdens among different groups of people. Equity is achieved through the provision of affordable and accessible transportation options for all, regardless of their income, age, or ability. It also involves addressing the disproportionate impacts of transportation on marginalized communities, such as low-income and minority populations.

In conclusion, sustainable transportation is a complex and multifaceted concept that requires a comprehensive understanding of various elements. These elements work together to create a sustainable transportation system that is efficient, sustainable, and equitable. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into each of these elements and discuss their role in creating a sustainable transportation system.
