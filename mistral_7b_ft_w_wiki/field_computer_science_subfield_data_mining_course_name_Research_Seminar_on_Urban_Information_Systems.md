### Subsection: 2.1a Urban Redevelopment Theories

Urban redevelopment is a complex process that involves the transformation of urban spaces to address social, economic, and environmental challenges. It is a crucial aspect of urban planning and management, as it has the potential to improve the quality of life for urban residents and promote sustainable development. In this section, we will explore the various theories that guide urban redevelopment, including the sector model, the multiple nuclei model, and the smart city theory.

#### The Sector Model

The sector model, proposed by economist Homer Hoyt in 1939, is one of the earliest theories of urban structure. According to this model, a city develops in sectors instead of rings. Certain areas of a city are more attractive for various activities, whether by chance or geographic and environmental reasons. As the city grows and these activities flourish and expand outward, they do so in a wedge and become a sector of the city.

The sector model is a refinement of the concentric model proposed by sociologist Ernest Burgess. Both theories claim that Chicago supports their model. Burgess claimed that Chicago's central business district was surrounded by a series of rings, broken only by Lake Michigan. Hoyt, on the other hand, argued that the best housing developed north from the central business district along Lake Michigan, while industry located along major rail lines and roads to the south, southwest, and northwest.

Calgary, Alberta almost perfectly fits Hoyt's sector model. The city's downtown area, known as the "City Centre," is surrounded by sectors that are home to various activities, including high-income housing, industry, and entertainment.

#### The Multiple Nuclei Model

The multiple nuclei model, developed by geographers Chauncy Harris and Edward Ullman in 1945, is another theory of urban structure. According to this model, a city contains more than one center around which activities revolve. Some activities are attracted to particular nodes while others try to avoid them. For example, a university node may attract well-educated residents, pizzerias, and bookstores, whereas an airport may attract hotels and warehouses.

The multiple nuclei model provides a more nuanced understanding of urban structure compared to the sector model. It recognizes the diversity of activities and interests within a city, and how they are attracted to different nodes. This theory is particularly useful in understanding the development of urban spaces, as it highlights the role of various factors, such as transportation networks, economic opportunities, and social networks, in shaping urban development.

#### The Smart City Theory

The smart city theory is a relatively recent addition to the field of urban redevelopment. It is based on the concept of a city that uses technology and data to improve the quality of life for its residents, enhance sustainability, and promote economic development. The smart city theory recognizes the potential of information infrastructure to transform urban spaces and address the challenges of urbanization.

The smart city theory is closely related to the sector model and the multiple nuclei model. Like the sector model, it recognizes the importance of certain areas within a city for specific activities. Like the multiple nuclei model, it recognizes the diversity of activities and interests within a city, and how they are attracted to different nodes. However, the smart city theory adds a new dimension by emphasizing the role of information infrastructure in shaping urban spaces.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of information infrastructure and its role in urban redevelopment.




### Subsection: 2.1b Role of Information Infrastructure in Urban Redevelopment

Information infrastructure plays a crucial role in urban redevelopment. It provides the necessary tools and technologies for urban planners and developers to gather, analyze, and utilize data to make informed decisions about the development and management of urban spaces. In this section, we will explore the various ways in which information infrastructure contributes to urban redevelopment.

#### Data Collection and Analysis

Information infrastructure enables the collection and analysis of data about urban spaces. This data can include information about the physical environment, such as land use, building characteristics, and transportation networks, as well as social and economic data, such as demographics, employment patterns, and consumer behavior. By collecting and analyzing this data, urban planners and developers can gain a better understanding of the current state of the city and identify areas that need redevelopment.

#### Planning and Design

Information infrastructure also plays a crucial role in the planning and design of urban spaces. By providing access to data and tools for visualization and simulation, information infrastructure allows urban planners and developers to test different redevelopment scenarios and evaluate their potential impacts. This can help in making more informed decisions about the design and implementation of redevelopment projects.

#### Smart City Technologies

The concept of the "smart city" has gained significant attention in recent years, with the goal of using technology to improve the efficiency and sustainability of urban spaces. Information infrastructure is at the core of this concept, providing the foundation for the implementation of smart city technologies. These technologies can include sensors and data analytics for monitoring and managing urban systems, such as energy and water use, waste management, and traffic flow. They can also include digital platforms for citizen engagement and participation in the redevelopment process.

#### Challenges and Opportunities

While information infrastructure offers many opportunities for urban redevelopment, it also presents some challenges. One of the main challenges is the potential for unequal access to information and technology, which can exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities. However, with careful planning and implementation, information infrastructure can also be used to address these inequalities and promote more inclusive and equitable urban development.

In conclusion, information infrastructure plays a crucial role in urban redevelopment, providing the necessary tools and technologies for data collection and analysis, planning and design, and the implementation of smart city technologies. As urban spaces continue to evolve and face new challenges, the role of information infrastructure will only become more important in driving sustainable and equitable urban development.





### Subsection: 2.1c Case Studies in Urban Redevelopment

In this section, we will explore some case studies of urban redevelopment projects that have utilized information infrastructure to achieve their goals. These case studies will provide real-world examples of the theory and applications discussed in this chapter.

#### Case Study 1: The High Line, New York City

The High Line is a 1.45-mile-long elevated linear park built on a former freight rail line in New York City. The project was initiated by a community-based effort to prevent the abandoned rail line from being demolished. The information infrastructure played a crucial role in the planning and design of the High Line. Data about the surrounding neighborhood, including demographics, land use, and transportation patterns, was collected and analyzed to inform the design of the park. Additionally, smart city technologies, such as sensors and data analytics, were used to monitor and manage the park's energy and water use, waste management, and visitor flow.

#### Case Study 2: The Smart City of Songdo, South Korea

Songdo is a planned city in South Korea that is being built with the goal of becoming a smart city. The city's information infrastructure is being designed to support a wide range of smart city technologies, including intelligent transportation systems, energy management, and waste management. The city's information infrastructure is also being used to collect and analyze data about the city's residents and their behavior, which will be used to inform future urban planning and development decisions.

#### Case Study 3: The Smart City of Barcelona, Spain

Barcelona is a city that has been at the forefront of the smart city movement. The city's information infrastructure includes a comprehensive network of sensors and data analytics that are used to monitor and manage various aspects of the city, including traffic flow, energy use, and waste management. The city's information infrastructure has also been used to develop a range of smart city applications, such as a mobile app for reporting and tracking potholes and a web-based platform for managing and optimizing the city's waste collection services.

These case studies demonstrate the diverse ways in which information infrastructure can be used to support urban redevelopment projects.

## Chapter 3: Urban Information Systems and Urban Planning:




### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the concept of urban sprawl and its impact on urban areas. Urban sprawl refers to the uncontrolled expansion of urban areas, often resulting in the loss of natural resources and the displacement of communities. This phenomenon has become a major concern for urban planners and policymakers, as it poses significant challenges for sustainable development and quality of life in cities.

To better understand and address urban sprawl, we will delve into the use of cartograms as a tool for measuring and visualizing urban sprawl. Cartograms are maps that distort the size and shape of geographic areas to highlight specific characteristics or patterns. In the context of urban sprawl, cartograms can be used to visualize the extent of urban development and its impact on surrounding areas.

We will begin by discussing the theory behind urban sprawl and its causes, including factors such as population growth, economic development, and land use policies. We will then explore the various methods and techniques used to measure urban sprawl, including traditional methods such as land use maps and satellite imagery, as well as more advanced techniques such as remote sensing and GIS.

Next, we will delve into the applications of cartograms in measuring urban sprawl. We will discuss the different types of cartograms, such as area cartograms and density cartograms, and how they can be used to visualize urban sprawl in different contexts. We will also explore the advantages and limitations of using cartograms in urban planning and decision-making.

Finally, we will examine case studies of urban sprawl and the use of cartograms in these contexts. These case studies will provide real-world examples of how cartograms have been used to measure and address urban sprawl in different cities and regions. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of the theory and applications of cartograms in measuring urban sprawl.




### Subsection: 3.1a Understanding Urban Sprawl

Urban sprawl is a complex phenomenon that has been a major concern for urban planners and policymakers for decades. It refers to the uncontrolled expansion of urban areas, often resulting in the loss of natural resources and the displacement of communities. In this section, we will explore the theory behind urban sprawl and its causes, as well as the various methods and techniques used to measure and visualize it.

#### The Theory of Urban Sprawl

The theory of urban sprawl is based on the idea that urban areas tend to expand in a radial pattern, with new development occurring on the outskirts of existing urban areas. This is often driven by factors such as population growth, economic development, and land use policies. As urban areas expand, they often encroach on surrounding natural resources, leading to loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services.

One of the key theories behind urban sprawl is the concept of urbanization economics. This theory suggests that as urban areas grow, they become more economically efficient, leading to further expansion. This is due to the agglomeration economies that exist in urban areas, where firms and industries benefit from being located near each other. As a result, urban areas tend to grow larger and more dense over time.

#### Measuring Urban Sprawl

There are various methods and techniques used to measure urban sprawl. Traditional methods include land use maps and satellite imagery, which provide a visual representation of urban development. However, these methods can be subjective and may not accurately capture the extent of urban sprawl.

To address these limitations, more advanced techniques such as remote sensing and GIS have been developed. Remote sensing uses satellite imagery to measure changes in land use over time, providing a more objective and comprehensive view of urban sprawl. GIS, on the other hand, allows for the analysis of spatial data, including land use and population density, to better understand the patterns and impacts of urban sprawl.

#### The Role of Cartograms in Measuring Urban Sprawl

Cartograms are an important tool in measuring and visualizing urban sprawl. They are maps that distort the size and shape of geographic areas to highlight specific characteristics or patterns. In the context of urban sprawl, cartograms can be used to visualize the extent of urban development and its impact on surrounding areas.

There are two main types of cartograms used in measuring urban sprawl: area cartograms and density cartograms. Area cartograms distort the size of geographic areas based on a specific variable, such as population density or land use. Density cartograms, on the other hand, distort the shape of geographic areas based on a specific variable, such as population density or land use.

Cartograms have been used in various case studies to measure and address urban sprawl. For example, in the city of Montreal, Canada, a cartogram was used to visualize the extent of urban sprawl and identify areas at risk of further development. This information was then used to inform land use policies and promote more sustainable development.

In conclusion, understanding urban sprawl is crucial for addressing its impacts on urban areas and surrounding natural resources. By using advanced techniques such as remote sensing and GIS, and tools like cartograms, we can better measure and visualize urban sprawl, leading to more informed decision-making and sustainable development.





### Subsection: 3.1b Cartographic Techniques for Measuring Sprawl

Cartographic techniques have proven to be valuable tools for measuring urban sprawl. These techniques allow for a more comprehensive and objective view of urban development, taking into account factors such as population density, land use, and transportation networks.

#### Cartograms

One of the most commonly used cartographic techniques for measuring urban sprawl is the cartogram. A cartogram is a map that represents data in a visual and quantitative manner. In the context of urban sprawl, cartograms can be used to visualize changes in land use and population density over time.

Cartograms are particularly useful for measuring urban sprawl because they allow for a more accurate representation of urban development. Traditional maps may not accurately capture the extent of urban sprawl, as they often rely on subjective interpretations of land use and population density. Cartograms, on the other hand, use mathematical algorithms to assign values to different areas, providing a more objective view of urban development.

#### Integration with Urban Planning

The use of cartograms in measuring urban sprawl has important implications for urban planning. By providing a more accurate and comprehensive view of urban development, cartograms can help urban planners make more informed decisions about land use and transportation networks.

For example, cartograms can be used to identify areas of high population density, which may indicate a need for more efficient transportation networks or increased housing development. They can also be used to track changes in land use over time, allowing for more effective land use planning and management.

#### Challenges and Future Directions

While cartograms have proven to be valuable tools for measuring urban sprawl, there are still challenges that need to be addressed. One of the main challenges is the small displays of typical PDA user interfaces, which can limit the amount of contextual data that can be displayed.

In the future, advancements in technology and user interface design may help address this challenge. Additionally, further research is needed to explore the use of other cartographic techniques, such as network maps and isochrone maps, for measuring urban sprawl.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, cartograms have proven to be valuable tools for measuring urban sprawl. By providing a more accurate and comprehensive view of urban development, cartograms can help urban planners make more informed decisions about land use and transportation networks. As technology continues to advance, it is likely that cartograms will play an even larger role in measuring and managing urban sprawl.

### Subsection: 3.2a Xiongjiu Liao's Approach to Measuring Sprawl

Xiongjiu Liao, a renowned urban planner and researcher, has developed a unique approach to measuring urban sprawl. His approach, which is based on the concept of weighted urban proliferation, provides a comprehensive understanding of urban sprawl by considering both the physical expansion of urban areas and the intensity of urbanization.

#### The Concept of Weighted Urban Proliferation

Weighted urban proliferation is a measure of urban sprawl that takes into account the weight of urbanization in different areas. This weight is determined by the density of urbanization, with higher densities carrying more weight. The concept is based on the idea that not all urbanization is equal - a densely populated urban area has a greater impact on the environment and society than a sparsely populated one.

#### The Methodology

Liao's approach to measuring urban sprawl involves the use of cartograms, similar to the methodology discussed in the previous section. However, his approach also includes the calculation of weighted urban proliferation. This is done by assigning a weight to each urbanized area based on its density, and then calculating the total weight of urbanization in a given area.

#### The Results

Liao's approach has been applied to various urban areas, including the United States, Europe, and Canada. The results have shown a clear pattern of urban sprawl, with the majority of urbanization occurring in the suburbs and the weight of urbanization increasing in these areas. This approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of urban sprawl, taking into account not only the physical expansion of urban areas but also the intensity of urbanization.

#### The Implications

Liao's approach has important implications for urban planning and policy. By considering the weight of urbanization, it provides a more accurate measure of urban sprawl, which can inform decisions about land use and development. It also highlights the need for more sustainable urbanization practices, as areas with high weights of urbanization may face greater environmental and social impacts.

In conclusion, Xiongjiu Liao's approach to measuring urban sprawl provides a valuable tool for understanding and addressing the challenges of urbanization. By considering both the physical expansion and intensity of urbanization, it provides a more comprehensive understanding of urban sprawl and its implications.

### Subsection: 3.2c Critiques and Future Directions

While Xiongjiu Liao's study has provided valuable insights into urban sprawl, it is not without its criticisms. One of the main criticisms is the reliance on cartograms, which can be subjective and may not accurately reflect the physical expansion of urban areas. Additionally, the weighted urban proliferation method may not capture the complexities of urban sprawl, as it does not account for factors such as land use and transportation networks.

#### Critiques

The use of cartograms in Liao's study has been a point of contention. While they provide a useful visual representation of urban sprawl, they are based on subjective decisions about which factors to include and how to weight them. This can lead to different results depending on the specific choices made, making it difficult to compare across different urban areas.

The weighted urban proliferation method has also been criticized for its simplicity. By only considering the density of urbanization, it may not capture the full complexity of urban sprawl. For instance, it does not account for the quality of urbanization, such as the type of development or the accessibility of services.

#### Future Directions

Despite these criticisms, Liao's approach has opened up new avenues for future research. One direction is to incorporate more factors into the weighted urban proliferation method, such as land use and transportation networks. This could provide a more comprehensive understanding of urban sprawl and address some of the limitations of the current approach.

Another direction is to explore the use of other visualization techniques, such as heat maps or network diagrams, to represent urban sprawl. These methods may provide a different perspective on urban sprawl and complement the insights gained from cartograms.

Furthermore, there is a need for more empirical studies to validate and refine the methods used in Liao's study. This could involve conducting similar studies in different urban areas and comparing the results to gain a better understanding of the factors driving urban sprawl.

In conclusion, while there are criticisms of Liao's approach, it has provided valuable insights into urban sprawl and opened up new avenues for future research. By incorporating more factors and exploring different visualization techniques, we can continue to improve our understanding of urban sprawl and inform urban planning and policy.

# Urban informatics

## History

One of the first occurrences of the term can be found in Mark E. Hepworth's 1987 article "The Information City", which mentions the term "urban informatics" on page 261. However, Hepworth's overall discussion is more concerned with the broader notion of "informatics planning". Considering the article pre-dates the advent of ubiquitous computing and urban computing, it does contain some visionary thoughts about major changes on the horizon brought about by information and communications technology and the impact on cities.

The Urban Informatics Research Lab was founded at Queensland University of Technology in 2006, the first research group explicitly named to reflect its dedication to the study of urban informatics. The first edited book on the topic, the "Handbook of Research on Urban Informatics", published in 2009, brought together researchers and scholars from three broad domains: people, place, and technology; or, the social, the spatial, and the technical.

There were many precursors to this transdisciplinarity of "people, place, and technology." From an architecture, planning and design background, there is the work of the late William J. Mitchell, Dean of the MIT School of Architecture and Planning, and author of the 1995 book "City of Bits: Space, Place, and the Infobahn". Mitchell was influential in suggesting a profound relationship between place and technology at a time when mainstream interest was focused on the promise of the Information Superhighway and what Frances Cairncross called the "Death of Distance". Rather than a decline in the significance of place through remote work, distance education, and e-commerce, the physical / tangible layers of the city started to mix with the digital layers of the internet and online communications. Aspects of this trend have been studied under the terms community informatics and community networks.

One of the first texts that systematically examined the impact of information technology on urban planning and policy was "Information Technology and Urban Planning" by John A. W. Gunn. Published in 1987, this book explored the potential of information technology to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of urban planning processes. It also discussed the challenges and limitations of using information technology in urban planning, such as the potential for unequal access to information and the need for careful consideration of ethical and social implications.

Population density plays a crucial role in determining the need for transportation infrastructure, as higher population densities require more efficient and accessible transportation systems. Land use patterns also influence transportation systems, as they determine the distance between different destinations and the type of transportation needed to access them. Economic development is another important factor, as it affects the demand for transportation services and the ability of a city to invest in transportation infrastructure.

#### Information Technology in Urban Transportation Systems

Information technology has the potential to greatly improve the efficiency and sustainability of urban transportation systems. With the use of sensors, data analytics, and real-time communication, information technology can help optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve the overall user experience. For example, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) use data from various sources, such as GPS and loop sensors, to collect information about traffic conditions and make real-time adjustments to improve traffic flow. This can help reduce travel times and improve the overall reliability of transportation systems.

#### Challenges and Solutions for Urban Transportation Systems

Despite the potential benefits of information technology, urban transportation systems still face several challenges. These include traffic congestion, air pollution, and equity issues. Traffic congestion is a major concern in urban areas, as it not only leads to delays and increased travel times, but also contributes to air pollution. To address this challenge, cities can implement congestion pricing, where drivers are charged a fee for entering certain areas during peak hours. This can help reduce the number of vehicles on the road and encourage the use of alternative modes of transportation.

Air pollution is another major challenge for urban transportation systems, particularly in developing countries. The use of fossil fuels in private vehicles contributes to high levels of air pollution, which can have negative impacts on public health. To address this challenge, cities can implement policies that promote the use of alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit, walking, and cycling. This can help reduce the overall number of vehicles on the road and decrease air pollution.

Equity issues also play a role in urban transportation systems, as certain groups, such as low-income and marginalized communities, may have limited access to transportation services. To address this challenge, cities can implement policies that prioritize the needs of these groups, such as providing affordable public transit options and improving pedestrian and cycling infrastructure in low-income neighborhoods.

#### Future of Urban Transportation Systems

As technology continues to advance, the future of urban transportation systems looks promising. With the development of autonomous vehicles, electric vehicles, and shared mobility services, the way we travel in urban areas is likely to change significantly.

Understanding these systems is crucial for urban planners, policymakers, and researchers to make informed decisions and policies.

#### 13.1a.1 Housing Estates

Housing estates, also known as housing developments, are large-scale residential areas designed and built by a single developer. They are a common feature in urban areas, particularly in North America. In the United States, for instance, forms of housing estates include tract housing, apartment complexes, and public housing. These estates are often planned and designed with specific considerations, such as the needs of the target population, the local environment, and the overall urban development plan.

#### 13.1a.2 Urban Climatology and Spatial Planning

Urban climatology plays a significant role in decision-making for municipal planning and policy. It helps in understanding the impact of pollution, extreme heat events, and stormwater modeling on urban areas. For instance, in the city of Boston, urban climatology has been used to study the urban heat island effect, which refers to the phenomenon where urban areas are significantly warmer than their rural surroundings due to human activities. This knowledge can inform spatial planning and policy, helping to mitigate the negative effects of urbanization on the environment.

#### 13.1a.3 Housing and Public Policy

Housing and public policy are closely intertwined. Housing is a unique type of commodity because it is immobile, and when a household chooses a dwelling, it is also choosing a location. Urban economists analyze the location choices of households in conjunction with the market effects of housing policies. However, there are challenges in making this analysis, such as funding, uncertainty, space, and market structures. For example, the perfect market structure is often used as a benchmark, but in reality, housing markets are often characterized by imperfections such as monopolies, oligopolies, and market power.

#### 13.1a.4 Government Expenditures and Taxes

The final theme of local government expenditures and taxes relates to urban economics. It analyzes the efficiency of the fragmented local governments presiding in metropolitan areas. This is particularly relevant in the context of urban housing and real estate, as these systems are often subject to various local taxes and regulations. For instance, in the city of Boston, the local government expenditures and taxes are analyzed to understand their impact on the housing market. This information can inform policy decisions and help address issues such as housing affordability and gentrification.

#### 13.1a.5 Duplexes and Urban Planning

In urban planning, the term duplex is used more specifically. Major Canadian cities sometimes use the term duplex to refer specifically to a building with "one unit built above another". This definition can vary across different cities, but it generally refers to a building with two dwelling units. Understanding these definitions is crucial for urban planners and policymakers, as they help in planning and regulating the housing market. For instance, in the city of Toronto, the new Zoning Bylaw proposes to define 'Duplex Building' as a building that has only two dwelling units, and one dwelling unit is located above the other. This definition can inform policy decisions related to housing density, affordability, and urban design.

In the next sections, we will delve deeper into these topics, exploring their implications for urban housing and real estate systems.




### Subsection: 13.1b Role of Information Systems in Urban Housing and Real Estate

Information systems play a crucial role in urban housing and real estate. They provide a platform for the collection, storage, and analysis of data, which can be used to inform decision-making and policy development.

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are powerful tools for analyzing and visualizing spatial data. In the context of urban housing and real estate, GIS can be used to map and analyze various factors that influence housing and real estate markets, such as property values, housing affordability, and neighborhood characteristics.

For instance, GIS can be used to create maps that show the distribution of different types of housing in a city. This can help urban planners and policymakers identify areas with a high demand for housing, and inform decisions about where to build new housing developments.

GIS can also be used to analyze the impact of urban development on the environment. For example, it can be used to map the urban heat island effect, as mentioned in the previous section. This information can inform decisions about urban planning and policy, helping to mitigate the negative effects of urbanization on the environment.

#### 13.1b.2 Challenges of Data Collection and Analysis

Despite the potential benefits of information systems in urban housing and real estate, there are several challenges that need to be addressed. One of the main challenges is the collection and analysis of data.

The real estate industry is highly data-intensive, and accurate and up-to-date data is crucial for making informed decisions. However, collecting and analyzing this data can be a complex and time-consuming task. Real estate agents, for example, often rely on multiple listing services (MLS) to access and share data about properties. However, these services can be fragmented and incomplete, making it difficult to get a comprehensive view of the market.

Moreover, the analysis of real estate data can be a complex task. Real estate markets are influenced by a multitude of factors, including economic conditions, demographic trends, and local policies. Understanding these factors and how they interact can be a challenging task, requiring sophisticated data analysis techniques.

#### 13.1b.3 Future Directions

Despite these challenges, the role of information systems in urban housing and real estate is expected to grow in the future.

For instance, a smart city prototype might use sensors to collect data about traffic patterns, which can then be used to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion. Similarly, the prototype might use data analytics to identify patterns in energy consumption, which can inform energy-efficient practices and reduce energy costs.

#### 20.1c.2 Self-Healing Technology in Urban Infrastructure

Self-healing technology is another example of how information systems can be used in urban social services. This technology protects urban infrastructure, such as signposts, bollards, and street furniture, from damage and deterioration. When these items are impacted, the technology can repair the damage, reducing maintenance costs and improving the sustainability of urban developments.

The implementation of self-healing technology requires a robust information system that can monitor the condition of urban infrastructure and initiate repairs when necessary. This system also needs to be able to communicate with other systems, such as the smart grid, to ensure that repairs are carried out efficiently and effectively.

#### 20.1c.3 Renewable Energy in Urban Social Services

Renewable energy is a key component of sustainable urban development. Information systems play a crucial role in the implementation of renewable energy sources, which not only improve energy efficiency, but also the electricity demand of communication networks and the self-sufficiency of a city in the instance of disaster.

For instance, a smart grid can be used to manage the distribution of renewable energy, ensuring that it is used efficiently and effectively. This requires a sophisticated information system that can collect and analyze data about energy consumption, as well as the availability of renewable energy sources.

#### 20.1c.4 Electric Vehicles and Substations

Electric vehicles and substations are another example of how information systems can be used in urban social services. These systems can be used to manage the charging of electric vehicles, ensuring that it is done efficiently and effectively. They can also be used to monitor the condition of substations, and to initiate repairs when necessary.

The implementation of these systems requires a robust information system that can collect and analyze data about electric vehicle charging and substation condition. This system also needs to be able to communicate with other systems, such as the smart grid, to ensure that electric vehicle charging and substation maintenance are carried out efficiently and effectively.
