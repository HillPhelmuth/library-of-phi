### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of chemical equilibrium. Chemical equilibrium is a fundamental concept in chemistry that describes the balance between the forward and reverse reactions in a chemical system. It is a state where the concentrations of reactants and products remain constant over time, and there is no net change in the system. This concept is crucial in understanding the behavior of chemical systems and predicting their response to changes in conditions.

We will begin by exploring the concept of chemical equilibrium and its importance in chemical reactions. We will then discuss the factors that affect chemical equilibrium, such as temperature, pressure, and concentration. We will also cover the mathematical representation of chemical equilibrium using the equilibrium constant expression. This will allow us to quantitatively analyze and predict the behavior of chemical systems.

Furthermore, we will explore the Le Chatelier's principle, which states that a system at equilibrium will respond to any changes in conditions to maintain equilibrium. This principle is essential in understanding how chemical systems respond to changes in their environment.

Finally, we will discuss the concept of acid-base equilibrium and its role in chemical systems. We will explore the concept of pH and its relationship with the equilibrium of acid-base reactions. We will also cover the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which is used to calculate the pH of a buffer solution.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of chemical equilibrium and its importance in chemical systems. You will also be able to apply this knowledge to predict the behavior of chemical systems and understand their response to changes in conditions.

## Perturbation method

The Hamiltonian for helium with two electrons can be written as a sum of the Hamiltonians for each electron:
<math display="block"> H = \sum_{i=1}^2 h(i) = H_0 + H'</math>
where the zero-order unperturbed Hamiltonian is
<math display="block"> H_0 = -\frac{1}{2} \nabla_{r_1}^2 - \frac{1}{2} \nabla_{r_2}^2 - \frac{Z}{r_1} - \frac{Z}{r_2} </math>
while the perturbation term:
<math display="block"> H' = \frac{1}{r_{12}} </math>
is the electron-electron interaction. is just the sum of the two hydrogenic Hamiltonians:
<math display="block"> H_0 = \hat{h}_1 + \hat{h}_2 </math>
where
<math display="block"> \hat{h}_i = -\frac{1}{2} \nabla_{r_i}^2 - \frac{Z}{r_i}, i=1,2 </math>

, the energy eigenvalues and <math>\psi_{n_i,\ell_i,m_i}(\mathbf{r}_i) </math>, the corresponding eigenfunctions of the hydrogenic Hamiltonian will denote the normalized energy eigenvalues and the normalized eigenfunctions. So:
<math display="block"> \hat{h}_i \psi_{n_i,\ell_i,m_i}(\mathbf{r}_i) = E_{n_i} \psi_{n_i,\ell_i,m_i}(\mathbf{r}_i) </math>
where
<math display="block"> E_{n_i} = - \frac{1}{2} \frac{Z^2}{n_i^2} \text{ in a.u.} </math>

Neglecting the electron-electron repulsion term, the Schrödinger equation for the spatial part of the two-electron wave function will reduce to the 'zero-order' equation
<math display="block"> H_0\psi^{(0)}(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2) = E^{(0)} \psi^{(0)}(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2) </math>

This equation is solved by the product wave function:
<math display="block"> \psi^{(0)}(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2) = \psi_{n_1,\ell_1,m_1}(\mathbf{r}_1) \psi_{n_2,\ell_2,m_2}(\mathbf{r}_2) </math>
where <math>n_1</math> and <math>n_2</math> are the principal quantum numbers, and <math>\ell_1</math> and <math>\ell_2</math> are the azimuthal quantum numbers. The energy eigenvalues are then given by:
<math display="block"> E^{(0)} = - \frac{1}{2} \frac{Z^2}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{2} \frac{Z^2}{n_2^2} </math>

This is the lowest energy state of the system, and it corresponds to the ground state of the helium atom. The next higher energy state is obtained by promoting one of the electrons to a higher energy level. This can be done by increasing the principal quantum number <math>n</math> or the azimuthal quantum number <math>\ell</math>. The energy eigenvalues for these excited states are given by:
<math display="block"> E^{(0)} = - \frac{1}{2} \frac{Z^2}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{2} \frac{Z^2}{n_2^2} + \Delta E </math>
where <math>\Delta E</math> is the energy difference between the ground state and the excited state.

The product wave function <math>\psi^{(0)}(\mathbf{r}_1, \mathbf{r}_2)</math> is a good approximation for the ground state of the helium atom. However, it does not account for the electron-electron repulsion term, which becomes more important as the electrons are promoted to higher energy levels. This can be accounted for by including the perturbation term <math>H'</math> in the Schrödinger equation. The resulting equations are more complex and require numerical methods to solve.

In the next section, we will explore the properties of the helium atom, including its electronic structure and spectroscopic transitions. We will also discuss the concept of quantum numbers and how they relate to the energy levels of the atom.

### Section: 1.1b Subatomic Particles

The atom, once thought to be the smallest indivisible unit of matter, is now known to be composed of even smaller particles known as subatomic particles. These particles are the building blocks of the atom and play a crucial role in determining the properties and behavior of atoms.

#### Electrons

Electrons are the least massive of the three primary constituent particles of an atom. They have a negative electrical charge and a size that is too small to be measured using available techniques. The electron was first discovered by J.J. Thomson in the late 19th century. It is responsible for the negative charge of ions and plays a crucial role in the formation of chemical bonds.

#### Protons

Protons have a positive charge and a mass 1,836 times that of the electron. The number of protons in an atom is called its atomic number. Ernest Rutherford (1919) observed that nitrogen under alpha-particle bombardment ejects what appeared to be hydrogen nuclei. By 1920, he had accepted that the hydrogen nucleus is a distinct particle within the atom and named it proton. Protons are responsible for the positive charge of atoms and play a crucial role in nuclear reactions.

#### Neutrons

Neutrons have no electrical charge and have a free mass of 1,839 times the mass of the electron. They were first discovered by Rutherford in 1920. Neutrons are responsible for the neutral charge of atoms and play a crucial role in nuclear reactions.

#### Quarks

Quarks are even smaller particles that make up protons and neutrons. They are responsible for the stability of protons and neutrons and play a crucial role in nuclear reactions. There are six types of quarks, each with its own unique properties.

#### Gluons

Gluons are particles that mediate the strong nuclear force, which holds the quarks together in protons and neutrons. They are responsible for the stability of protons and neutrons and play a crucial role in nuclear reactions.

#### Other Particles

There are many other particles that have been discovered in the subatomic realm, including pions, kaons, and mesons. These particles play a crucial role in nuclear reactions and have been studied extensively in the field of particle physics.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the properties and behavior of these subatomic particles and how they contribute to the overall structure and function of atoms.





### Section: 1.1c Atomic Models Throughout History

The study of atoms and their structure has been a subject of interest for centuries. Over time, various atomic models have been proposed to explain the behavior of atoms and their interactions. These models have been refined and updated as new experimental evidence and theoretical calculations have been developed.

#### Dalton's Atomic Theory

The first scientific theory of atoms was proposed by John Dalton in the early 19th century. Dalton's atomic theory proposed that all elements are composed of tiny, indivisible particles called atoms. These atoms are identical in nature and cannot be subdivided or created. Dalton's theory also stated that atoms of the same element are identical in mass and properties, and that compounds are formed by a combination of two or more different kinds of atoms.

#### Thomson's Plum Pudding Model

In 1897, J.J. Thomson proposed the "plum pudding" model of the atom. In this model, the atom was envisioned as a sphere of positive charge with negatively charged electrons embedded within it. This model was based on Thomson's discovery of the electron and his observation that cathode rays, which he had shown to be composed of electrons, were deflected by electric and magnetic fields.

#### Rutherford's Gold Foil Experiment

In 1911, Ernest Rutherford conducted the famous gold foil experiment, which led to the development of the modern atomic model. Rutherford bombarded a thin sheet of gold with alpha particles and observed that most of the particles passed through the gold without deflection. However, a few particles were deflected significantly, indicating the presence of a dense, positively charged core within the atom. This experiment led to the development of the nuclear model of the atom.

#### Bohr's Planetary Model

In 1913, Niels Bohr proposed a model of the atom in which electrons moved in fixed orbits around the nucleus, similar to the planets around the sun. This model successfully explained the hydrogen spectrum, but failed to explain the spectra of other elements.

#### Schrödinger's Wave Equation

In 1926, Erwin Schrödinger proposed a wave equation to describe the behavior of electrons in atoms. This equation led to the development of quantum mechanics and the modern quantum mechanical model of the atom.

#### The Quantum Mechanical Model

The modern quantum mechanical model of the atom, developed in the early 20th century, describes the atom as a system of interacting particles (electrons, protons, and neutrons) governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. This model has been refined and expanded over the years to include the effects of relativity and the behavior of atoms in extreme conditions.

#### The Extended Periodic Table

The extended periodic table is a modern version of the periodic table that includes elements beyond the seventh period. This table is based on the electron configurations predicted for these elements, which are written starting with [Og] because oganesson (Z = 118) is expected to be the last known element with a closed-shell (inert gas) configuration. The configurations of the elements in this table are written starting with [Og] because oganesson is expected to be the last prior element with a closed-shell (inert gas) configuration, 1s<sup>2</sup> 2s<sup>2</sup> 2p<sup>6</sup> 3s<sup>2</sup> 3p<sup>6</sup> 3d<sup>10</sup> 4s<sup>2</sup> 4p<sup>6</sup> 4d<sup>10</sup> 4f<sup>14</sup> 5s<sup>2</sup> 5p<sup>6</sup> 5d<sup>10</sup> 5f<sup>14</sup> 6s<sup>2</sup> 6p<sup>6</sup> 6d<sup>10</sup> 7s<sup>2</sup> 7p<sup>6</sup>. Similarly, the [172] in the configurations for elements 173, 174, and 184 denotes the likely closed-shell configuration of element 172.

Beyond element 123, no complete calculations are available and hence the data in this table must be taken as tentative. In the case of element 123, and perhaps also heavier elements, several possible electron configurations are predicted to have very similar energy levels, such that it is very difficult to predict the ground state. All configurations that have been proposed (since it was understood that the Madelung rule probably stops working here) are included.

The predicted block assignments up to 172 are Kulsha's predictions.

#### The Quantum Mechanical Model

The modern quantum mechanical model of the atom, developed in the early 20th century, describes the atom as a system of interacting particles (electrons, protons, and neutrons) governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. This model has been refined and expanded over the years to include the effects of relativity and the behavior of atoms in extreme conditions.
