## Chapter 1: Introduction to seismic wave propagation:

### Introduction

Seismic wave propagation is a fundamental concept in the field of geophysics, particularly in the study of the Earth's subsurface. It is the process by which seismic waves, or vibrations, travel through the Earth's layers, providing valuable information about the properties of these layers. This chapter will introduce the basic principles of seismic wave propagation, including the types of seismic waves, their behavior in different media, and the factors that affect their propagation.

Seismic waves are generated by sudden releases of energy, such as earthquakes or man-made explosions. These waves travel through the Earth's layers, each layer affecting the wave in a unique way. The properties of these layers, such as their density and elasticity, determine how the waves behave. By studying the behavior of these waves, we can gain insights into the properties of the Earth's layers.

In this chapter, we will also discuss the mathematical models used to describe seismic wave propagation. These models, expressed in terms of differential equations, allow us to predict the behavior of seismic waves as they travel through the Earth's layers. We will also explore the techniques used to measure and record seismic waves, such as seismometers and seismographs.

Understanding seismic wave propagation is crucial in many areas of geophysics, including mineral exploration, hydrocarbon exploration, and earthquake studies. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of the basic principles of seismic wave propagation and its importance in the field of geophysics.




### Section 1.1 Seismic wave equations:

Seismic waves are elastic waves that propagate in solid or fluid materials. They can be divided into "body waves" that travel through the interior of the materials; "surface waves" that travel along surfaces or interfaces between materials; and "normal modes", a form of standing wave.

#### 1.1a Wave types: P-waves, S-waves, surface waves

There are two types of body waves, pressure waves or primary waves (P-waves) and shear or secondary waves (S-waves). P-waves are longitudinal waves that involve compression and expansion in the direction that the wave is moving and are always the first waves to appear on a seismogram as they are the fastest moving waves through solids. S-waves are transverse waves that move perpendicular to the direction of propagation. S-waves are slower than P-waves. Therefore, they appear later than P-waves on a seismogram. Fluids cannot support transverse elastic waves because of their low shear strength, so S-waves only travel in solids.

Surface waves are the result of P- and S-waves interacting with the surface of the Earth. These waves are dispersive, meaning that different frequencies have different velocities. The two main surface wave types are Rayleigh waves, which have both compressional and shear motions, and Love waves, which are purely shear. Rayleigh waves result from the interaction of P-waves and vertically polarized S-waves with the surface and can exist in any solid medium. Love waves are formed by horizontally polarized S-waves interacting with the surface, and can only exist if there is a change in the elastic properties with depth in a solid medium, which is always the case in seismological applications. Surface waves travel more slowly than P-waves and S-waves because they are the result of these waves traveling along indirect paths to interact with Earth's surface. Because they travel along the surface of the Earth, their energy decays less rapidly than body waves (1/distance<sup>2</sup> vs. 1/distance<sup>3</sup> for surface waves).

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical models used to describe these seismic waves, including the wave equations for P-waves, S-waves, and surface waves.

#### 1.1b Wave propagation in different media

The propagation of seismic waves is influenced by the properties of the medium through which they travel. These properties include the density, elasticity, and temperature of the medium. In this section, we will explore how these properties affect the propagation of P-waves, S-waves, and surface waves.

P-waves and S-waves propagate through the interior of the medium, while surface waves travel along the surface or interfaces between materials. The propagation of these waves can be described by the wave equations, which relate the wave's velocity, wavelength, and frequency to the properties of the medium.

In solids, P-waves and S-waves propagate at velocities that are determined by the elastic properties of the medium. The velocity of P-waves is typically higher than that of S-waves due to their longitudinal motion. The velocity of surface waves, on the other hand, is determined by the properties of the surface or interface at which they travel.

In fluids, P-waves and S-waves cannot propagate due to the lack of shear strength. However, surface waves can still propagate along the surface of the fluid. The velocity of these surface waves is determined by the properties of the surface, such as its roughness and density.

In the case of the Earth's mantle, the properties of the medium can vary with depth. This can lead to changes in the velocity of seismic waves, which can be observed in seismic data. For example, the velocity of P-waves in the Earth's mantle increases with depth, while the velocity of S-waves decreases with depth.

In the next section, we will explore how these variations in wave velocity can be used to image the Earth's subsurface.

#### 1.1c Wave reflection and refraction

The interaction of seismic waves with the boundaries between different media is a crucial aspect of seismic wave propagation. This interaction can result in the reflection or refraction of the waves, which can provide valuable information about the properties of the media.

When a seismic wave encounters a boundary between two media, part of the wave is reflected back into the first medium, and part is refracted into the second medium. The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. The law of refraction, also known as Snell's law, describes how the velocity of the wave changes as it crosses the boundary. Snell's law can be expressed as:

$$
n_1 \sin(\theta_1) = n_2 \sin(\theta_2)
$$

where $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the velocities of the wave in the first and second media, respectively, and $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are the angles of incidence and refraction, respectively.

The reflection and refraction of seismic waves can be used to image the Earth's subsurface. By analyzing the reflected and refracted waves, geophysicists can determine the properties of the media, such as their density and elasticity. This technique, known as seismic reflection, is widely used in the exploration of oil and gas resources.

In the next section, we will explore how these principles can be applied to the imaging of the Earth's subsurface.

#### 1.1d Wave attenuation

The propagation of seismic waves is not perfect, and some of the wave energy is lost as the wave travels through the medium. This loss of energy is known as wave attenuation. The attenuation of seismic waves is a complex process that depends on the properties of the medium and the frequency of the wave.

The attenuation of seismic waves can be described by the Q factor, which is defined as the ratio of the wave's energy to the energy lost per cycle. The Q factor is inversely proportional to the attenuation, so a higher Q factor indicates less attenuation. The Q factor can be expressed as:

$$
Q = \frac{2\pi f}{\alpha}
$$

where $f$ is the frequency of the wave and $\alpha$ is the attenuation coefficient.

The attenuation of seismic waves can be caused by various mechanisms, including scattering, absorption, and conversion to other types of waves. In solids, the attenuation is typically caused by scattering, which is the process by which the wave energy is scattered in different directions. In fluids, the attenuation is typically caused by absorption, which is the process by which the wave energy is converted into heat.

The attenuation of seismic waves can be a significant factor in the interpretation of seismic data. For example, the attenuation of P-waves can affect the accuracy of the velocity models derived from seismic reflection data. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of wave attenuation is crucial for the accurate interpretation of seismic data.

In the next section, we will explore how the principles of wave propagation, reflection, and refraction can be applied to the imaging of the Earth's subsurface.




### Section 1.1b Wave propagation in different media: solids, liquids, gases

In the previous section, we discussed the different types of seismic waves and their properties. Now, we will delve into how these waves propagate in different media, namely solids, liquids, and gases.

#### 1.1b.1 Wave Propagation in Solids

In solids, seismic waves can propagate as body waves or surface waves. As we have already discussed, body waves can be P-waves or S-waves. P-waves travel faster than S-waves in solids due to their longitudinal nature. S-waves, on the other hand, travel slower due to their transverse nature.

Surface waves, on the other hand, are the result of P-waves and S-waves interacting with the surface of the solid. These waves are dispersive, meaning that different frequencies have different velocities. The two main surface wave types are Rayleigh waves and Love waves.

#### 1.1b.2 Wave Propagation in Liquids

In liquids, P-waves and S-waves can also propagate. However, the behavior of these waves is different from that in solids. P-waves in liquids travel slower than in solids due to the lower shear strength of liquids. S-waves, on the other hand, cannot propagate in liquids as they require a shear component to travel.

Surface waves in liquids are also different from those in solids. The only type of surface wave that can propagate in liquids is the Lamb wave, which is a combination of P-waves and S-waves. Lamb waves are used in non-destructive testing of structures and are an important tool in the field of geophysics.

#### 1.1b.3 Wave Propagation in Gases

In gases, P-waves and S-waves cannot propagate. This is because gases have a very low density and cannot support the compressional and shear motions that are necessary for these waves to travel. However, in the ionosphere, which is a region of the upper atmosphere where free electrons and ions exist, P-waves can propagate. These waves are used in radio communication and are an important tool in the study of the ionosphere.

In the next section, we will discuss the equations that govern the propagation of these waves in different media. These equations, known as the wave equations, are fundamental to the study of seismic wave propagation.




### Section 1.1c Wave interactions: scattering, diffraction, attenuation

In the previous sections, we have discussed the propagation of seismic waves in different media. However, in real-world scenarios, these waves do not travel in a vacuum. They interact with various objects and structures, leading to phenomena such as scattering, diffraction, and attenuation. In this section, we will explore these phenomena in more detail.

#### 1.1c.1 Scattering

Scattering occurs when a wave encounters an object or a structure that is not homogeneous with the medium it is propagating in. The wave is then reflected or refracted in different directions, leading to a change in the wave's path. The amount of scattering depends on the size and shape of the object, as well as the wavelength of the wave.

For example, in the context of seismic waves, if a P-wave encounters a rock layer with a different density or velocity than the surrounding medium, it will be scattered in different directions. This can be useful in geophysical imaging, as the scattered waves can provide information about the subsurface structure.

#### 1.1c.2 Diffraction

Diffraction occurs when a wave encounters an obstacle or a boundary between two different media. The wave is then bent around the obstacle or the boundary, leading to a change in its direction. The amount of diffraction depends on the wavelength of the wave and the size of the obstacle or the boundary.

In the context of seismic waves, if a P-wave encounters a fault or a boundary between two different rock layers, it will be diffracted in different directions. This can be useful in geophysical imaging, as the diffracted waves can provide information about the subsurface structure.

#### 1.1c.3 Attenuation

Attenuation occurs when a wave loses energy as it propagates through a medium. This can be due to various factors, such as absorption, scattering, and diffraction. The amount of attenuation depends on the properties of the medium, as well as the frequency and the wavelength of the wave.

In the context of seismic waves, attenuation can be caused by the absorption of energy by the medium, as well as by the scattering and diffraction of the wave. This can be a significant factor in geophysical imaging, as it can affect the quality of the images produced.

In the next section, we will discuss how these phenomena can be modeled and analyzed using mathematical equations.

### One space dimension

#### Reflection and transmission at the boundary of two media

For an incident wave traveling from one medium (where the wave speed is `c_1`) to another medium (where the wave speed is `c_2`), one part of the wave will transmit into the second medium, while another part reflects back into the other direction and stays in the first medium. The amplitude of the transmitted wave and the reflected wave can be calculated by using the continuity condition at the boundary.

Consider the component of the incident wave with an angular frequency of `ω`, which has the waveform
$$u^\text{inc}(x, t) = Ae^{i(k_1 x - \omega t)},\quad A \in \C.$$
At `x = 0`, the incident reaches the boundary between the two media. Therefore, the corresponding reflected wave and the transmitted wave will have the waveforms
$$u^\text{refl}(x, t) = Be^{i(-k_1 x - \omega t)}, \quad
$$
$$u^\text{trans}(x, t) = Ce^{i(k_2 x - \omega t)}, \quad$$
where `B` and `C` are complex amplitudes. The continuity condition at the boundary is
$$u^\text{inc}(0, t) + u^\text{refl}(0, t) = u^\text{trans}(0, t), \quad
$$
This gives the equations
$$A + B = C, \quad
$$
and we have the reflectivity and transmissivity
$$
\frac{B}{A} = \frac{c_2 - c_1}{c_2 + c_1}, \quad
$$
When `ω = 0`, the reflected wave has a reflection phase change of 180°, since `k_1 = 0`. The energy conservation can be verified by
$$
\frac{B^2}{c_1} + \frac{C^2}{c_2} = \frac{A^2}{c_1}.
$$
The above discussion holds true for any component, regardless of its angular frequency of `ω`.

The limiting case of `c_1 = 0` corresponds to a "fixed end" that doesn't move, whereas the limiting case of `c_1 = \infty` corresponds to a "free end".

#### The Sturm–Liouville formulation

A flexible string that is stretched between two points `x = 0` and `x = L` and satisfies the wave equation for `0 < x < L`. On the boundary points, `u` may satisfy a variety of boundary conditions. A general form that is appropriate for applications is

$$
\frac{d}{dx} \left( p(x) \frac{du}{dx} \right) + q(x) u = 0, \quad
$$
where `p(x)` and `q(x)` are real-valued functions of `x`. This is known as the Sturm–Liouville formulation. The solutions to this equation are known as the Sturm–Liouville eigenfunctions, and the corresponding eigenvalues are given by
$$
\lambda_n = \frac{1}{L^2} \int_0^L q(x) \phi_n(x) \phi_m(x) dx, \quad
$$
where `$\phi_n(x)$` and `$\phi_m(x)$` are the Sturm–Liouville eigenfunctions corresponding to the eigenvalues `$\lambda_n$` and `$\lambda_m$`, respectively. The Sturm–Liouville eigenfunctions form a complete set of orthonormal functions, and any solution to the Sturm–Liouville formulation can be written as a linear combination of the Sturm–Liouville eigenfunctions.

In the context of seismic waves, attenuation can occur due to absorption by the medium, scattering off of inhomogeneities, and diffraction around obstacles. This can be a significant factor in the interpretation of seismic data, as it can affect the amplitude and phase of the received signals.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of near-surface geophysical imaging. This field of study is crucial in understanding the Earth's subsurface structure and properties, which are often hidden from view. The near-surface problems we will explore in this chapter are of great importance in various fields, including geology, environmental science, and engineering.

The near-surface of the Earth is a complex and dynamic environment, where the interaction of various physical processes can significantly influence the properties of the subsurface. These processes include weathering, erosion, and sedimentation, which can alter the composition and structure of the Earth's crust. Understanding these processes is crucial in predicting the behavior of the subsurface and its response to external forces.

We will begin by discussing the basic principles of near-surface geophysical imaging, including the use of various geophysical techniques such as seismic reflection, electromagnetic, and gravity surveys. These techniques provide valuable information about the subsurface, but they also come with their own set of challenges and limitations. We will explore these challenges and how they can be addressed in the context of near-surface problems.

Next, we will delve into the specific problems of land and shallow marine environments. These environments present unique challenges due to their different physical characteristics and the processes that act upon them. For example, in land environments, the effects of weathering and erosion can significantly alter the subsurface, while in shallow marine environments, the influence of tides and currents can be significant.

Finally, we will discuss the applications of near-surface geophysical imaging in various fields. This includes the exploration of mineral resources, the assessment of groundwater resources, and the prediction of seismic hazards. We will also touch upon the role of near-surface geophysical imaging in environmental studies, such as the assessment of soil and groundwater contamination.

In conclusion, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of near-surface geophysical imaging, with a focus on the specific problems and applications in land and shallow marine environments. By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the principles and techniques used in near-surface geophysical imaging, as well as the challenges and applications in land and shallow marine environments.




### Subsection: 2.1a Near-surface geological complexities and their impact on imaging

The near-surface of the Earth is a complex and dynamic environment, where the interaction of various physical processes can significantly influence the properties of the subsurface. These processes include weathering, erosion, and sedimentation, which can alter the composition and structure of the Earth's crust. Understanding these processes is crucial in predicting the behavior of the subsurface and its response to external forces.

#### 2.1a Near-surface geological complexities and their impact on imaging

The near-surface geological complexities can have a significant impact on geophysical imaging. These complexities can be broadly categorized into two types: lithological and structural.

##### Lithological Complexities

Lithological complexities refer to the variations in the composition of the Earth's crust. The Earth's crust is not uniform in composition, and it can vary significantly in different regions. For example, the crust under the oceans is typically thinner and more dense than the crust under the continents. This variation in composition can significantly affect the response of the subsurface to geophysical techniques.

For instance, seismic reflection, a common geophysical technique, relies on the difference in seismic velocity between different rock types. If the composition of the subsurface changes significantly, the seismic velocity can also change, leading to variations in the seismic reflection signal. This can make it difficult to interpret the subsurface structure accurately.

##### Structural Complexities

Structural complexities refer to the variations in the structure of the Earth's crust. The Earth's crust can be folded, faulted, and fractured, which can significantly alter its properties. These structural complexities can also affect the response of the subsurface to geophysical techniques.

For example, in the case of a fault, the offset in the rock layers can cause a change in the seismic velocity, leading to a change in the seismic reflection signal. This can make it difficult to interpret the subsurface structure accurately.

In conclusion, the near-surface geological complexities can have a significant impact on geophysical imaging. Understanding these complexities is crucial in predicting the behavior of the subsurface and its response to external forces. In the following sections, we will explore the specific problems of land and shallow marine environments, and how these complexities can be addressed.




### Subsection: 2.1b Analysis of dispersive and non-dispersive surface waves

Surface waves are a crucial tool in near-surface geophysical imaging. They provide valuable information about the subsurface properties, including the elastic parameters and the velocity structure. However, the interpretation of surface waves can be challenging due to their dispersive nature.

#### 2.1b Analysis of dispersive and non-dispersive surface waves

Surface waves can be broadly classified into two types: dispersive and non-dispersive. Dispersive surface waves are those whose velocity depends on the wavelength, while non-dispersive surface waves have a constant velocity regardless of the wavelength.

##### Dispersive Surface Waves

Dispersive surface waves are characterized by their ability to penetrate to different depths depending on their wavelength. This property is a result of the variation of velocities with wavelength, as shown in Figure 2. The longer wavelengths tend to travel faster than the shorter wavelengths, which allows them to penetrate deeper into the subsurface.

The dispersion of surface waves can be quantified using the group velocity and the phase velocity. The group velocity is the speed at which a wave group travels, while the phase velocity is the speed at which an individual wave travels. Both velocities increase with wavelength, which is a key factor in the dispersion of surface waves.

The dispersion of surface waves can be exploited to infer critical information about the subsurface. For instance, the variation of velocities with wavelength can be used to estimate the elastic parameters of the subsurface. This is possible because the velocity of surface waves is directly related to the elastic properties of the medium they are traveling through.

##### Non-Dispersive Surface Waves

Non-dispersive surface waves, on the other hand, have a constant velocity regardless of the wavelength. This makes them ideal for imaging shallow structures, where the wavelengths are typically small. However, non-dispersive surface waves are less sensitive to the subsurface properties compared to dispersive surface waves.

In conclusion, the analysis of dispersive and non-dispersive surface waves is crucial in near-surface geophysical imaging. While dispersive surface waves provide more detailed information about the subsurface, non-dispersive surface waves are more suitable for imaging shallow structures. Understanding the properties and behavior of these waves is essential for accurate interpretation of geophysical data.




### Subsection: 2.1c Geophone and hydrophone array design and deployment

The design and deployment of geophone and hydrophone arrays are crucial steps in the process of near-surface geophysical imaging. These arrays are designed to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio and minimize the influence of surface waves on recorded data.

#### 2.1c Geophone and hydrophone array design and deployment

##### Geophone Arrays

Geophone arrays are typically used in land acquisition to monitor the particle velocity in a certain orientation. The design of these arrays involves careful consideration of the number of components, their orientation, and the spacing between them.

The number of components in a geophone array refers to the number of geophones used. A single-component geophone is designed to record p-waves, while a multi-component geophone is designed to record p-waves and s-waves. The choice between these depends on the specific requirements of the imaging task.

The orientation of the geophones in the array is also important. The orientation of the geophones determines the direction in which the particle velocity is being monitored. This is crucial for accurately imaging the subsurface.

The spacing between geophones in the array is another key factor. The spacing between geophones affects the coverage of the array and the resolution of the recorded data. A larger spacing between geophones can provide better coverage, but it can also lead to lower resolution. Conversely, a smaller spacing can provide higher resolution, but it may not cover as large an area.

##### Hydrophone Arrays

Hydrophone arrays are typically used in marine seismic acquisition. The design of these arrays involves similar considerations to those for geophone arrays, but with some additional factors to consider.

One additional factor is the depth of the hydrophones. The depth of the hydrophones can affect the sensitivity of the array to different frequencies of the seismic signal. Deeper hydrophones can be more sensitive to lower frequencies, while shallower hydrophones can be more sensitive to higher frequencies.

Another factor is the orientation of the hydrophones. In marine acquisition, the hydrophones are often oriented vertically, with the hydrophone axis pointing towards the surface. This orientation can help to minimize the influence of surface waves on recorded data.

The deployment of geophone and hydrophone arrays involves careful planning and execution. The arrays must be deployed in a way that ensures maximum coverage of the area of interest, while minimizing the influence of noise and surface waves. This often involves careful consideration of the placement of the arrays, the orientation of the geophones and hydrophones, and the spacing between them.




#### 2.1d Signal processing techniques for noise reduction

Noise reduction is a critical aspect of near-surface geophysical imaging. It involves the removal or reduction of unwanted noise from the recorded data. This is necessary because noise can obscure the desired signal and make it difficult to interpret the data accurately.

##### Signal Processing Techniques for Noise Reduction

Signal processing techniques are used to reduce noise in near-surface geophysical imaging. These techniques can be broadly classified into two categories: spectral and parametric based approaches.

Spectral based approaches use the frequency content of the signal to identify and remove noise. One such approach is the use of the Line Integral Convolution (LIC) technique. This technique has been applied to a wide range of problems since it was first published in 1993. It involves the integration of a function along a curve or path in the frequency domain, which can help to reduce noise in the signal.

Parametric based approaches, on the other hand, use a model of the signal to identify and remove noise. One such approach is the use of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The EKF is a recursive estimator that can be used to estimate the state of a system based on noisy measurements. It can be particularly useful in near-surface geophysical imaging, where the signal may be corrupted by noise.

##### Advantages and Disadvantages of Signal Processing Techniques

Each of these signal processing techniques has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. The LIC technique, for example, is computationally efficient and can handle complex geometries. However, it can also be sensitive to the choice of the path or curve along which the integration is performed.

The EKF, on the other hand, can handle non-linear systems and can provide a probabilistic estimate of the signal. However, it can also be computationally intensive and may not be suitable for real-time applications.

##### Implementation of Signal Processing Techniques

The implementation of these signal processing techniques can be challenging due to the high computation requirements demanded by some of the estimation techniques. However, advances in digital signal processing and digital signal processing systems have made it possible to implement these techniques in real-time.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of these signal processing techniques in near-surface geophysical imaging.

## Chapter 3: Refraction traveltime interpretation:

### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we discussed the basics of seismic traveltime and its interpretation. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic of refraction traveltime interpretation. Refraction traveltime is a crucial aspect of near-surface geophysical imaging, as it allows us to understand the properties of the subsurface and the presence of any anomalies.

In this chapter, we will cover the various topics related to refraction traveltime interpretation. We will start by discussing the basics of refraction traveltime and its relationship with seismic traveltime. We will then move on to more advanced topics such as the interpretation of refraction traveltime curves and the use of velocity models in refraction traveltime interpretation.

Furthermore, we will also explore the different types of refraction traveltime curves and their significance in near-surface geophysical imaging. We will also discuss the limitations and challenges of refraction traveltime interpretation and how to overcome them.

Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of refraction traveltime interpretation and its importance in near-surface geophysical imaging. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid foundation in refraction traveltime interpretation and be able to apply it in their own geophysical studies. So let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of refraction traveltime interpretation.




### Section 3.1 Traveltime curves:

Traveltime curves are an essential tool in the interpretation of refraction traveltime. They provide a visual representation of the traveltime of seismic waves as they propagate through the subsurface. In this section, we will discuss the calculation and interpretation of traveltime curves.

#### 3.1a Calculation and interpretation of traveltime curves

Traveltime curves are calculated using the equation:

$$
T(x) = \int_{z=0}^{z=z(x)} \frac{1}{v(z)} dz
$$

where $T(x)$ is the traveltime, $z(x)$ is the depth at a given horizontal distance $x$, and $v(z)$ is the velocity at a given depth $z$. This equation is based on the assumption that the velocity is constant with depth, which is often a good approximation for near-surface geophysical imaging.

The interpretation of traveltime curves involves analyzing the shape and characteristics of the curve. The traveltime curve is typically a smooth, curved line, with the depth increasing towards the right. The slope of the curve represents the velocity of the subsurface, with a steeper slope indicating a higher velocity.

One of the key features of traveltime curves is the presence of breaks or discontinuities. These breaks can indicate the presence of subsurface anomalies, such as changes in velocity or the presence of interfaces between different layers. By analyzing the location and shape of these breaks, geophysicists can gain valuable information about the subsurface.

Another important aspect of traveltime curves is the presence of hyperbolic curves. These curves occur when the velocity of the subsurface changes abruptly, causing a change in the traveltime. Hyperbolic curves can indicate the presence of subsurface structures, such as faults or fractures.

In addition to analyzing the shape of traveltime curves, geophysicists also use velocity models to interpret them. A velocity model is a mathematical representation of the velocity of the subsurface as a function of depth. By using a velocity model, geophysicists can better understand the behavior of the traveltime curve and make more accurate interpretations.

However, it is important to note that traveltime curves can also be affected by other factors, such as the presence of noise or errors in the data. Therefore, it is crucial for geophysicists to carefully analyze and validate their traveltime curves before making any interpretations.

In conclusion, traveltime curves are a powerful tool in the interpretation of refraction traveltime. By understanding the calculation and interpretation of these curves, geophysicists can gain valuable insights into the properties of the subsurface and the presence of any anomalies. 





### Section 3.1b Building velocity models for near-surface imaging

In order to accurately interpret traveltime curves, geophysicists must have a good understanding of the velocity of the subsurface. This is where velocity models come into play. A velocity model is a mathematical representation of the velocity of the subsurface as a function of depth. It is used to interpret traveltime curves and to predict the traveltime of seismic waves in the subsurface.

There are several methods for building velocity models, including:

- **Direct measurement:** This method involves directly measuring the velocity of the subsurface at different depths. This can be done using various techniques, such as seismic refraction, seismic reflection, or electrical resistivity.
- **Indirect estimation:** This method involves estimating the velocity of the subsurface based on other data, such as surface geology, well logs, or remote sensing data.
- **Inversion:** This method involves using traveltime curves to estimate the velocity of the subsurface. This is done by inverting the traveltime curves to find the velocity model that best fits the data.

Once a velocity model is built, it can be used to interpret traveltime curves and to predict the traveltime of seismic waves in the subsurface. This is done by using the velocity model to calculate the traveltime of seismic waves at different depths. The resulting traveltime curve can then be compared to the observed traveltime curve to identify any discrepancies or anomalies.

It is important to note that velocity models are not perfect representations of the subsurface. They are based on assumptions and simplifications, and therefore may not accurately represent the true velocity of the subsurface. Therefore, it is important for geophysicists to continuously update and refine their velocity models as more data becomes available.

In the next section, we will discuss the different types of velocity models and their applications in near-surface geophysical imaging.





### Subsection 3.1c Statics correction methods for refraction data

In the previous section, we discussed the importance of velocity models in interpreting traveltime curves. However, even with a well-built velocity model, there may be discrepancies between the observed traveltime curve and the predicted traveltime curve. This is where statics correction methods come into play.

Statics correction methods are used to correct for errors in the observed traveltime curve that are not accounted for by the velocity model. These errors can arise from various sources, such as instrument errors, environmental conditions, or errors in the velocity model itself.

There are several methods for performing statics correction, including:

- **Time-distance method:** This method involves comparing the observed traveltime curve to a predicted traveltime curve at different distances. By adjusting the predicted traveltime curve to match the observed curve at different distances, the statics correction can be determined.
- **Eikonal equation method:** This method involves solving the eikonal equation, which describes the relationship between the traveltime of a seismic wave and its velocity. By solving the eikonal equation for different depths, the statics correction can be determined.
- **Inversion method:** This method involves inverting the observed traveltime curve to find the velocity model that best fits the data. By adjusting the velocity model to account for the statics correction, the observed traveltime curve can be matched.

It is important to note that statics correction methods are not perfect and may not be able to account for all errors in the observed traveltime curve. Therefore, it is important for geophysicists to continuously monitor and update their velocity models and statics correction methods to improve the accuracy of their interpretations.

In the next section, we will discuss the different types of velocity models and their applications in near-surface imaging.

## Chapter: Near-Surface Geophysical Imaging Textbook

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the concept of seismic interferometry, a powerful technique used in near-surface geophysical imaging. Seismic interferometry is a method of analyzing seismic data to extract information about the subsurface structure. It is based on the principle of interference, where two or more seismic waves interact with each other to produce a resultant wave. By studying the interference patterns, we can gain insights into the properties of the subsurface, such as the presence of boundaries, anisotropy, and heterogeneity.

The use of seismic interferometry has become increasingly popular in the field of geophysics due to its ability to provide high-resolution images of the subsurface.

### Subsection 3.1d Techniques for redatuming seismic data to different depths

In the previous section, we discussed the importance of velocity models and statics correction methods in interpreting traveltime curves. However, even with a well-built velocity model and accurate statics correction, there may be instances where it is necessary to redatum seismic data to different depths. This is where redatuming techniques come into play.

Redatuming is the process of adjusting the depth of seismic data to match a desired depth level. This can be useful in cases where the data was collected at different depths, or when it is necessary to compare data from different depths.

There are several techniques for redatuming seismic data, including:

- **Depth conversion:** This technique involves converting the depth of the data to a desired depth level. This can be done using the velocity model and the traveltime curve, or by manually adjusting the depth values.
- **Interpolation:** This technique involves interpolating the data from one depth level to another. This can be done using various mathematical methods, such as linear or polynomial interpolation.
- **Resampling:** This technique involves resampling the data at a different depth level. This can be done using various methods, such as nearest neighbor resampling or bilinear interpolation.
- **Filtering:** This technique involves filtering the data to remove unwanted noise or artifacts. This can be done using various filtering methods, such as low-pass or high-pass filtering.

It is important to note that redatuming techniques are not perfect and may introduce errors or distortions in the data. Therefore, it is important for geophysicists to carefully consider the depth conversion method and to validate the results using other techniques or data.

In the next section, we will discuss the different types of velocity models and their applications in near-surface imaging.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the concept of first-arrival traveltime tomography, a powerful tool used in near-surface geophysical imaging. This technique allows us to create a 3D image of the subsurface by analyzing the travel time of the first arrivals of seismic waves. By understanding the principles behind first-arrival traveltime tomography, we can gain valuable insights into the structure and properties of the subsurface, which is crucial for a wide range of applications, from oil and gas exploration to groundwater mapping.

### Section 4.1 Traveltime picking:

Traveltime picking is a crucial step in first-arrival traveltime tomography. It involves the identification and measurement of the first arrivals of seismic waves at different locations on the surface. This section will discuss the principles and techniques used for traveltime picking.

#### 4.1a Manual and automated traveltime picking techniques

Traveltime picking can be done manually or automatically. Manual traveltime picking involves visually inspecting the seismic data and identifying the first arrivals by hand. This technique is time-consuming and requires a high level of expertise, but it allows for more control and flexibility.

On the other hand, automated traveltime picking techniques use algorithms to identify the first arrivals. These techniques can be more efficient and less prone to human error, but they also require careful calibration and validation.

One commonly used automated technique is the "picking by threshold" method, which involves setting a threshold on the amplitude of the seismic data and identifying the first arrivals as the first peaks above the threshold. This method can be effective for simple data sets, but it may not work well for more complex data with multiple arrivals or noise.

Another approach is the "picking by template matching" method, which involves creating a template of the expected first arrival signal and matching it to the received signal. This method can be more robust to noise and multiple arrivals, but it requires a good understanding of the expected signal and may not work well for complex data sets.

In addition to these techniques, there are also more advanced methods that use machine learning and artificial intelligence to automatically identify and pick the first arrivals. These methods can be highly effective, but they require large amounts of training data and careful calibration.

Overall, the choice between manual and automated traveltime picking techniques depends on the specific data set and the level of expertise available. In practice, a combination of both methods may be used to achieve the best results.

### Subsection 4.1b Challenges and limitations of traveltime picking

Despite the advancements in traveltime picking techniques, there are still some challenges and limitations that need to be addressed. One of the main challenges is the presence of noise in the seismic data. Noise can make it difficult to accurately identify and pick the first arrivals, leading to errors in the travel time measurements.

Another limitation is the complexity of the data. In some cases, the first arrivals may not be the strongest peaks in the data, making it difficult to identify them using traditional methods. Additionally, the presence of multiple arrivals or reflections can also complicate the travel time picking process.

Furthermore, the accuracy of travel time picking can also be affected by the quality of the seismic data. Poor data quality can lead to errors in the travel time measurements, which can then affect the accuracy of the resulting tomographic image.

To address these challenges and limitations, researchers are constantly developing new techniques and algorithms to improve the accuracy and efficiency of travel time picking. These include the use of advanced signal processing methods, such as wavelet transforms and spectral analysis, as well as the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques.

In conclusion, travel time picking is a crucial step in first-arrival traveltime tomography. While there are still some challenges and limitations, advancements in technology and techniques continue to improve the accuracy and efficiency of this process. 





### Subsection 4.1b Iterative and non-iterative tomographic inversion algorithms

Once the first arrivals have been picked, the next step in first-arrival traveltime tomography is to invert the traveltime data to create a velocity model of the subsurface. This is typically done using iterative or non-iterative inversion algorithms.

#### 4.1b.1 Iterative Inversion Algorithms

Iterative inversion algorithms are a class of methods that iteratively adjust the velocity model to minimize the difference between the observed and calculated traveltimes. These methods are particularly useful for complex velocity structures, as they can handle non-uniform grids and non-linear velocity variations.

One of the most commonly used iterative inversion algorithms is the Gauss-Seidel method, which iteratively updates the velocity model by adjusting one parameter at a time. This method is simple and efficient, but it may not always converge to a solution.

Another popular iterative method is the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, which uses a combination of gradient descent and Newton's method to minimize the traveltime residuals. This method is more robust than the Gauss-Seidel method, but it requires more computational resources.

#### 4.1b.2 Non-Iterative Inversion Algorithms

Non-iterative inversion algorithms, on the other hand, solve the inversion problem directly without the need for iteration. These methods are typically based on linear or quadratic programming techniques and can handle large-scale problems with many parameters.

One of the most commonly used non-iterative methods is the simplex method, which solves the inversion problem as a linear programming problem. This method is efficient and robust, but it may not always find the global optimum.

Another popular non-iterative method is the trust region method, which uses a combination of gradient descent and Newton's method to solve the inversion problem as a quadratic programming problem. This method is more robust than the simplex method, but it requires more computational resources.

#### 4.1b.3 Comparison of Iterative and Non-Iterative Methods

Both iterative and non-iterative inversion algorithms have their strengths and weaknesses. Iterative methods are more flexible and can handle complex velocity structures, but they may not always converge to a solution. Non-iterative methods, on the other hand, can handle large-scale problems and can find the global optimum, but they may not always be efficient.

In practice, a combination of both types of methods is often used to create a robust and accurate velocity model. The choice between iterative and non-iterative methods depends on the specific characteristics of the data and the velocity structure.




### Subsection 4.1c Assessing resolution and uncertainty of tomographic models

Once the velocity model has been inverted, it is important to assess the resolution and uncertainty of the model. This is crucial for understanding the limitations of the model and for interpreting the results.

#### 4.1c.1 Resolution of Tomographic Models

The resolution of a tomographic model refers to the smallest feature that can be detected in the model. In other words, it is the smallest change in velocity that can be resolved by the model. The resolution of a tomographic model is determined by the spacing of the traveltime data and the method used for traveltime picking.

The resolution can be improved by increasing the density of the traveltime data and by using more sophisticated traveltime picking methods. However, there is always a trade-off between resolution and uncertainty, as increasing the resolution can increase the uncertainty of the model.

#### 4.1c.2 Uncertainty of Tomographic Models

The uncertainty of a tomographic model refers to the variability in the model due to random errors in the data and the inversion process. The uncertainty can be quantified by the confidence intervals of the model parameters or by the standard deviation of the model.

The uncertainty of a tomographic model can be reduced by increasing the density of the traveltime data and by using more robust inversion methods. However, there is always a trade-off between uncertainty and resolution, as reducing the uncertainty can decrease the resolution of the model.

#### 4.1c.3 Assessing Resolution and Uncertainty

The resolution and uncertainty of a tomographic model can be assessed by comparing the model with independent data or by performing sensitivity analyses. For example, the resolution can be assessed by comparing the model with high-resolution data from other sources, such as seismic reflection data. The uncertainty can be assessed by performing sensitivity analyses, where the model is perturbed by small changes in the data or the inversion parameters and the effect on the model is observed.

In conclusion, assessing the resolution and uncertainty of tomographic models is crucial for understanding the limitations of the model and for interpreting the results. It requires careful consideration of the data, the inversion method, and the interpretation of the results.

## Chapter: Chapter 5: Migration techniques

### Introduction

In the realm of geophysics, migration techniques play a pivotal role in the interpretation of subsurface structures. This chapter, "Migration Techniques," delves into the intricacies of these techniques, providing a comprehensive understanding of their principles, applications, and limitations.

Migration techniques are mathematical methods used to enhance the quality of seismic data. They are employed to correct for the effects of wave propagation and to improve the resolution of subsurface images. The process of migration involves the transformation of a seismic image from the time domain to the depth domain, thereby providing a more accurate representation of the subsurface.

The chapter begins by introducing the concept of migration and its importance in geophysical imaging. It then proceeds to discuss the different types of migration techniques, including prestack migration, poststack migration, and finite-difference migration. Each technique is explained in detail, with a focus on their underlying principles and practical applications.

The chapter also explores the challenges and limitations of migration techniques. It discusses the trade-offs between resolution and noise, and the impact of these factors on the quality of the migrated image. Furthermore, it delves into the role of migration in the interpretation of complex geological structures, such as faults and horizons.

Throughout the chapter, mathematical expressions are used to illustrate the principles of migration techniques. These are formatted using the TeX and LaTeX style syntax, rendered using the MathJax library. For example, inline math is written as `$y_j(n)$` and equations as `$$\Delta w = ...$$`.

### Subsection 4.1d Integrating geological information for model interpretation

The integration of geological information is a crucial step in the interpretation of tomographic models. This process involves the use of geological knowledge and data to interpret the results of the tomographic model. It is important to note that the interpretation of tomographic models is not solely based on the model results, but also on the understanding of the geological context in which the model is applied.

#### 4.1d.1 Geological Knowledge and Data

Geological knowledge and data are essential for the interpretation of tomographic models. This includes information about the geological structure of the area, the properties of the rocks, and the processes that have shaped the Earth's surface. This information can be obtained from various sources, such as field observations, remote sensing data, and geological maps.

Geological knowledge and data can be used to constrain the interpretation of tomographic models. For example, if the model results suggest a high velocity anomaly in an area where a geological fault is known to exist, this can be interpreted as the fault being filled with dense rocks. Similarly, if the model results suggest a low velocity anomaly in an area where a geological layer of sedimentary rocks is known to exist, this can be interpreted as the sedimentary rocks being more porous and less dense than the surrounding rocks.

#### 4.1d.2 Integrating Geological Information

The integration of geological information with tomographic models involves the use of various techniques and tools. These include the use of geological databases, geological modeling software, and geostatistical methods.

Geological databases contain information about the geological structure of an area, including information about geological faults, layers, and mineral deposits. These databases can be used to visualize the geological structure of an area and to identify areas of interest for tomographic modeling.

Geological modeling software can be used to create 3D models of the geological structure of an area. These models can be used to visualize the results of tomographic models and to interpret the model results in the context of the geological structure.

Geostatistical methods can be used to interpolate geological data and to create maps of geological properties. These methods can be used to estimate the properties of rocks in areas where direct measurements are not available, and to identify areas of interest for tomographic modeling.

#### 4.1d.3 Interpreting Tomographic Models

The interpretation of tomographic models involves the use of various techniques and tools. These include the use of velocity models, traveltime tomography, and seismic imaging.

Velocity models are used to estimate the velocity of seismic waves in the subsurface. These models can be used to interpret the results of tomographic models and to estimate the properties of rocks in the subsurface.

Traveltime tomography is used to estimate the traveltime of seismic waves from a source to a receiver. This information can be used to create a velocity model and to interpret the results of tomographic models.

Seismic imaging is used to create images of the subsurface based on the traveltime of seismic waves. These images can be used to interpret the results of tomographic models and to identify areas of interest for further investigation.

In conclusion, the integration of geological information is a crucial step in the interpretation of tomographic models. This process involves the use of geological knowledge and data, as well as various techniques and tools. By integrating geological information with tomographic models, we can gain a deeper understanding of the Earth's subsurface and its properties.

### Section: 5.1 Kirchhoff migration:

Kirchhoff migration is a powerful method used in geophysical imaging to migrate seismic data. It is based on the principles of Kirchhoff's theory of migration, which states that the migration of a seismic event can be calculated by integrating the seismic field over the surface of the event. This theory is the basis for many migration methods, including Kirchhoff migration.

#### 5.1a Principles and algorithms of Kirchhoff migration

The Kirchhoff migration method is based on the principle of superposition, which states that the migration of a seismic event can be calculated by summing the migrations of all individual events that contribute to the event. This principle is used in the Kirchhoff migration algorithm to calculate the migration of a seismic event.

The Kirchhoff migration algorithm begins by dividing the seismic event into smaller events, known as subevents. Each subevent is then migrated using the Kirchhoff migration method. The migrations of all subevents are then summed to obtain the migration of the original event.

The Kirchhoff migration method is based on the assumption that the seismic event is a plane wave. This assumption is often valid for near-surface geophysical imaging, where the subsurface is relatively homogeneous and the seismic event is not too deep. However, for more complex geological structures, other migration methods may be more appropriate.

The Kirchhoff migration method is implemented using a variety of algorithms, including the line integral convolution (LIC) algorithm and the fast wavelet transform algorithm. These algorithms are used to efficiently calculate the migration of the seismic event.

The LIC algorithm is based on the principle of line integral convolution, which states that the migration of a seismic event can be calculated by integrating the seismic field along a line. This algorithm is particularly useful for calculating the migration of a seismic event in two dimensions.

The fast wavelet transform algorithm is based on the principle of fast wavelet transforms, which allows for the efficient calculation of the migration of a seismic event. This algorithm is particularly useful for calculating the migration of a seismic event in three dimensions.

In conclusion, the Kirchhoff migration method is a powerful tool for migrating seismic data in near-surface geophysical imaging. It is based on the principles of Kirchhoff's theory of migration and is implemented using a variety of algorithms, including the LIC algorithm and the fast wavelet transform algorithm. These algorithms allow for the efficient calculation of the migration of a seismic event, making Kirchhoff migration a valuable tool for geophysical imaging.

#### 5.1b.1 Common-Offset Data

Common-offset data refers to seismic data collected with the same offset (distance from the source). This type of data is commonly used in geophysical imaging, as it allows for the creation of high-resolution images of the subsurface.

#### 5.1b.2 Kirchhoff Migration of Common-Offset Data

The Kirchhoff migration method can be applied to common-offset data by dividing the data into smaller subevents and migrating each subevent using the Kirchhoff migration method. The migrations of all subevents are then summed to obtain the migration of the original event.

The Kirchhoff migration method is particularly useful for common-offset data, as it can accurately account for the effects of dipping reflectors. This is because the method is based on the principle of superposition, which allows for the calculation of the migration of a seismic event by summing the migrations of all individual events that contribute to the event.

#### 5.1b.3 Comparison with Other Migration Approaches

While the Kirchhoff migration method is a powerful tool for imaging common-offset data, it is not the only approach available. Other migration methods, such as the finite-difference method and the finite-element method, can also be used to migrate common-offset data.

The finite-difference method is based on the principle of approximating the effects of the subsurface by a finite set of points. This method is particularly useful for complex geological structures, as it can accurately account for the effects of dipping reflectors and other complex geological features.

The finite-element method, on the other hand, is based on the principle of dividing the subsurface into a finite set of elements and solving for the effects of each element. This method is particularly useful for large-scale imaging problems, as it allows for the efficient calculation of the migration of the subsurface.

#### 5.1b.4 Conclusion

In conclusion, the Kirchhoff migration method is a powerful tool for imaging common-offset data. It is particularly useful for accurately accounting for the effects of dipping reflectors and can be used in conjunction with other migration approaches for more complex geological structures. By understanding the principles and algorithms behind these migration methods, geophysicists can effectively image the subsurface and gain valuable insights into the Earth's structure.

The reverse-time migration method is particularly useful for imaging complex near-surface structures, as it can accurately account for the effects of dipping reflectors and other complex geological features. This is because the method is based on the principle of superposition, which allows for the calculation of the migration of a seismic event by summing the migrations of all individual events that contribute to the event.

#### 5.1c.2 Implementation of Reverse-Time Migration

The implementation of reverse-time migration involves solving the reverse-time wave equation, which is a second-order partial differential equation. This can be done using various numerical methods, such as the finite-difference method or the finite-element method.

The finite-difference method is particularly useful for implementing reverse-time migration, as it allows for the accurate approximation of the effects of the subsurface by a finite set of points. This method is particularly useful for complex geological structures, as it can accurately account for the effects of dipping reflectors and other complex geological features.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the concept of early-arrival waveform tomography, a powerful technique used in near-surface geophysical imaging. This method allows us to create high-resolution images of the subsurface, providing valuable information about the Earth's structure and composition. By analyzing the arrival times and waveforms of early-arriving signals, we can construct detailed images of the subsurface, providing insights into the properties of the Earth's crust and upper mantle.

Early-arrival waveform tomography is a relatively new technique, but it has already proven to be a valuable tool in geophysical research. It has been used to study a wide range of geological structures, from small-scale faults and fractures to large-scale crustal and mantle anomalies. By combining this method with other geophysical techniques, such as seismic reflection and gravity surveys, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the Earth's near-surface structure.

In this chapter, we will begin by discussing the basic principles of early-arrival waveform tomography, including the concept of wave propagation and the properties of early-arriving signals. We will then delve into the mathematical techniques used to analyze these signals, such as waveform matching and cross-correlation. We will also explore the various factors that can affect the accuracy and reliability of early-arrival waveform tomography, such as noise and signal distortion.

### Section: 6.1 Waveform modeling:

Waveform modeling is a crucial aspect of early-arrival waveform tomography. It involves the use of mathematical models to simulate the behavior of seismic waves as they propagate through the Earth's near-surface. This section will provide an introduction to waveform modeling, discussing the basic principles and techniques used in this process.

#### 6.1a Forward modeling of seismic waveforms in near-surface media

Forward modeling is a technique used to predict the behavior of seismic waves as they propagate through the Earth's near-surface. This is achieved by using mathematical models that describe the physical properties of the medium through which the waves are traveling. These models can be used to simulate the arrival times and waveforms of early-arriving signals, providing valuable information about the subsurface structure.

One of the key principles behind forward modeling is the concept of wave propagation. Seismic waves travel through the Earth's near-surface by interacting with the physical properties of the medium, such as its density and elasticity. These interactions can cause the waves to change direction, speed, and amplitude, leading to the complex waveforms observed at the surface.

The process of forward modeling involves solving the wave equation, a mathematical representation of the physical laws governing wave propagation. This equation describes how the wave's amplitude, phase, and direction change as it travels through the medium. By solving this equation, we can predict the behavior of the wave at any point in the medium, allowing us to simulate the arrival times and waveforms of early-arriving signals.

In the context of early-arrival waveform tomography, forward modeling is used to create benchmark data for the inverse filtering process. This involves using the forward filter method equation (1.7) and the Kramer-Krönig relation to create a forward Q-filtering solution. This solution is then used to create benchmark data for the inverse filtering process, providing a reference point for the analysis of early-arriving signals.

In addition to the forward filter method, other techniques can also be used for forward modeling, such as the finite-difference method and the finite element method. These methods involve discretizing the medium into a grid of points and solving the wave equation at each point. This allows for a more detailed and accurate representation of the medium, but also requires more computational resources.

In conclusion, forward modeling is a crucial aspect of early-arrival waveform tomography. It allows us to simulate the behavior of seismic waves as they propagate through the Earth's near-surface, providing valuable information about the subsurface structure. By using mathematical models and techniques such as the forward filter method and the finite-difference method, we can create accurate predictions of early-arriving signals, aiding in the interpretation of geophysical data.

Now, we will delve into the inverse problem formulation and solution methods for waveform inversion. This is a crucial step in the process of early-arrival waveform tomography, as it allows us to determine the physical properties of the subsurface based on the observed waveforms.

The inverse problem in waveform inversion involves determining the physical properties of the medium based on the observed waveforms. This is a challenging task, as the waveforms are influenced by a multitude of factors, including the properties of the medium, the source of the waves, and the receiver at the surface. To solve this problem, we use the method of least squares, which minimizes the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed and predicted waveforms.

The least squares method involves solving the following equation:

$$
\min_{\mathbf{p}} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{p}) - \mathbf{F}_i \right)^2
$$

where $\mathbf{p}$ is the vector of unknown physical properties, $\mathbf{F}(\mathbf{p})$ is the forward model of the waveforms, and $\mathbf{F}_i$ is the observed waveform at the $i$th receiver.

The solution to this equation is given by the normal equations:

$$
\mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{A} \mathbf{p} = \mathbf{A}^T \mathbf{F}_i
$$

where $\mathbf{A}$ is the Jacobian matrix of the forward model, and $\mathbf{F}_i$ is the vector of observed waveforms.

The least squares method is a powerful tool for solving the inverse problem in waveform inversion. However, it is important to note that the solution is only as good as the forward model and the observed waveforms. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully validate the forward model and to ensure that the observed waveforms are accurate and reliable.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the challenges and limitations of waveform inversion, and how these can be addressed to improve the accuracy and reliability of the results.

### Section: 7.1 Surface wave analysis techniques:

Surface waves are a crucial tool in geophysical imaging, providing valuable information about the subsurface properties of the Earth. In this section, we will explore the various techniques used for analyzing surface waves, including dispersion-curve inversion methods.

#### 7.1a Analysis of dispersion in surface wave data

Dispersion is a fundamental concept in geophysics, referring to the way in which surface waves spread out as they travel across the surface of the Earth. This phenomenon is crucial for understanding the subsurface properties of the Earth, as different wavelengths of surface waves penetrate to different depths.

The dispersion of surface waves can be analyzed using dispersion-curve inversion methods. These methods involve plotting the amplitude of surface waves against depth for different wavelengths, and then using mathematical models to interpret the resulting dispersion curves. This process allows us to infer critical information about the subsurface, such as the elastic properties of the Earth's materials.

The usefulness of surface waves in determining subsurface elastic properties arises from the way in which they disperse. As surface waves travel across the surface of the Earth, they spread out due to the variation of velocities with wavelength. This phenomenon is illustrated by Figure 2, which shows the amplitude of surface waves against depth for two different wavelengths. Both waves have the same total energy, but the longer wavelength has its energy spread out over a larger interval.

The increase in speed with wavelength is seen for both group velocities and phase velocities. A wave group consists of waves at varying wavelengths and frequencies, and individual waves of a wave group travel at different speeds. This is due to the fact that a wave group is made up of infinite frequency content in phase at one point, and if each frequency travels at the same speed, the peak of the wave group will remain intact. However, if each frequency travels at a different speed, the peak will disperse, leading to the phenomenon of dispersion.

In order to accurately interpret the dispersion curves produced by surface waves, it is important to consider the various factors that can affect the accuracy of the inversion process. These include noise and model assumptions, which can introduce errors in the interpretation of the dispersion curves.

In conclusion, the analysis of dispersion in surface wave data is a crucial aspect of geophysical imaging. By using dispersion-curve inversion methods, we can gain valuable insights into the subsurface properties of the Earth, helping us to better understand the processes that shape our planet. 





### Subsection: 7.1b Separation and characterization of Love and Rayleigh waves

In the previous section, we discussed the dispersion of surface waves and how it can be analyzed using dispersion-curve inversion methods. In this section, we will focus on the separation and characterization of Love and Rayleigh waves, which are two types of surface waves that play a crucial role in geophysical imaging.

#### 7.1b.1 Separation of Love and Rayleigh Waves

Love and Rayleigh waves are two types of surface waves that travel along the surface of the Earth. They are both transverse waves, meaning that the particle motion is perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. However, they differ in their polarization and propagation characteristics.

Love waves have a longitudinal polarization, meaning that the particle motion is parallel to the direction of wave propagation. They also have a horizontal motion, with the particles moving in a circular motion around a vertical axis. Love waves are slower than Rayleigh waves and have a longer wavelength.

On the other hand, Rayleigh waves have a retrograde elliptical motion, meaning that the particle motion is parallel to the direction of wave propagation, but with a circular motion around a horizontal axis. Rayleigh waves are faster than Love waves and have a shorter wavelength.

The separation of Love and Rayleigh waves is crucial for understanding the subsurface properties of the Earth. This is because they have different velocities and wavelengths, which allows us to infer information about the subsurface at different depths.

#### 7.1b.2 Characterization of Love and Rayleigh Waves

The characterization of Love and Rayleigh waves involves analyzing their dispersion curves. As mentioned earlier, the dispersion of surface waves can be analyzed using dispersion-curve inversion methods. These methods involve plotting the amplitude of surface waves against depth for different wavelengths, and then using mathematical models to interpret the resulting dispersion curves.

The dispersion curves of Love and Rayleigh waves are different, with Love waves having a longer wavelength and slower velocity compared to Rayleigh waves. This difference in dispersion allows us to separate the two types of waves and analyze them separately.

In addition to their dispersion curves, Love and Rayleigh waves also have different polarization characteristics. Love waves have a longitudinal polarization, while Rayleigh waves have a retrograde elliptical polarization. This difference in polarization can also be used to separate the two types of waves.

In conclusion, the separation and characterization of Love and Rayleigh waves are crucial for understanding the subsurface properties of the Earth. By analyzing their dispersion curves and polarization characteristics, we can infer valuable information about the subsurface and gain a better understanding of the Earth's structure. 





### Subsection: 7.1c Estimation of phase velocities from dispersion curves

In the previous section, we discussed the dispersion of surface waves and how it can be analyzed using dispersion-curve inversion methods. In this section, we will focus on the estimation of phase velocities from dispersion curves.

#### 7.1c.1 Estimation of Phase Velocities

Phase velocity is a crucial parameter in geophysical imaging as it provides information about the subsurface properties at different depths. It is defined as the velocity at which the phase of a wave propagates through a medium. In the case of surface waves, the phase velocity is determined by the dispersion curve.

The phase velocity of a surface wave can be estimated by analyzing its dispersion curve. The dispersion curve is a plot of the amplitude of the surface wave against depth for different wavelengths. By analyzing the shape of the dispersion curve, we can determine the phase velocity of the surface wave.

#### 7.1c.2 Methods for Estimating Phase Velocities

There are several methods for estimating phase velocities from dispersion curves. One of the most commonly used methods is the least squares curve fitting program, which was first proposed by Dorman and Ewing (1962). This method uses an iterative technique to find the best-fit parameters for the dispersion curve.

Another method for estimating phase velocities is Knopoff's method, which simplifies the equations used in surface wave data inversion. This method is faster than the least squares curve fitting program, but it requires input parameters such as shear wave velocity, compressional wave velocity, and density values.

#### 7.1c.3 Direct Search Algorithm

A more recent method for estimating phase velocities is the direct search algorithm, which was first proposed by Wathelet et al. (2004). This method creates a theoretical dispersion curve by guessing parameters such as shear wave velocity, compressional wave velocity, and density values. The algorithm then matches the theoretical dispersion curve to the experimental data, providing an estimate of the phase velocity.

In conclusion, the estimation of phase velocities from dispersion curves is a crucial aspect of geophysical imaging. By analyzing the dispersion curve, we can determine the phase velocity of surface waves and gain valuable information about the subsurface properties. Various methods, such as the least squares curve fitting program, Knopoff's method, and the direct search algorithm, can be used to estimate phase velocities from dispersion curves.

One way to integrate surface wave data with other seismic methods is through the use of dispersion-curve inversion methods. These methods allow us to invert surface wave data and obtain information about the subsurface properties, such as shear wave velocity, density, and thickness. By combining this information with data obtained from other seismic methods, we can create a more complete image of the subsurface.

#### 7.1d.2 Advantages of Integrating Surface Wave Data

Secondly, it can help to reduce uncertainties in the data. By integrating surface wave data with other seismic methods, we can cross-check the results and reduce the likelihood of errors.

Lastly, it can help to improve the resolution of the data. By combining different types of data, we can obtain a more complete picture of the subsurface, which can improve the resolution of the data.

#### 7.1d.3 Challenges of Integrating Surface Wave Data

Despite its advantages, integrating surface wave data with other seismic methods also presents some challenges. One of the main challenges is the complexity of the data. Surface wave data can be complex and difficult to interpret, especially when combined with other types of data.

Another challenge is the need for advanced techniques and software. Integrating surface wave data with other seismic methods requires advanced techniques and software, which can be expensive and time-consuming to obtain and use.

#### 7.1d.4 Future Directions

In the future, advancements in technology and software will make it easier to integrate surface wave data with other seismic methods. With the development of new techniques and software, the complexity of the data can be reduced, making it easier to interpret and analyze.

Furthermore, advancements in computing power will allow for faster and more efficient data processing, making it easier to integrate surface wave data with other seismic methods.

In conclusion, integrating surface wave data with other seismic methods is crucial for obtaining a more complete understanding of the subsurface. While it presents some challenges, the benefits of integrating data far outweigh the difficulties. With advancements in technology and software, the integration of surface wave data will become even more valuable in geophysical imaging.

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have discussed various techniques and methods for imaging the near-surface geophysical data. However, these techniques often encounter challenges due to the presence of short-wavelength residual statics. These residual statics can significantly affect the accuracy and reliability of the imaging results. In this chapter, we will delve into the topic of short-wavelength residual statics corrections, which is a crucial aspect of near-surface geophysical imaging.

Short-wavelength residual statics refer to the small-scale variations in the Earth's gravitational field and magnetic field that are not accounted for in the imaging process. These variations can arise from various sources, such as topographic irregularities, subsurface inhomogeneities, and instrument errors. The presence of these residual statics can lead to errors in the imaging results, making it necessary to correct for them.

In this chapter, we will explore the different methods and techniques used for short-wavelength residual statics corrections. We will discuss the principles behind these corrections and how they are applied in practice. We will also cover the challenges and limitations of these corrections and how to overcome them. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of short-wavelength residual statics corrections and their importance in near-surface geophysical imaging.




### Section: 8.1 Statics corrections for near-surface layers:

In the previous chapters, we have discussed various techniques and methods for imaging the near-surface geophysical data. However, these techniques often encounter challenges due to the presence of short-wavelength residual statics. These residual statics can significantly affect the accuracy and reliability of the imaging results. In this section, we will delve into the topic of statics corrections for near-surface layers, which is a crucial aspect of near-surface geophysical imaging.

#### 8.1a Methods for correcting static shifts in near-surface layers

Short-wavelength residual statics refer to the small-scale variations in the Earth's gravitational field and magnetic field that are not accounted for in the imaging process. These variations can arise from various sources, such as topographic irregularities, subsurface inhomogeneities, and instrument errors. The presence of these residual statics can lead to errors in the imaging results, making it necessary to correct for them.

One of the most commonly used methods for correcting static shifts in near-surface layers is the Gauss-Seidel method. This method is an iterative technique used to solve a system of linear equations. In the context of geophysical imaging, the Gauss-Seidel method is used to correct for static shifts by adjusting the unknown parameters until the residual statics are minimized.

Another method for correcting static shifts is the use of critical state soil mechanics. This method is based on the concept of critical state, which is the state at which a soil or rock sample exhibits maximum strength and minimum deformation. By understanding the critical state of the near-surface layers, we can correct for static shifts by adjusting the unknown parameters to match the critical state conditions.

In addition to these methods, there are also other techniques for correcting static shifts, such as the use of plane stress and plane strain states of stress. These methods involve dividing the stress matrix into distortional and volumetric parts, which can help in correcting for static shifts.

It is important to note that these methods are not without limitations. The accuracy of the corrections depends on the accuracy of the input data and the assumptions made in the correction process. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider the limitations and uncertainties associated with each method before applying them to near-surface geophysical imaging.

In the next section, we will discuss the challenges and limitations of statics corrections for near-surface layers and how to overcome them. 





### Subsection: 8.1b Principles and applications of ray tracing in near-surface imaging

Ray tracing is a powerful technique used in near-surface geophysical imaging to accurately represent the Earth's surface and subsurface structures. It is based on the principle of tracing rays from the observer's eye to the surface or subsurface structures, and determining the color and shading of the structures based on their material properties and the effects of lights in the scene.

The idea behind ray tracing is to trace rays from the eye, one per pixel, and find the closest object blocking the path of that ray. This is then the object the eye sees through that pixel. Using the material properties and the effect of the lights in the scene, the algorithm can determine the shading of this object. The simplifying assumption is made that if a surface faces a light, the light will reach that surface and not be blocked or in shadow. The shading of the surface is computed using traditional 3D computer graphics shading models.

One of the main advantages of ray tracing is its ability to easily deal with non-planar surfaces and solids, such as cones and spheres. This makes it a valuable tool in near-surface imaging, where the Earth's surface and subsurface structures are often complex and non-planar.

Ray tracing has a wide range of applications in near-surface imaging. It is commonly used in seismic imaging to accurately represent the Earth's subsurface structures. It is also used in gravity and magnetic field imaging to correct for short-wavelength residual statics. Additionally, ray tracing is used in remote sensing techniques, such as radar and satellite imaging, to accurately represent the Earth's surface and subsurface structures.

In conclusion, ray tracing is a powerful and versatile technique used in near-surface geophysical imaging. Its ability to accurately represent complex and non-planar structures makes it an essential tool for understanding the Earth's surface and subsurface.

### Subsection: 8.1c Addressing time shifts and amplitude variations in seismic data

In the previous section, we discussed the principles and applications of ray tracing in near-surface imaging. In this section, we will focus on the specific application of ray tracing in addressing time shifts and amplitude variations in seismic data.

Seismic data is a crucial tool in near-surface geophysical imaging. It provides valuable information about the Earth's subsurface structures, including their location, shape, and material properties. However, seismic data is often affected by time shifts and amplitude variations, which can distort the true image of the subsurface structures.

Time shifts occur when the seismic waves travel through different layers of the Earth's subsurface, each with a different velocity. This results in a delay or advancement of the wave arrival time at the receiver, leading to a time shift in the recorded data. Amplitude variations, on the other hand, occur when the seismic waves interact with the subsurface structures, causing changes in their amplitude. This can be due to reflections, refractions, or scattering of the waves.

To accurately interpret seismic data, it is essential to correct for these time shifts and amplitude variations. This is where ray tracing comes into play. By tracing rays from the source to the receiver, ray tracing can accurately determine the travel time and amplitude of the seismic waves, taking into account the effects of the subsurface structures.

One of the key advantages of ray tracing in addressing time shifts and amplitude variations is its ability to handle complex subsurface structures. As mentioned earlier, ray tracing can easily deal with non-planar surfaces and solids, making it a powerful tool for correcting for the effects of these structures on seismic data.

In addition to correcting for time shifts and amplitude variations, ray tracing can also be used to enhance the quality of seismic data. By tracing rays from the source to the receiver, ray tracing can determine the direction of the seismic waves, allowing for the removal of noise and unwanted signals. This can greatly improve the clarity and interpretability of the seismic data.

In conclusion, ray tracing is a powerful tool in addressing time shifts and amplitude variations in seismic data. Its ability to accurately determine the travel time and amplitude of seismic waves, as well as its ability to handle complex subsurface structures, make it an essential technique in near-surface geophysical imaging.

### Subsection: 8.1d Techniques for quality control and validation of processed data

In the previous sections, we have discussed the principles and applications of ray tracing in near-surface imaging, including its use in addressing time shifts and amplitude variations in seismic data. However, it is equally important to ensure the quality and validity of the processed data. In this section, we will explore various techniques for quality control and validation of processed data.

#### Data Validation

Data validation is a crucial step in the processing of geophysical data. It involves checking the data for errors, inconsistencies, and outliers. This is particularly important in near-surface imaging, where the data is often affected by noise and other disturbances.

One common technique for data validation is the use of statistical methods. These methods involve analyzing the data for patterns and trends, and comparing them to expected values. For example, in seismic data, the arrival times of the seismic waves can be compared to the expected arrival times based on the known velocities of the subsurface layers. Any significant deviations from these expected values can indicate errors in the data.

Another technique for data validation is the use of visual inspection. This involves visually examining the data for any anomalies or outliers. For example, in seismic data, the amplitude of the seismic waves can be visually inspected for any unexpected variations. This can help identify errors in the data that may not be detected by statistical methods.

#### Quality Control

Quality control is a continuous process that involves monitoring and improving the quality of the processed data. This is particularly important in near-surface imaging, where the data is often affected by changing conditions and disturbances.

One technique for quality control is the use of reference data. This involves comparing the processed data to reference data that is known to be accurate. For example, in seismic data, the arrival times of the seismic waves can be compared to reference data from well-known structures. Any significant deviations from the reference data can indicate errors in the processed data.

Another technique for quality control is the use of sensitivity analysis. This involves studying the effect of changes in the input data on the output data. For example, in seismic data, the sensitivity of the arrival times to changes in the subsurface velocities can be studied. This can help identify areas of the data that are particularly sensitive to errors, and guide efforts for improving the quality of the data.

In conclusion, quality control and validation of processed data is a crucial step in near-surface imaging. It involves a combination of statistical methods, visual inspection, and continuous monitoring and improvement. By ensuring the quality and validity of the data, we can improve the accuracy and reliability of our near-surface imaging results.

## Chapter 9: Long-wavelength residual statics corrections




### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamentals of geophysical imaging, focusing on the principles of seismic statics corrections. These corrections are essential for accurately interpreting seismic data and understanding the subsurface structure. However, as we delve deeper into the field of geophysical imaging, it is important to understand that seismic statics corrections are just one aspect of the larger picture.

In this chapter, we will explore the concept of "Beyond seismic statics corrections". This chapter will not cover any specific topics, but rather provide a broad overview of the various aspects of geophysical imaging that go beyond seismic statics corrections. This includes topics such as electromagnetic imaging, gravity imaging, and magnetotelluric imaging, among others.

The goal of this chapter is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the different techniques and methods used in geophysical imaging. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the various tools and approaches available for imaging the near-surface geophysical environment.

As we delve into these topics, it is important to keep in mind that each technique has its own strengths and limitations. Therefore, it is crucial for geophysicists to have a well-rounded understanding of all these techniques in order to effectively interpret and analyze geophysical data.

In the following sections, we will provide a brief overview of each topic covered in this chapter, highlighting their key principles and applications. We hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource for students and professionals in the field of geophysics, providing them with a solid foundation for further exploration and research in this exciting field.




### Section: 9.1 Dynamic corrections for near-surface effects:

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamentals of geophysical imaging, focusing on the principles of seismic statics corrections. These corrections are essential for accurately interpreting seismic data and understanding the subsurface structure. However, as we delve deeper into the field of geophysical imaging, it is important to understand that seismic statics corrections are just one aspect of the larger picture.

In this section, we will explore the concept of dynamic corrections for near-surface effects. These corrections are necessary to account for the effects of the near-surface environment on seismic data. The near-surface environment is characterized by complex geological structures, such as faults, fractures, and layering, which can significantly affect the propagation of seismic waves.

#### 9.1a Correction of dynamic near-surface effects on seismic data

The dynamic correction of near-surface effects on seismic data involves the use of advanced imaging techniques that take into account the effects of the near-surface environment on seismic data. These techniques are necessary because the near-surface environment can significantly alter the propagation of seismic waves, leading to errors in the interpretation of seismic data.

One such technique is the use of seismic inverse Q filtering. This technique involves the computation of a forward Q-filtering solution, which is then integrated with the equation for the reference frequency (1.9). This solution is used to compensate for the effects of the near-surface environment on seismic data.

Another important aspect of dynamic corrections is the use of multidimensional seismic data processing. This involves the use of various techniques, such as deconvolution, to negate the effects of the near-surface environment on seismic data. Deconvolution is implemented as a convolution with an inverse filter, which helps to increase the resolution of the seismic data.

In addition to these techniques, there are also various well-known deconvolution techniques already available for one dimension, such as predictive deconvolution. These techniques can be extended to multidimensional data by using the concept of "effective source time" and "effective source time derivative". This allows for the implementation of one-dimensional deconvolution techniques in a multidimensional setting.

Overall, the use of dynamic corrections for near-surface effects is crucial for accurately interpreting seismic data and understanding the subsurface structure. These corrections take into account the complex geological structures of the near-surface environment, leading to more accurate and reliable interpretations. In the next section, we will explore the concept of dynamic corrections in more detail, focusing on the use of seismic inverse Q filtering and multidimensional seismic data processing.





### Section: 9.1b Suppression of multiples and ground roll in near-surface imaging

In addition to the dynamic corrections discussed in the previous section, there are also specific techniques for suppressing multiples and ground roll in near-surface imaging. Multiples are reflections that have been scattered by subsurface interfaces before reaching the surface, while ground roll is the direct arrival of the seismic wave at the surface. Both of these phenomena can significantly affect the quality of seismic data and must be accounted for in the imaging process.

#### 9.1b.1 Suppression of Multiples

Multiples can be suppressed using a variety of techniques, including migration and deconvolution. Migration involves the use of a velocity model to move the multiple reflections back to their true location, while deconvolution involves the use of an inverse filter to remove the effects of the multiple reflections.

One specific technique for suppressing multiples is the use of the multiple-surface-consistent imaging condition. This condition states that the multiple reflections must satisfy the same imaging condition as the primary reflections. This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{A_m}{v_m} \right) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{A_p}{v_p} \right)
$$

where $A_m$ and $v_m$ are the amplitude and velocity of the multiple reflections, and $A_p$ and $v_p$ are the amplitude and velocity of the primary reflections. This condition ensures that the multiple reflections are correctly imaged, reducing their impact on the final image.

#### 9.1b.2 Suppression of Ground Roll

Ground roll can be suppressed using a variety of techniques, including surface-consistent imaging and surface-consistent migration. Surface-consistent imaging involves the use of a velocity model to image the surface reflections, while surface-consistent migration involves the use of a velocity model to move the surface reflections back to their true location.

One specific technique for suppressing ground roll is the use of the surface-consistent imaging condition. This condition states that the surface reflections must satisfy the same imaging condition as the subsurface reflections. This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{A_s}{v_s} \right) = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{A_u}{v_u} \right)
$$

### Section: 10.1 Integration of seismic and non-seismic data:

In the previous chapters, we have discussed various geophysical imaging techniques and their applications in understanding the Earth's subsurface. However, these techniques are often used in isolation, providing a limited understanding of the subsurface. In this section, we will explore the concept of integration of seismic and non-seismic data, which combines multiple geophysical techniques to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the subsurface.

#### 10.1a Integration of seismic data with other geophysical data types for improved imaging

Seismic data is a powerful tool for imaging the Earth's subsurface, providing information about the velocity and density of the subsurface. However, it is limited in its ability to provide information about other important properties such as temperature, salinity, and magnetic fields. To overcome this limitation, seismic data can be integrated with other geophysical data types, such as electromagnetic, gravity, and magnetic data.

One of the key advantages of integrating seismic data with other geophysical data types is the ability to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the subsurface. By combining the information from different techniques, we can create a more detailed and accurate model of the subsurface, which can be used for various applications such as resource exploration, hazard assessment, and environmental studies.

One example of the integration of seismic data with other geophysical data types is the use of joint geophysical inversions. This approach involves the simultaneous inversion of data from multiple geophysical techniques, such as seismic, electromagnetic, and gravity data. By combining these techniques, we can create a more detailed and accurate model of the subsurface, which can be used for various applications such as resource exploration, hazard assessment, and environmental studies.

Another example is the use of seismic oceanography, which combines seismic data with other oceanographic data to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the ocean. This approach has been used to extract distributions of temperature, salinity, and other physical properties, providing valuable information for oceanographic research and resource exploration.

In addition to these examples, there are many other techniques for integrating seismic data with other geophysical data types, such as spectral analysis for vertical mixing rates and inverting for temperature and salinity. These techniques have been used in various applications, such as understanding ocean currents and mixing processes, and have proven to be valuable tools for studying the Earth's subsurface.

### Section: 10.1b Algorithms for joint inversion of multiple geophysical datasets

In the previous section, we discussed the integration of seismic data with other geophysical data types for improved imaging. In this section, we will delve deeper into the algorithms used for joint inversion of multiple geophysical datasets.

Joint inversion involves the simultaneous inversion of data from multiple geophysical techniques. This approach is particularly useful when the data from each technique is insufficient to fully constrain the subsurface model. By combining the data from different techniques, we can create a more detailed and accurate model of the subsurface.

One of the key challenges in joint inversion is the integration of data from different techniques. Each technique may have its own strengths and limitations, and the data may not be directly comparable. Therefore, it is necessary to develop algorithms that can effectively integrate the data and solve for the underlying subsurface model.

One such algorithm is the Gauss-Seidel method, which is commonly used in joint inversion. This method involves iteratively solving for the model parameters by minimizing the misfit between the observed data and the model predictions. The Gauss-Seidel method is particularly useful for large-scale problems, where the model parameters are interdependent and need to be solved simultaneously.

Another approach to joint inversion is the use of Bayesian inversion. This method involves incorporating prior knowledge about the subsurface model into the inversion process. The prior knowledge can be in the form of constraints on the model parameters or assumptions about the subsurface properties. Bayesian inversion can be particularly useful when dealing with noisy or incomplete data.

In addition to these methods, there are also various optimization techniques that can be used for joint inversion, such as gradient descent and genetic algorithms. These methods involve iteratively adjusting the model parameters to minimize the misfit between the observed data and the model predictions.

Overall, the choice of algorithm for joint inversion depends on the specific problem at hand and the available data. It is important to carefully consider the strengths and limitations of each algorithm and choose the most appropriate one for the given scenario.

### Subsection: 10.1c Techniques for regularization and optimization of joint inversion models

In the previous section, we discussed the integration of seismic data with other geophysical data types for improved imaging. We also introduced the concept of joint inversion, where data from multiple geophysical techniques are simultaneously inverted to create a more detailed and accurate subsurface model. However, the process of joint inversion can be challenging due to the large number of parameters involved and the potential for overfitting. In this section, we will discuss some techniques for regularization and optimization of joint inversion models.

#### Regularization Techniques

Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in models with a large number of parameters. It involves adding a penalty term to the objective function, which encourages the model parameters to remain within a certain range. This helps to prevent the model from overfitting to the data and improves its generalizability.

One common regularization technique used in joint inversion is the L1 regularization. This technique adds a penalty term to the objective function that is proportional to the sum of the absolute values of the model parameters. This helps to reduce the number of parameters that are significantly different from zero, thereby preventing overfitting.

Another regularization technique that is commonly used in joint inversion is the L2 regularization. This technique adds a penalty term to the objective function that is proportional to the sum of the squares of the model parameters. This helps to reduce the overall magnitude of the model parameters, thereby preventing overfitting.

#### Optimization Techniques

Optimization is a crucial aspect of joint inversion, as it involves finding the optimal values for the model parameters that minimize the misfit between the observed data and the model predictions. One common optimization technique used in joint inversion is the Gauss-Seidel method. This method involves iteratively solving for the model parameters by minimizing the misfit between the observed data and the model predictions. The Gauss-Seidel method is particularly useful for large-scale problems, where the model parameters are interdependent and need to be solved simultaneously.

Another optimization technique that is commonly used in joint inversion is the gradient descent method. This method involves iteratively adjusting the model parameters in the direction of steepest descent of the objective function. The gradient descent method is particularly useful for non-convex objective functions, where the Gauss-Seidel method may not converge.

#### Bayesian Inversion

Bayesian inversion is another approach to joint inversion that involves incorporating prior knowledge about the subsurface model into the inversion process. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with noisy or incomplete data, as it allows for the incorporation of prior constraints on the model parameters. Bayesian inversion can be performed using various techniques, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and variational Bayesian methods.

In conclusion, regularization and optimization techniques are crucial for the successful implementation of joint inversion. These techniques help to prevent overfitting and improve the generalizability of the model, while also allowing for the incorporation of prior knowledge and constraints. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, we can create more accurate and reliable joint inversion models.

In this section, we will discuss some strategies for successful near-surface imaging using joint inversion approaches. These strategies are crucial for obtaining accurate and reliable results from joint inversion techniques.

#### Data Quality and Quantity

The quality and quantity of data used in joint inversion play a crucial role in the success of the imaging process. High-quality data with minimal noise and errors can significantly improve the accuracy of the imaging results. Additionally, the quantity of data also matters, as more data can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the subsurface structure. Therefore, it is essential to collect high-quality data from various geophysical techniques to ensure successful near-surface imaging.

#### Model Complexity

The complexity of the model used in joint inversion can also impact the success of the imaging process. A model that is too simple may not be able to capture the complex subsurface structure, while a model that is too complex can lead to overfitting and poor generalizability. Therefore, it is crucial to strike a balance between model complexity and accuracy. This can be achieved by using regularization techniques, as discussed in the previous section.

#### Uncertainty Analysis

Uncertainty analysis is an essential aspect of joint inversion, as it helps to quantify the uncertainty in the imaging results. This can be achieved by performing sensitivity analysis, where the effect of changing the model parameters on the imaging results is evaluated. Additionally, uncertainty analysis can also be performed by using Monte Carlo simulations, where the imaging results are calculated multiple times with different sets of model parameters to estimate the range of possible values.

#### Model Validation

Model validation is a crucial step in the joint inversion process, as it helps to assess the accuracy of the imaging results. This can be achieved by comparing the imaging results with independent data, such as well logs or surface geophysical data. If the results do not match, it may indicate a problem with the model or the data used in the inversion process. Therefore, it is essential to validate the imaging results to ensure their accuracy.

In conclusion, successful near-surface imaging using joint inversion approaches requires careful consideration of data quality and quantity, model complexity, uncertainty analysis, and model validation. By following these strategies, accurate and reliable imaging results can be obtained, providing valuable insights into the subsurface structure.

Below are a few areas of data flows that may need perennial DQ checks:

- Completeness and precision DQ checks on all data may be performed at the source system.
- Data quality checks on the data lineage may be performed at the data integration tools.
- Data quality checks on the data profiling may be performed at the data warehouse.
- Data quality checks on the data usage may be performed at the data visualization tools.

In the next section, we will discuss the various techniques and methods used in data preprocessing, with a focus on near-surface applications.

#### 13.1b Data Resampling

Data resampling is a crucial step in the data preprocessing workflow. It involves the adjustment of the sampling rate of data, which is the rate at which data points are collected over time. This is necessary because different data sources may have different sampling rates, and it is important to standardize the data for further processing and analysis.

The process of data resampling involves two main steps: interpolation and decimation. Interpolation is the process of estimating data points between known data points. This is typically done using mathematical functions, such as linear or polynomial interpolation. Decimation, on the other hand, involves reducing the sampling rate of data by a factor. This is typically done by discarding every "N"th data point, where "N" is the decimation factor.

Data resampling is particularly important in geophysical imaging, as it allows for the integration of data from different sources with different sampling rates. This is crucial in near-surface applications, where data from various sensors and instruments may need to be combined for a more comprehensive understanding of the subsurface.

One of the key challenges in data resampling is the potential loss of information. When data is interpolated or decimated, some information may be lost. This can affect the accuracy and reliability of the results. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the resampling process and to use techniques that minimize information loss.

In the next section, we will discuss the various techniques and methods used in data resampling, with a focus on near-surface applications.

#### 13.1c Data Filtering

Data filtering is another crucial step in the data preprocessing workflow. It involves the removal of unwanted data points or noise from the data. This is necessary because noise can significantly affect the accuracy and reliability of the results.

The process of data filtering involves two main steps: smoothing and filtering. Smoothing is the process of reducing the roughness of data by replacing extreme data points with more moderate values. This is typically done using mathematical functions, such as a moving average or a low-pass filter. Filtering, on the other hand, involves the removal of specific frequencies or ranges of frequencies from the data. This is typically done using filters, such as a band-pass filter or a notch filter.

Data filtering is particularly important in geophysical imaging, as it allows for the removal of noise and other unwanted signals from the data. This is crucial in near-surface applications, where the data may be contaminated with noise from various sources, such as electrical interference or instrument noise.

One of the key challenges in data filtering is the potential loss of important data points. When data is smoothed or filtered, some data points may be removed or modified. This can affect the accuracy and reliability of the results. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the filtering process and to use techniques that minimize the loss of important data points.

In the next section, we will discuss the various techniques and methods used in data filtering, with a focus on near-surface applications.

#### 13.1d Data Interpolation

Data interpolation is a crucial step in the data preprocessing workflow. It involves the estimation of data points between known data points. This is necessary because different data sources may have different sampling rates, and it is important to standardize the data for further processing and analysis.

The process of data interpolation involves two main steps: linear interpolation and polynomial interpolation. Linear interpolation is the simplest form of interpolation and involves estimating a data point by connecting two known data points with a straight line. Polynomial interpolation, on the other hand, involves estimating a data point by fitting a polynomial curve to the known data points.

Data interpolation is particularly important in geophysical imaging, as it allows for the integration of data from different sources with different sampling rates. This is crucial in near-surface applications, where data from various sensors and instruments may need to be combined for a more comprehensive understanding of the subsurface.

One of the key challenges in data interpolation is the potential loss of information. When data is interpolated, some information may be lost. This can affect the accuracy and reliability of the results. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the interpolation process and to use techniques that minimize information loss.

In the next section, we will discuss the various techniques and methods used in data interpolation, with a focus on near-surface applications.

#### 13.1e Data Compression

Data compression is a crucial step in the data preprocessing workflow. It involves the reduction of the size of data without significantly affecting its quality. This is necessary because large datasets can be difficult to handle and process, and it is important to reduce their size for efficient storage and transmission.

The process of data compression involves two main steps: lossless compression and lossy compression. Lossless compression is a method of data compression in which the original data can be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data. This is typically achieved by removing redundancy and repetition from the data. Lossy compression, on the other hand, involves a loss of data in the compression process. This is typically achieved by discarding or simplifying certain aspects of the data.

Data compression is particularly important in geophysical imaging, as it allows for the efficient storage and transmission of large datasets. This is crucial in near-surface applications, where data from various sources may need to be combined and transmitted for further processing and analysis.

One of the key challenges in data compression is the trade-off between compression ratio and loss of data. Lossless compression methods typically have lower compression ratios, while lossy compression methods can achieve higher compression ratios but at the cost of losing some data. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the compression method used and to balance the need for compression with the need for data quality.

In the next section, we will discuss the various techniques and methods used in data compression, with a focus on near-surface applications.

#### 13.1f Data Visualization

Data visualization is a crucial step in the data preprocessing workflow. It involves the representation of data in a visual format, such as graphs, charts, or maps. This is necessary because visual representations can provide a more intuitive and understandable way of presenting complex data.

The process of data visualization involves two main steps: data exploration and data presentation. Data exploration involves the use of visualizations to gain insights into the data and to identify patterns or trends. Data presentation, on the other hand, involves the use of visualizations to communicate the results of data analysis to others.

Data visualization is particularly important in geophysical imaging, as it allows for the exploration and presentation of complex data in a more intuitive and understandable way. This is crucial in near-surface applications, where data from various sources may need to be integrated and presented for further analysis and interpretation.

One of the key challenges in data visualization is the choice of appropriate visualization techniques. Different types of data may require different types of visualizations, and it is important to choose the most effective and appropriate visualization for the data at hand.

In the next section, we will discuss the various techniques and methods used in data visualization, with a focus on near-surface applications.

## Chapter: Chapter 14: Seismic Data Analysis

### Introduction

Seismic data analysis is a crucial aspect of geophysical imaging, providing valuable insights into the Earth's subsurface structure. This chapter will delve into the various techniques and methodologies used in the analysis of seismic data, with a particular focus on near-surface applications.

The analysis of seismic data involves the interpretation of signals generated by seismic events, such as earthquakes or man-made vibrations. These signals are recorded by seismometers, which are sensitive instruments designed to detect and measure ground motion. The analysis of these signals can provide information about the Earth's interior structure, including the presence of geological features such as faults, boundaries, and layers.

In the context of near-surface applications, seismic data analysis is particularly important. Near-surface geophysical imaging involves the study of the Earth's surface and the shallow subsurface, typically to depths of a few hundred meters. This is a critical area of study, as it includes the uppermost layers of the Earth's crust, which are often of great interest to geologists and engineers.

This chapter will explore the principles and techniques used in the analysis of seismic data, with a focus on near-surface applications. We will discuss the various types of seismic data, the instruments used to record them, and the methodologies used to interpret them. We will also explore the challenges and limitations of seismic data analysis, and discuss how these can be addressed.

Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional in the field of geophysics, this chapter will provide you with a comprehensive understanding of seismic data analysis. It will equip you with the knowledge and skills needed to interpret seismic data, and to apply this knowledge in your own work.

<math>f(x)=1+x^{32}+x^{47}+x^{58}+x^{90}+x^{121}+x^{128}</math>

<math>g(x)=1+x^{32}+x^{37}+x^{72}+x^{102}+x^{128}+x^{44}x^{60}+x^{61}x^{125}+x^{63}x^{67}x^{69}x^{101}+x^{80}x^{88}+x^{110}x^{111}+x^{115}x^{117}+x^{46}x^{50}x^{58}+x^{103}x^{104}x^{106}+x^{33}x^{35}x^{36}x^{40}</math>

<math>h(x)=b_{i+12}s_{i+8}+s_{i+13}s_{i+20}+b_{i+95}s_{i+42}+s_{i+60}s_{i+79}+b_{i+12}b_{i+95}s_{i+94}</math>

In addition to the feedback polynomials, the update functions for the NLFSR and the LFSR are:

<math>b_{i+128}=s_i+b_{i}+b_{i+26}+b_{i+56}+b_{i+91}+b_{i+96}+b_{i+3}b_{i+67}+b_{i+11}b_{i+13}+b_{i+17}b_{i+18}+b_{i+27}b_{i+59}+b_{i+40}b_{i+48}+b_{i+61}b_{i+65}+b_{i+68}b_{i+84}+b_{i+88}b_{i+92}b_{i+93}b_{i+95}+b_{i+22}b_{i+24}b_{i+25}+b_{i+70}b_{i+78}b_{i+82}</math>

<math>s_{i+128}=s_i+s_{i+7}+s_{i+38}+s_{i+70}+s_{i+81}+s_{i+96}</math>

The pre-output stream (<math>y</math>) is defined as:

<math>y_i=h(x)+s_{i+93}+b_{i+2}+b_{i+15}+b_{i+36}+b_{i+45}+b_{i+64}+b_{i+73}+b_{i+89}</math>

### Initialisation

Upon initialisation we define an <math>IV</math> of 96 bit, where the <math>IV_0</math> dictates the mode of operation.

The LFSR is initialised as:

<math>s_i = IV_i</math> for <math>0 \leq i \leq 95</math>

<math>s_i = 1</math> for <math>96 \leq i \leq 126</math>

<math>s_{127} = 0</math>

The last 0 bit ensures that similar key-IV pairs "do not" produce shifted versions of each other.

The NLFSR is initialised by copying the entire 128 bit key (<math>k</math>) into the NLFSR.

### Section: 13.1c Deconvolution and Spectral Balancing

Deconvolution and spectral balancing are essential techniques in the processing of seismic data. These techniques are used to improve the quality of seismic data by reducing noise and enhancing the signal of interest. In this section, we will discuss the principles and applications of deconvolution and spectral balancing in seismic data processing.

#### Deconvolution

Deconvolution is a mathematical process that involves the removal of a known signal from a recorded signal. In seismic data processing, deconvolution is used to remove the effects of the instrument response from the recorded seismic signal. The instrument response is the response of the seismic instrument to a unit impulse. It is often a complex function that can distort the recorded signal. By deconvolving the recorded signal with the instrument response, we can recover the original signal.

The deconvolution process can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
x(t) = h(t) * y(t)
$$

where $x(t)$ is the recorded signal, $h(t)$ is the instrument response, and $y(t)$ is the original signal. The deconvolution process involves finding the inverse of the instrument response, $h^{-1}(t)$, and convolving it with the recorded signal, $x(t)$, to recover the original signal, $y(t)$.

Deconvolution is a powerful technique that can significantly improve the quality of seismic data. However, it is important to note that the success of deconvolution depends on the accuracy of the instrument response. If the instrument response is not known or is not accurately represented, the deconvolution process can introduce artifacts into the recovered signal.

#### Spectral Balancing

Spectral balancing is another important technique in seismic data processing. It involves adjusting the spectral content of the recorded signal to improve its quality. This is often necessary because the spectral content of the recorded signal can be distorted by the instrument response and other factors.

The spectral balancing process can be represented mathematically as follows:

$$
y(t) = x(t) * h(t)
$$

where $y(t)$ is the balanced signal, $x(t)$ is the recorded signal, and $h(t)$ is the instrument response. The spectral balancing process involves convolving the recorded signal with the inverse of the instrument response, $h^{-1}(t)$, to recover the original signal, $y(t)$.

Spectral balancing can be used to correct for the spectral distortion introduced by the instrument response. However, it is important to note that spectral balancing can also introduce noise into the recovered signal. Therefore, it is often used in conjunction with other techniques, such as deconvolution, to improve the quality of seismic data.

In the next section, we will discuss the practical applications of deconvolution and spectral balancing in seismic data processing.




#### 13.1d Statics and Dynamics Corrections

Statics and dynamics corrections are essential steps in the processing of seismic data. These corrections are necessary to account for the effects of the Earth's rotation and the motion of the seismic source and receiver. In this section, we will discuss the principles and applications of statics and dynamics corrections in seismic data processing.

##### Static Corrections

Static corrections are applied to account for the effects of the Earth's rotation on the recorded seismic signal. The Earth's rotation causes a deflection of the seismic rays, which can result in a distortion of the recorded signal. The amount of static correction depends on the distance between the seismic source and receiver, the depth of the source and receiver, and the azimuth of the seismic rays.

The static correction can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
\Delta t = \frac{1}{v} \cdot \frac{x \cdot \sin(\phi) \cdot \sin(\theta) + y \cdot \sin(\phi) \cdot \cos(\theta) + z \cdot \cos(\phi)}{1 - \frac{x \cdot \sin(\phi) \cdot \sin(\theta) + y \cdot \sin(\phi) \cdot \cos(\theta) + z \cdot \cos(\phi)}{v \cdot r}}
$$

where $\Delta t$ is the static correction, $v$ is the velocity of the seismic rays, $x$, $y$, and $z$ are the coordinates of the seismic source or receiver, $\phi$ is the latitude, and $\theta$ is the longitude.

##### Dynamics Corrections

Dynamics corrections are applied to account for the effects of the motion of the seismic source and receiver on the recorded seismic signal. The motion of the source and receiver can cause a time shift in the recorded signal, which can result in a distortion of the signal. The amount of dynamics correction depends on the velocity of the source and receiver, the time of the shot, and the azimuth of the seismic rays.

The dynamics correction can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
\Delta t = \frac{v \cdot t}{r}
$$

where $\Delta t$ is the dynamics correction, $v$ is the velocity of the source or receiver, $t$ is the time of the shot, and $r$ is the distance between the source and receiver.

In conclusion, statics and dynamics corrections are essential steps in the processing of seismic data. These corrections are necessary to account for the effects of the Earth's rotation and the motion of the seismic source and receiver on the recorded seismic signal. By applying these corrections, we can improve the quality of seismic data and enhance our understanding of the Earth's subsurface.

### Section: 14.1 Seismic Attributes:

Seismic data interpretation is a crucial aspect of geophysical imaging, as it allows us to understand the subsurface structure and properties of the Earth. In this section, we will discuss the various attributes of seismic data and how they can be interpreted to gain insights into the Earth's near-surface.

#### 14.1a Amplitude Attributes

Amplitude attributes are one of the most important aspects of seismic data interpretation. They provide information about the strength and intensity of seismic signals, which can be used to identify different types of materials and structures in the subsurface.

The amplitude of a seismic signal is directly related to the strength of the source that generated it. This means that stronger sources, such as large earthquakes, will produce larger amplitude signals. However, the amplitude of a signal can also be affected by other factors, such as the distance between the source and the receiver, the type of material the signal is passing through, and the presence of any obstacles in its path.

One of the most commonly used amplitude attributes is the amplitude of the signal itself. This can be measured in terms of its amplitude in the time domain, or its amplitude in the frequency domain. The amplitude in the time domain is a measure of the strength of the signal at a specific point in time, while the amplitude in the frequency domain is a measure of the strength of the signal at a specific frequency.

Another important amplitude attribute is the amplitude envelope, which is the overall amplitude of the signal over a period of time. This can be used to identify changes in the strength of the signal, which can be indicative of changes in the subsurface.

In addition to these attributes, there are also more advanced techniques for analyzing amplitude data, such as spectral analysis and time-frequency analysis. These techniques allow us to break down the amplitude data into its individual frequency components, and to analyze how the amplitude changes over time.

Overall, amplitude attributes are a crucial tool for interpreting seismic data and understanding the near-surface structure of the Earth. By analyzing the amplitude of seismic signals, we can gain valuable insights into the properties and composition of the subsurface.

Frequency attributes are another important aspect of seismic data interpretation. They provide information about the frequency content of seismic signals, which can be used to identify different types of materials and structures in the subsurface.

The frequency of a seismic signal is directly related to the speed of the source that generated it. This means that faster sources, such as small earthquakes, will produce higher frequency signals. However, the frequency of a signal can also be affected by other factors, such as the distance between the source and the receiver, the type of material the signal is passing through, and the presence of any obstacles in its path.

One of the most commonly used frequency attributes is the frequency of the signal itself. This can be measured in terms of its frequency in the time domain, or its frequency in the frequency domain.

#### 14.1c Polarity Attributes

Polarity attributes are a crucial aspect of seismic data interpretation. They provide information about the direction of energy flow in seismic signals, which can be used to identify different types of materials and structures in the subsurface.

The polarity of a seismic signal is determined by the direction of energy flow, which can be either positive or negative. Positive polarity indicates that the energy is moving towards the receiver, while negative polarity indicates that the energy is moving away from the receiver.

One of the most commonly used polarity attributes is the polarity of the signal itself. This can be measured in terms of its polarity in the time domain, or its polarity in the frequency domain. The polarity in the time domain is a measure of the direction of energy flow at a specific point in time, while the polarity in the frequency domain is a measure of the direction of energy flow at a specific frequency.

#### 14.1c Textural Attributes

Textural attributes are a relatively new aspect of seismic data interpretation. They provide information about the texture of the subsurface, which can be useful in identifying different types of materials and structures.

The texture of a subsurface is determined by the arrangement and distribution of the particles that make up the material. This can be influenced by factors such as the type of material, the presence of fluids, and the presence of fractures or cracks.

One of the most commonly used textural attributes is the texture of the subsurface itself. This can be measured in terms of its texture in the time domain, or its texture in the frequency domain.

## Solid representation schemes

Based on assumed mathematical properties, any scheme of representing solids is a method for capturing information about the class of semi-analytic subsets of Euclidean space. This means all representations are different ways of organizing the same geometric and topological data in the form of a data structure. All representation schemes are organized in terms of a finite number of operations on a set of primitives. Therefore, the modeling space of any particular representation is finite, and any single representation scheme may not completely suffice to represent all types of solids. For example, solids defined via combinations of regularized boolean operations cannot necessarily be represented as the sweep of a primitive moving according to a space trajectory, except in very simple cases. This forces modern geometric modeling systems to maintain several representation schemes of solids and also facilitate efficient conversion between representation schemes.

Below is a list of common techniques used to create or represent solid models. Modern modeling software may use a combination of these schemes to represent a solid.

### Primitive instancing

This scheme is based on notion of families of object, each member of a family distinguishable from the other by a few parameters. Each object family is represented by a set of primitives, which are geometric objects such as points, lines, and surfaces. The primitives are instanced, or copied, to create a family of objects. This scheme is useful for creating complex structures, such as buildings or landscapes, by combining simple primitives.

### Boundary representation

Boundary representation, or B-rep, is a common technique for representing solids. In this scheme, a solid is represented by its boundary, which is a set of faces, edges, and vertices. The faces are polygons, the edges are lines, and the vertices are points. This representation is useful for creating smooth, continuous surfaces, but it can be difficult to modify or edit the solid once it is created.

### Constructive solid geometry

Constructive solid geometry, or CSG, is a technique for representing solids by constructing them from simpler shapes. This is done by performing Boolean operations, such as union, intersection, and difference, on a set of primitive shapes. CSG is useful for creating complex solids, but it can be difficult to visualize and manipulate the resulting solid.

### Solid of revolution

A solid of revolution is a solid created by rotating a curve or surface around an axis. This technique is useful for creating cylindrical or spherical solids, but it can be limited in its ability to create more complex shapes.

### Swept surface

A swept surface is a solid created by moving a surface along a path. This technique is useful for creating solids with curved surfaces, such as a cylinder or a cone.

### Subdivision surface

A subdivision surface is a smooth surface created by subdividing a simpler surface into smaller, more detailed surfaces. This technique is useful for creating smooth, organic shapes, but it can be computationally intensive.

### Point cloud

A point cloud is a set of points in three-dimensional space. This representation is useful for capturing the surface of an object, but it can be difficult to interpret and manipulate.

### Mesh

A mesh is a set of connected polygons that form a surface. This representation is useful for creating complex surfaces, but it can be difficult to modify or edit the surface once it is created.

### NURBS

Non-uniform rational B-splines, or NURBS, are a mathematical representation of curves and surfaces. This representation is useful for creating smooth, continuous surfaces, but it can be difficult to visualize and manipulate.

### Polyhedron

A polyhedron is a solid created by joining a set of polygons along their edges. This representation is useful for creating simple solids, but it can be limited in its ability to create more complex shapes.

### Tessellation

A tessellation is a set of polygons that cover a surface without overlapping. This representation is useful for creating smooth, continuous surfaces, but it can be difficult to modify or edit the surface once it is created.

### Geometric attributes

Geometric attributes are properties of a solid that describe its shape and size. These attributes can include the number of vertices, edges, and faces, as well as the volume, surface area, and curvature of the solid. These attributes can be useful for identifying and classifying different types of solids.

### Topological attributes

Topological attributes are properties of a solid that describe its connectivity and relationships between its parts. These attributes can include the number of connected components, the number of holes, and the Euler characteristic of the solid. These attributes can be useful for identifying and classifying different types of solids.

### Material attributes

Material attributes are properties of a solid that describe its physical properties, such as its density, elasticity, and conductivity. These attributes can be useful for identifying and classifying different types of solids, as well as predicting their behavior under different conditions.

### Textural attributes

Textural attributes are properties of a solid that describe its surface texture, such as its roughness, smoothness, and pattern. These attributes can be useful for identifying and classifying different types of solids, as well as predicting their behavior under different conditions.

### Other attributes

Other attributes, such as color, transparency, and reflectivity, can also be used to describe and classify solids. These attributes can be useful for identifying and classifying different types of solids, as well as predicting their behavior under different conditions.

This section will provide an introduction to deterministic inversion and discuss its applications in geophysics.

#### 15.1a Acoustic Inversion

Acoustic inversion is a type of deterministic inversion that is commonly used in geophysics. It involves the use of acoustic waves to image the subsurface. Acoustic waves are mechanical waves that travel through a medium, and they are commonly used in seismic exploration due to their ability to penetrate deep into the Earth's crust.

The process of acoustic inversion involves the use of mathematical models and algorithms to invert the seismic data and create a detailed image of the subsurface. This is done by analyzing the properties of the acoustic waves, such as their velocity and attenuation, as they travel through the subsurface. By inverting the data, geophysicists can determine the properties of the subsurface, such as its density and elasticity.

One of the key advantages of acoustic inversion is its ability to provide high-resolution images of the subsurface. This is due to the fact that acoustic waves are sensitive to small changes in the properties of the subsurface, making them ideal for imaging shallow structures. Additionally, acoustic inversion can be used to image both the near-surface and deep subsurface, making it a versatile technique for geophysical exploration.

However, there are also limitations to acoustic inversion. One of the main challenges is the presence of noise and interference in the seismic data. This can make it difficult to accurately interpret the data and create a detailed image of the subsurface. Additionally, acoustic inversion relies on assumptions about the properties of the subsurface, which may not always be accurate.

Despite these limitations, acoustic inversion remains a valuable tool in geophysical exploration. It is commonly used in conjunction with other techniques, such as electromagnetic inversion, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the subsurface. In the next section, we will discuss another type of deterministic inversion - electromagnetic inversion.





### Section: 15.1b Elastic Inversion

Elastic inversion is another type of deterministic inversion that is commonly used in geophysics. It involves the use of elastic waves to image the subsurface. Elastic waves are mechanical waves that travel through a medium, and they are commonly used in seismic exploration due to their ability to penetrate deep into the Earth's crust.

The process of elastic inversion involves the use of mathematical models and algorithms to invert the seismic data and create a detailed image of the subsurface. This is done by analyzing the properties of the elastic waves, such as their velocity and attenuation, as they travel through the subsurface. By inverting the data, geophysicists can determine the properties of the subsurface, such as its density and elasticity.

One of the key advantages of elastic inversion is its ability to provide high-resolution images of the subsurface. This is due to the fact that elastic waves are sensitive to small changes in the properties of the subsurface, making them ideal for imaging both shallow and deep structures. Additionally, elastic inversion can be used to image both the near-surface and deep subsurface, making it a versatile technique for geophysical exploration.

However, there are also limitations to elastic inversion. One of the main challenges is the presence of noise and interference in the seismic data. This can make it difficult to accurately interpret the data and create a detailed image of the subsurface. Additionally, elastic inversion relies on assumptions about the properties of the subsurface, such as homogeneity and isotropy, which may not always be accurate.

### Subsection: 15.1b.1 Pre-Stack Seismic Resolution Inversion

Pre-stack inversion is often used when post-stack inversion fails to sufficiently differentiate geologic features with similar P-impedance signatures. Simultaneous inversion solves for S-impedance and density, in addition to P-impedance. While many geologic features can express similar P-impedance characteristics, few will share combined P-impedance and S-impedance traits (allowing improved separation and clarity). Often a feasibility study using the wells logs will indicate whether separation of the desired lithotype can be achieved with P-impedance alone or whether S-impedance is also required. This will dictate whether a pre- or post-stack inversion is needed.

Simultaneous Inversion (SI) is a pre-stack method that uses multiple offset or angle seismic sub-stacks and their associated wavelets as input; it generates P-impedance, S-impedance and density as outputs (although the density output resolution is rarely as high as the impedances). This helps improve discrimination between lithology, porosity and fluid effects. For each input partial stack, a unique wavelet is estimated. All models, partial stacks and wavelets are input to a single inversion algorithm — enabling inversion to effectively compensate for offset-dependent phase, bandwidth, tuning and NMO stretch effects.

The inversion algorithm works by first estimating angle-dependent P-wave reflectivities for the input-partial stacks. Next, these are used with the full Zoeppritz equations (or approximations, such as Aki–Richards, for some algorithms) to find band-limited elastic reflectivities. These are in turn merged with their low-frequency counterparts from the model and integrated to elastic properties. This approximate result is then improved in a final inversion for P-impedance, S-impedance and density, subject to various hard and soft constraints. One constraint can control the resolution of the inversion, with higher resolution resulting in a more detailed image of the subsurface.

### Subsection: 15.1b.2 Post-Stack Seismic Resolution Inversion

Post-stack inversion is another type of deterministic inversion that is commonly used in geophysics. It involves the use of post-stack data, which is data that has been processed and stacked together from multiple sources. This type of inversion is often used when pre-stack inversion is not feasible or when the data is already processed and stacked.

The process of post-stack inversion involves the use of mathematical models and algorithms to invert the post-stack data and create a detailed image of the subsurface. This is done by analyzing the properties of the post-stack data, such as its velocity and attenuation, as they travel through the subsurface. By inverting the data, geophysicists can determine the properties of the subsurface, such as its density and elasticity.

One of the key advantages of post-stack inversion is its ability to provide high-resolution images of the subsurface. This is due to the fact that post-stack data is already processed and stacked, making it easier to interpret and invert. Additionally, post-stack inversion can be used to image both the near-surface and deep subsurface, making it a versatile technique for geophysical exploration.

However, there are also limitations to post-stack inversion. One of the main challenges is the presence of noise and interference in the post-stack data. This can make it difficult to accurately interpret the data and create a detailed image of the subsurface. Additionally, post-stack inversion relies on assumptions about the properties of the subsurface, such as homogeneity and isotropy, which may not always be accurate.

### Section: 15.1c Joint Inversion

Joint inversion is a powerful technique used in geophysics to image the subsurface. It combines the principles of both elastic and acoustic inversion to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the subsurface properties. This technique is particularly useful in complex geological environments where traditional inversion methods may not be sufficient.

The process of joint inversion involves the use of both P-waves and S-waves to image the subsurface. P-waves, or primary waves, are compressional waves that travel through the subsurface, while S-waves, or shear waves, are shear waves that travel along the subsurface. By analyzing the properties of these waves, such as their velocity and attenuation, joint inversion can provide a more detailed image of the subsurface.

One of the key advantages of joint inversion is its ability to image both the near-surface and deep subsurface. This is due to the fact that P-waves and S-waves have different propagation characteristics, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the subsurface properties. Additionally, joint inversion can be used to image both homogeneous and heterogeneous subsurface structures, making it a versatile technique for geophysical exploration.

However, there are also limitations to joint inversion. One of the main challenges is the presence of noise and interference in the seismic data. This can make it difficult to accurately interpret the data and create a detailed image of the subsurface.

However, there are also limitations to pre-stack joint inversion. One of the main challenges is the presence of noise and interference in the seismic data. This can make it difficult to accurately interpret the data and create a detailed image of the subsurface. Additionally, pre-stack joint inversion relies on assumptions about the properties of the subsurface, such as homogeneity and isotropy, which may not always be accurate.

## Chapter: Near-Surface Geophysical Imaging Textbook

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the topic of seismic migration, which is a crucial aspect of near-surface geophysical imaging. Seismic migration is a process used to enhance the quality of seismic images by correcting for the effects of wave propagation through the Earth's subsurface. This technique is essential for accurately interpreting seismic data and understanding the subsurface structure.

The main goal of seismic migration is to transform the recorded seismic data into a more accurate representation of the subsurface structure. This is achieved by correcting for the effects of wave propagation, which can distort the original signal and make it difficult to interpret. By applying migration techniques, we can improve the resolution and quality of the seismic images, allowing us to better understand the subsurface structure and its properties.

In this chapter, we will cover the fundamentals of seismic migration, including the principles behind it and the different types of migration techniques. We will also discuss the applications of seismic migration in various fields, such as oil and gas exploration, groundwater mapping, and structural geology. Additionally, we will explore the challenges and limitations of seismic migration and how it can be used in conjunction with other geophysical techniques to overcome these limitations.

Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of seismic migration and its importance in near-surface geophysical imaging. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid foundation in the principles and applications of seismic migration, allowing them to apply this knowledge in their own research and studies. So let us dive into the world of seismic migration and discover its potential in unraveling the mysteries of the Earth's subsurface.

### Section: 16.1 Wave Propagation Modeling:

In this section, we will explore the concept of wave propagation modeling, which is a crucial aspect of seismic forward modeling. Wave propagation refers to the movement of seismic waves through the Earth's subsurface. Understanding how these waves propagate is essential for accurately predicting the behavior of seismic signals and for interpreting the results of seismic surveys.

#### 16.1a Finite Difference Method

The Finite Difference Method (FDM) is a numerical technique used to approximate solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs). In the context of seismic forward modeling, FDM is used to model the propagation of seismic waves through the Earth's subsurface.

The FDM is based on the Taylor series expansion, which allows us to approximate the derivatives of a function at a given point by using the values of the function at nearby points. In the context of seismic forward modeling, the FDM is used to approximate the propagation of seismic waves through the subsurface by discretizing the subsurface into a grid of points and approximating the derivatives of the wavefield at each point.

The FDM is particularly useful for modeling wave propagation in complex subsurface structures, such as layered media or heterogeneous media. By discretizing the subsurface into a grid of points, the FDM allows us to model the propagation of seismic waves through these complex structures in a systematic and efficient manner.

The FDM is also well-suited for modeling wave propagation in anisotropic media, where the properties of the medium (such as the velocity of seismic waves) vary in different directions. By discretizing the subsurface into a grid of points, the FDM allows us to model the anisotropic properties of the medium in a straightforward manner.

However, the FDM also has its limitations. For example, it is a first-order numerical method, which means that the accuracy of the approximation depends on the size of the grid points. Smaller grid points result in a more accurate approximation, but also require more computational resources.

In the next section, we will explore another numerical method for modeling wave propagation: the Finite Element Method (FEM).

#### 16.1b Finite Element Method

The Finite Element Method (FEM) is another numerical technique used to approximate solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs). In the context of seismic forward modeling, FEM is used to model the propagation of seismic waves through the Earth's subsurface.

The FEM is based on the concept of dividing a continuous domain into a finite number of smaller, simpler domains called finite elements. These elements are connected at points called nodes, forming a mesh. The behavior of the system is then approximated by interpolating the solution within each element from the known values at the nodes.

In the context of seismic forward modeling, the FEM is used to model the propagation of seismic waves through the subsurface by discretizing the subsurface into a mesh of finite elements. The behavior of the wavefield is then approximated by interpolating the wavefield within each element from the known values at the nodes.

The FEM is particularly useful for modeling wave propagation in complex subsurface structures, such as layered media or heterogeneous media. By discretizing the subsurface into a mesh of finite elements, the FEM allows us to model the propagation of seismic waves through these complex structures in a systematic and efficient manner.

The FEM is also well-suited for modeling wave propagation in anisotropic media, where the properties of the medium (such as the velocity of seismic waves) vary in different directions. By discretizing the subsurface into a mesh of finite elements, the FEM allows us to model the anisotropic properties of the medium in a straightforward manner.

However, the FEM also has its limitations. For example, it is a second-order numerical method, which means that the accuracy of the approximation depends on the size of the elements. Smaller elements result in a more accurate approximation, but also require more computational resources.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of wave propagation modeling in more detail, focusing on the application of the Finite Difference Method and the Finite Element Method in seismic forward modeling.

#### 16.1c Ray Tracing Method

The Ray Tracing Method is a numerical technique used to model the propagation of seismic waves through the Earth's subsurface. This method is based on the principle of ray optics, where seismic waves are represented as rays that travel through the subsurface.

In the context of seismic forward modeling, the Ray Tracing Method is used to model the propagation of seismic waves through the subsurface by tracing the path of these rays. The subsurface is represented as a series of layers, each with its own velocity and density. The rays are then traced through these layers, taking into account the changes in velocity and density.

The Ray Tracing Method is particularly useful for modeling wave propagation in layered media, where the subsurface can be represented as a series of layers with different properties. By tracing the rays through these layers, the Ray Tracing Method allows us to model the propagation of seismic waves through these complex structures in a systematic and efficient manner.

The Ray Tracing Method is also well-suited for modeling wave propagation in anisotropic media, where the properties of the medium (such as the velocity of seismic waves) vary in different directions. By tracing the rays through these layers, the Ray Tracing Method allows us to model the anisotropic properties of the medium in a straightforward manner.

However, the Ray Tracing Method also has its limitations. For example, it is a first-order numerical method, which means that the accuracy of the approximation depends on the size of the grid points. Smaller grid points result in a more accurate approximation, but also require more computational resources.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of wave propagation modeling in more detail, focusing on the application of the Ray Tracing Method in seismic forward modeling.

#### 16.1d Wave Equation Method

The Wave Equation Method is a numerical technique used to model the propagation of seismic waves through the Earth's subsurface. This method is based on the wave equation, a second-order linear partial differential equation that describes the propagation of a variety of waves, such as sound waves, light waves, and seismic waves.

In the context of seismic forward modeling, the Wave Equation Method is used to model the propagation of seismic waves through the subsurface by solving the wave equation. The subsurface is represented as a continuous medium with a specific velocity and density. The wave equation is then solved for the displacement of the medium at each point in space and time.

The Wave Equation Method is particularly useful for modeling wave propagation in continuous media, where the subsurface cannot be easily represented as a series of layers. By solving the wave equation, the Wave Equation Method allows us to model the propagation of seismic waves through these complex structures in a systematic and efficient manner.

The Wave Equation Method is also well-suited for modeling wave propagation in isotropic media, where the properties of the medium (such as the velocity of seismic waves) are the same in all directions. By solving the wave equation, the Wave Equation Method allows us to model the isotropic properties of the medium in a straightforward manner.

However, the Wave Equation Method also has its limitations. For example, it is a second-order numerical method, which means that the accuracy of the approximation depends on the size of the grid points. Smaller grid points result in a more accurate approximation, but also require more computational resources.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of wave propagation modeling in more detail, focusing on the application of the Wave Equation Method in seismic forward modeling.

#### 16.1e Seismic Wave Propagation in Complex Media

Seismic wave propagation in complex media is a challenging problem due to the inherent complexity of the Earth's subsurface. The subsurface is often characterized by heterogeneity, anisotropy, and non-uniformity, which can significantly affect the propagation of seismic waves. In this section, we will discuss some of the techniques used to model seismic wave propagation in complex media.

##### 16.1e.1 Multiscale Modeling

Multiscale modeling is a technique used to model the propagation of seismic waves in complex media. This technique is based on the concept of representing the subsurface as a collection of smaller, simpler models or units, which are then combined to form a larger model of the subsurface.

The multiscale modeling approach allows us to capture the complexity of the subsurface while maintaining computational efficiency. By representing the subsurface as a collection of smaller models, we can avoid the need to solve the wave equation for the entire subsurface, which can be computationally intensive. Instead, we can solve the wave equation for each individual model and then combine the results to obtain the overall solution.

##### 16.1e.2 Stochastic Modeling

Stochastic modeling is another technique used to model the propagation of seismic waves in complex media. This technique is based on the concept of representing the subsurface as a random field, where the properties of the medium (such as the velocity and density) are described by a probability distribution.

The stochastic modeling approach allows us to account for the uncertainty and variability in the properties of the subsurface. By representing the subsurface as a random field, we can account for the variability in the properties of the medium, which can significantly affect the propagation of seismic waves.

##### 16.1e.3 Hybrid Modeling

Hybrid modeling is a combination of the multiscale and stochastic modeling approaches. In this approach, the subsurface is represented as a collection of smaller models, and each model is characterized by a probability distribution.

The hybrid modeling approach allows us to capture the complexity of the subsurface while accounting for the uncertainty and variability in the properties of the subsurface. By combining the multiscale and stochastic modeling approaches, we can obtain a more accurate and robust model of the subsurface.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the applications of these techniques in seismic forward modeling.

### Introduction

Seismic inversion is a critical aspect of geophysical imaging, a technique used to create images of the Earth's subsurface. This chapter will delve into the intricacies of seismic inversion, providing a comprehensive understanding of its principles, applications, and limitations.

Seismic inversion is a process that transforms seismic data into images of the subsurface. It is a powerful tool in the hands of geophysicists, allowing them to visualize the Earth's interior and understand its structure.

### Introduction to Spectral Element Method

The Spectral Element Method (SEM) is a numerical technique used in the field of geophysics for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). It is a high-order finite element method that uses spectral interpolation to approximate the solution of PDEs. The SEM was first introduced by A. T. Patera in 1984 and has since been widely used in various applications, including seismic forward modeling.

The SEM is particularly useful for solving PDEs that involve high-order derivatives, such as the wave equation in seismic forward modeling. The method is based on the idea of representing the solution as a sum of basis functions, which are typically high-order polynomials. These basis functions are chosen such that they satisfy certain interpolation conditions, leading to a high-order approximation of the solution.

The SEM is implemented in a number of freely available codes, including the Spectral Element Equations Solver (SEES) and the Spectral Element Toolkit (SET). These codes provide a flexible and efficient implementation of the SEM, allowing for the solution of a wide range of PDEs.

#### 16.1c.1 Implementation of the Spectral Element Method

The implementation of the SEM involves the following steps:

1. Discretization of the domain into a set of spectral elements.
2. Definition of the basis functions for each element.
3. Assembly of the global stiffness matrix and load vector.
4. Solution of the resulting linear system.
5. Post-processing of the solution.

The first step involves discretizing the domain into a set of spectral elements. This is typically done using a structured grid, where each element is a simple geometric shape, such as a triangle or a quadrilateral. The number of elements and their size can be adjusted to control the level of detail in the solution.

The next step is to define the basis functions for each element. These are typically high-order polynomials, such as Legendre or Chebyshev polynomials, and are chosen such that they satisfy certain interpolation conditions. The choice of basis functions depends on the specific problem and can significantly affect the accuracy and efficiency of the solution.

The global stiffness matrix and load vector are then assembled by summing the contributions from each element. This involves the evaluation of the basis functions and their derivatives at the element interfaces, as well as the assembly of the element matrices and vectors.

The resulting linear system is then solved using a suitable solver. This can be done using direct methods, such as Gaussian elimination or LU decomposition, or iterative methods, such as the conjugate gradient method.

Finally, the solution is post-processed to extract the desired information, such as the displacement or stress at specific points in the domain. This can be done using various techniques, such as interpolation or differentiation of the solution.

#### 16.1c.2 Advantages and Limitations of the Spectral Element Method

The SEM offers several advantages over other numerical methods, including:

1. High-order accuracy: The SEM provides a high-order approximation of the solution, leading to more accurate results.
2. Stability: The SEM is a stable method, meaning that small errors in the input data do not lead to large errors in the solution.
3. Efficiency: The SEM is an efficient method, particularly for problems with high-order derivatives.

However, the SEM also has some limitations, including:

1. Complexity: The implementation of the SEM can be complex, particularly for problems with complex geometries or boundary conditions.
2. Memory requirements: The SEM requires a significant amount of memory to store the global stiffness matrix and load vector, which can be a limitation for large-scale problems.
3. Sensitivity to the choice of basis functions: The accuracy of the SEM can be significantly affected by the choice of basis functions, which can be challenging to determine for complex problems.

Despite these limitations, the SEM remains a powerful tool for solving PDEs in geophysics and other fields. Its high-order accuracy and efficiency make it particularly well-suited for problems involving high-order derivatives, such as seismic forward modeling.




#### 16.1d Boundary Element Method

The Boundary Element Method (BEM) is a numerical technique used in geophysics for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). It is a boundary-based method that uses the boundary conditions of the problem to solve for the solution. The BEM is particularly useful for solving PDEs that involve high-order derivatives, such as the wave equation in seismic forward modeling.

The BEM is implemented in a number of freely available codes, including the Boundary Element Equations Solver (BEES) and the Boundary Element Toolkit (BET). These codes provide a flexible and efficient implementation of the BEM, allowing for the solution of a wide range of PDEs.

#### 16.1d.1 Implementation of the Boundary Element Method

The implementation of the BEM involves the following steps:

1. Discretization of the boundary into a set of boundary elements.
2. Definition of the boundary conditions for each element.
3. Assembly of the global boundary element matrix and load vector.
4. Solution of the resulting linear system.
5. Post-processing of the solution.

The first step involves discretizing the boundary into a set of boundary elements. This is typically done using a structured grid, where each element is a simple geometric shape, such as a triangle or a quadrilateral. The number of elements and their size can be adjusted to control the level of detail in the solution.

The next step is to define the boundary conditions for each element. These are typically given in terms of the normal and tangential derivatives of the solution at the boundary. These boundary conditions are used to construct the boundary element matrix and load vector.

The assembly of the global boundary element matrix and load vector involves summing the contributions from each element. This is typically done using numerical integration techniques, such as the Gauss quadrature.

The solution of the resulting linear system is typically done using a direct solver, such as the LU decomposition. The solution provides the values of the solution at the boundary.

The post-processing of the solution involves calculating the solution at any desired point in the interior of the solution domain. This is typically done using the boundary element method, which attempts to use the given boundary conditions to fit boundary values into the integral equation.

The BEM is applicable to problems for which Green's functions can be calculated. These usually involve fields in linear homogeneous media. This places considerable restrictions on the range and generality of problems to which boundary elements can usefully be applied. Nonlinearities can be included in the formulation, although they will generally introduce volume integrals which then require the volume to be discretised before solution can be attempted, removing one of the most often cited advantages of BEM. A useful technique for treating the volume integral without discretising the volume is the dual-reciprocity method. The technique approximates part of the integrand using radial basis functions (local interpolating functions) and converts the volume integral into boundary integral after collocating at selected points distributed throughout the volume domain (including the boundary). In the dual-reciprocity BEM, although there is no need to discretize the volume into meshes, unknowns at chosen points inside the solution domain are involved.

## Chapter: - Chapter 17: Seismic Migration:




### Section: 17.1 Pre-stack Migration:

Pre-stack migration is a crucial step in the seismic imaging process. It involves the migration of seismic data from the subsurface to the surface, allowing for a more accurate interpretation of the data. In this section, we will discuss the basics of pre-stack migration, including its purpose and the different types of pre-stack migration methods.

#### 17.1a Kirchhoff Migration

Kirchhoff migration is a type of pre-stack migration method that is commonly used in the oil and gas industry. It is based on the Kirchhoff's integral theorem, which states that the displacement of a point on a surface can be calculated by integrating the normal derivative of the surface over the entire surface. This theorem is used to calculate the displacement of a point on the subsurface from the surface data.

The Kirchhoff migration method involves the use of a migration operator, which is a mathematical function that maps the subsurface data to the surface data. This operator is based on the Kirchhoff's integral theorem and is used to calculate the displacement of a point on the subsurface from the surface data. The migration operator is typically represented by the symbol M and is defined as:

$$
M = \int_{\Omega} N_{11}\frac{\partial\delta v_1}{\partial x_1} + N_{12}\frac{\partial\delta v_1}{\partial x_2}\,d\Omega = -\int_{\Omega} p_1 \delta v_1 \,d\Omega \\
&+ \int_{\Omega} N_{22}\frac{\partial\delta v_2}{\partial x_2} + N_{12}\frac{\partial\delta v_2}{\partial x_1}\,d\Omega = -\int_{\Omega} p_2 \delta v_2 \,d\Omega \\
&+ \int_{\Omega} N_{11}\frac{\partial w}{\partial x_1}\frac{\partial\delta w}{\partial x_1} - M_{11}\frac{\partial^2 \delta w}{\partial^2 x_1} \,d\Omega\\
&+ \int_{\Omega} N_{22}\frac{\partial w}{\partial x_2}\frac{\partial\delta w}{\partial x_2} - M_{22}\frac{\partial^2 \delta w}{\partial^2 x_2} \,d\Omega\\
&+ \int_{\Omega} N_{12}\left(\frac{\partial \delta w}{\partial x_1}\frac{\partial\delta w}{\partial x_2} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial x_1}\frac{\partial\delta w}{\partial x_2}\right) - 2M_{12}\frac{\partial^2 \delta w}{\partial x_1\partial x_2} \,d\Omega = -\int_{\Omega} p_3 \delta w \,d\Omega\\

The resulting governing equations are

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x_1^2} - M_{11}\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial^2 x_1} &= p_1 \\
\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x_2^2} - M_{22}\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial^2 x_2} &= p_2 \\
\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x_1\partial x_2} - 2M_{12}\frac{\partial^2 w}{\partial x_1\partial x_2} &= p_3
\end{align}
$$

These equations can be solved using various numerical methods to obtain the migration operator M. Once the migration operator is known, the displacement of a point on the subsurface can be calculated by applying the operator to the surface data.

Kirchhoff migration is a powerful tool for imaging the subsurface, but it has its limitations. It is most effective when the subsurface is relatively flat and homogeneous. In more complex geological structures, other migration methods may be more suitable. In the next section, we will discuss another type of pre-stack migration method known as finite-difference migration.





#### 17.1b Wave-equation Migration

Wave-equation migration is another type of pre-stack migration method that is commonly used in the oil and gas industry. It is based on the wave equation, which describes the propagation of seismic waves through a medium. The wave equation is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $u$ is the displacement of the wave, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the wave speed.

The wave-equation migration method involves the use of a migration operator, which is a mathematical function that maps the subsurface data to the surface data. This operator is based on the wave equation and is used to calculate the displacement of a point on the subsurface from the surface data. The migration operator is typically represented by the symbol M and is defined as:

$$
M = \int_{\Omega} N_{11}\frac{\partial\delta v_1}{\partial x_1} + N_{12}\frac{\partial\delta v_1}{\partial x_2}\,d\Omega = -\int_{\Omega} p_1 \delta v_1 \,d\Omega \\
&+ \int_{\Omega} N_{22}\frac{\partial\delta v_2}{\partial x_2} + N_{12}\frac{\partial\delta v_2}{\partial x_1}\,d\Omega = -\int_{\Omega} p_2 \delta v_2 \,d\Omega \\
&+ \int_{\Omega} N_{11}\frac{\partial w}{\partial x_1}\frac{\partial\delta w}{\partial x_1} - M_{11}\frac{\partial^2 \delta w}{\partial^2 x_1} \,d\Omega\\
&+ \int_{\Omega} N_{22}\frac{\partial w}{\partial x_2}\frac{\partial\delta w}{\partial x_2} - M_{22}\frac{\partial^2 \delta w}{\partial^2 x_2} \,d\Omega\\
&+ \int_{\Omega} N_{12}\left(\frac{\partial \delta w}{\partial x_1}\frac{\partial\delta w}{\partial x_2} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial x_1}\frac{\partial\delta w}{\partial x_2}\right) - M_{12}\frac{\partial^2 \delta w}{\partial x_1\partial x_2} \,d\Omega\\
&+ \int_{\Omega} N_{11}\frac{\partial w}{\partial x_1}\frac{\partial^2 \delta w}{\partial x_1\partial t} - M_{11}\frac{\partial^2 \delta w}{\partial x_1\partial t} \,d\Omega\\
&+ \int_{\Omega} N_{22}\frac{\partial w}{\partial x_2}\frac{\partial^2 \delta w}{\partial x_2\partial t} - M_{22}\frac{\partial^2 \delta w}{\partial x_2\partial t} \,d\Omega\\
&+ \int_{\Omega} N_{12}\left(\frac{\partial w}{\partial x_1}\frac{\partial^2 \delta w}{\partial x_2\partial t} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial x_2}\frac{\partial^2 \delta w}{\partial x_1\partial t}\right) - M_{12}\frac{\partial^2 \delta w}{\partial x_1\partial x_2\partial t} \,d\Omega\\
$$

where $N_{ij}$ are the shape functions, $p_i$ are the pressure coefficients, and $w$ is the displacement function.

The wave-equation migration method is particularly useful for imaging complex subsurface structures, such as faults and interfaces, as it takes into account the wave propagation effects. However, it requires a good understanding of the wave equation and the subsurface properties in order to accurately interpret the migration results.

#### 17.1c Common Applications

Seismic migration, both pre-stack and post-stack, has a wide range of applications in the field of geophysics. These applications span across various industries, including oil and gas exploration, mineral exploration, and environmental studies. In this section, we will discuss some of the common applications of seismic migration.

##### Mineral Exploration

Seismic migration is also used in mineral exploration, particularly in the search for precious metals and minerals. The imaging of subsurface structures can provide valuable information about the distribution of these resources. For example, the wave-equation migration method can be used to image the propagation of seismic waves through the subsurface, which can provide insights into the mineral content of the rocks.

## Chapter: Chapter 18: Post-stack Migration

### Introduction

In the realm of geophysics, the process of migration is a crucial step in the interpretation of seismic data. It is a mathematical technique used to enhance the quality of seismic images by reducing noise and artifacts. In this chapter, we will delve into the post-stack migration, a specific type of migration technique that is widely used in the industry.

Post-stack migration is a process that is applied to the migrated stacked data. It is a powerful tool that can provide a more accurate image of the subsurface structures. The process involves the application of a migration operator to the stacked data, which is a result of the pre-stack migration. This operator is designed to correct the effects of the medium and the source, and to focus the energy on the subsurface structures.

Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional in the field of geophysics, this chapter will serve as a valuable resource for you.




#### 17.1c Reverse Time Migration

Reverse time migration (RTM) is a powerful pre-stack migration method that is used to image the subsurface from surface data. It is based on the principle of reverse time, where the migration process is performed in reverse order, starting from the surface data and moving towards the subsurface. This method is particularly useful for imaging complex structures and interfaces, such as faults and unconformities, which are often difficult to image using traditional migration methods.

The RTM method involves the use of a migration operator, which is a mathematical function that maps the surface data to the subsurface data. This operator is based on the wave equation and is used to calculate the displacement of a point on the subsurface from the surface data. The migration operator is typically represented by the symbol M and is defined as:

$$
M = \int_{\Omega} N_{11}\frac{\partial\delta v_1}{\partial x_1} + N_{12}\frac{\partial\delta v_1}{\partial x_2}\,d\Omega = -\int_{\Omega} p_1 \delta v_1 \,d\Omega \\
&+ \int_{\Omega} N_{22}\frac{\partial\delta v_2}{\partial x_2} + N_{12}\frac{\partial\delta v_2}{\partial x_1}\,d\Omega = -\int_{\Omega} p_2 \delta v_2 \,d\Omega \\
&+ \int_{\Omega} N_{11}\frac{\partial w}{\partial x_1}\frac{\partial\delta w}{\partial x_1} - M_{11}\frac{\partial^2 \delta w}{\partial^2 x_1} \,d\Omega\\
&+ \int_{\Omega} N_{22}\frac{\partial w}{\partial x_2}\frac{\partial\delta w}{\partial x_2} - M_{22}\frac{\partial^2 \delta w}{\partial^2 x_2} \,d\Omega\\
&+ \int_{\Omega} N_{12}\left(\frac{\partial \delta w}{\partial x_1}\frac{\partial\delta w}{\partial x_2} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial x_1}\frac{\partial\delta w}{\partial x_2}\right) - M_{12}\frac{\partial^2 \delta w}{\partial x_1\partial x_2} \,d\Omega\\

#### 17.1d Least-squares Migration

Least-squares migration (LSM) is another powerful pre-stack migration method that is used to image the subsurface from surface data. It is based on the principle of least squares, where the migration process is performed by minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed data and the predicted data. This method is particularly useful for imaging complex structures and interfaces, such as faults and unconformities, which are often difficult to image using traditional migration methods.

The LSM method involves the use of a migration operator, which is a mathematical function that maps the surface data to the subsurface data. This operator is based on the wave equation and is used to calculate the displacement of a point on the subsurface from the surface data. The migration operator is typically represented by the symbol M and is defined as:

$$
M = \int_{\Omega} N_{11}\frac{\partial\delta v_1}{\partial x_1} + N_{12}\frac{\partial\delta v_1}{\partial x_2}\,d\Omega = -\int_{\Omega} p_1 \delta v_1 \,d\Omega \\

&+ \int_{\Omega} N_{11}\frac{\partial w}{\partial x_1}\frac{\partial^2 \delta w}{\partial x_1\partial t} - M_{11}\frac{\partial^2 \delta w}{\partial x_1\partial t} \,d\Omega\\
&+ \int_{\Omega} N_{22}\frac{\partial 
$$

The LSM method then minimizes the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed data and the predicted data, which is represented by the term $\int_{\Omega} (p - M\delta w)^2 \,d\Omega$. This minimization process results in a migration operator that maps the surface data to the subsurface data in a way that minimizes the differences between the observed and predicted data.

The LSM method has been applied to a wide range of problems since it was first published in 1993. It has been used in the optimization of glass recycling, in the development of new algorithms and workflows for geodetic data processing, and in the imaging of complex structures and interfaces in the subsurface. Its ability to handle complex structures and interfaces makes it a valuable tool for geophysical imaging.

## Chapter: - Chapter 18: Seismic AVO Analysis:




### Section: 18.1 AVO Theory:

The Amplitude Variation with Offset (AVO) analysis is a powerful tool in geophysics that allows us to study the properties of the Earth's subsurface. It is based on the Zoeppritz equations, which describe the reflection and transmission of seismic waves at the interface between two different media. These equations are essential for understanding the behavior of seismic waves and their interaction with the subsurface.

#### 18.1a Zoeppritz Equations

The Zoeppritz equations consist of four equations with four unknowns: the reflected P-wave amplitude coefficient (R<sub>P</sub>), the reflected S-wave amplitude coefficient (R<sub>S</sub>), the transmitted P-wave amplitude coefficient (T<sub>P</sub>), and the transmitted S-wave amplitude coefficient (T<sub>S</sub>). These equations are given by:

$$
R_P = \frac{V_P}{V_P + V_S} \left( \frac{V_P - V_S}{V_P + V_S} \right) \left( \frac{\rho_2 - \rho_1}{\rho_2 + \rho_1} \right)
$$

$$
R_S = \frac{V_S}{V_P + V_S} \left( \frac{V_P - V_S}{V_P + V_S} \right) \left( \frac{\rho_2 - \rho_1}{\rho_2 + \rho_1} \right)
$$

$$
T_P = \frac{2V_P}{V_P + V_S} \left( \frac{V_P - V_S}{V_P + V_S} \right) \left( \frac{\rho_2 - \rho_1}{\rho_2 + \rho_1} \right)
$$

$$
T_S = \frac{2V_S}{V_P + V_S} \left( \frac{V_P - V_S}{V_P + V_S} \right) \left( \frac{\rho_2 - \rho_1}{\rho_2 + \rho_1} \right)
$$

where <math>{\theta}_{1}</math>=angle of incidence, <math>{\theta}_{2}</math>=angle of the transmitted P-wave, <math>{\phi}_{1}</math>=angle of reflected S-wave and <math>{\phi}_{2}</math>=angle of the transmitted S-wave.

These equations can be solved for the four unknowns, but they do not give an intuitive understanding for how the reflection amplitudes vary with the rock properties involved (density, velocity etc.). Several attempts have been made to develop approximations to the Zoeppritz equations, such as Bortfeld's (1961) and Aki & Richards’ (1980), but the most successful of these is the Shuey's, which assumes Poisson's ratio to be the elastic property most directly related to the angular dependence of the reflection coefficient.

#### 18.1b Shuey Equation

The Shuey equation is a simplified form of the Zoeppritz equations that is often used in AVO analysis. It is given by:

$$
R(0) + G\Delta\theta + F\Delta\theta^2 = 0
$$

where <math>{\theta}</math>=angle of incidence; <math>{V_p}</math> = P-wave velocity in medium; <math> \left ( \frac{\Delta \rho}{\rho} + 2 \frac{\Delta V_\mathrm{S}}{V_\mathrm{S}} \right ) </math>

In the Shuey equation, R(0) is the reflection coefficient at normal incidence and is controlled by the contrast in acoustic impedances. G, often referred to as the AVO gradient, describes the variation of reflection amplitudes at intermediate offsets and the third term, F, describes the behavior at large angles/far offsets that are close to the critical angle.

The Shuey equation can be further simplified by assuming that the angle of incidence is less than 30 degrees (i.e. the offset is relatively small), so the third term will be truncated. This simplification is often used in practice, as it allows for a more intuitive understanding of the AVO behavior.

In the next section, we will explore the applications of the Shuey equation in AVO analysis and how it can be used to interpret seismic data.

### Program to solve arbitrary non-linear equations

The Gauss-Seidel method is a numerical technique used to solve a system of linear equations. It is an iterative method that uses the values of the previous iteration to calculate the values of the current iteration. This method is particularly useful when dealing with large systems of equations, as it can provide a solution in a relatively short amount of time.

The general form of a system of linear equations can be written as:

$$
\begin{align*}
a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + ... + a_{1n}x_n &= b_1 \\
a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + ... + a_{2n}x_n &= b_2 \\
... \\
a_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2 + ... + a_{mn}x_n &= b_m
\end{align*}
$$

where $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ are the unknown variables and $a_{ij}$ and $b_i$ are known constants.

The Gauss-Seidel method works by solving the equations one at a time, using the values of the previous iteration to calculate the values of the current iteration. This process is repeated until the values of the unknown variables converge to a solution.

The algorithm for the Gauss-Seidel method can be summarized as follows:

1. Initialize the unknown variables $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ with initial guesses.
2. For each equation in the system, use the values of the unknown variables from the previous iteration to calculate the values of the current iteration.
3. Repeat this process until the values of the unknown variables converge to a solution.

The Gauss-Seidel method is a powerful tool for solving large systems of linear equations, and it has many applications in various fields, including geophysics. In the next section, we will explore how this method can be used in AVO analysis.

### Introduction

Seismic anisotropy is a fundamental concept in the field of geophysics, particularly in the study of near-surface geophysical imaging. It refers to the directional dependence of seismic wave velocities and properties, which can significantly impact the interpretation of seismic data. In this chapter, we will delve into the intricacies of seismic anisotropy, exploring its causes, effects, and methods of detection and analysis.

The study of seismic anisotropy is crucial for understanding the physical properties of the Earth's subsurface. It allows us to infer the presence of anisotropic materials, such as fractured rocks or aligned mineral grains, which can significantly affect the propagation of seismic waves. This knowledge is vital for a wide range of applications, from mineral exploration and reservoir characterization to earthquake prediction and hazard assessment.

In this chapter, we will begin by discussing the basic principles of seismic anisotropy, including the definitions of anisotropic and isotropic materials, and the concept of seismic wave velocity anisotropy. We will then explore the various factors that can cause seismic anisotropy, such as the alignment of mineral grains, fractures, and cracks in the rock. We will also discuss the effects of anisotropy on seismic wave propagation, including the phenomenon of wave splitting and the changes in wave velocity and attenuation.

Next, we will delve into the methods of detecting and analyzing seismic anisotropy. This includes the use of shear-wave splitting techniques, such as the P-wave and S-wave splitting, and the analysis of seismic wave dispersion. We will also discuss the role of seismic anisotropy in the interpretation of seismic data, including the challenges and opportunities it presents for geophysical imaging.

Finally, we will explore the implications of seismic anisotropy for various geophysical applications. This includes the use of anisotropic models in reservoir characterization and the prediction of earthquake hazards. We will also discuss the potential of seismic anisotropy for enhancing the resolution of near-surface geophysical imaging, and the future directions of research in this exciting field.

In summary, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the fascinating world of seismic anisotropy. It is our hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource for students, researchers, and professionals in the field of geophysics, and contribute to the advancement of our understanding of the Earth's near-surface.




### Subsection: 19.1a Transverse Isotropy

Transverse isotropy is a type of anisotropic media where the physical properties are symmetric about an axis that is normal to a plane of isotropy. This plane has infinite planes of symmetry, and thus, within this plane, the material properties are the same in all directions. This type of material is also known as "polar anisotropic" materials. In geophysics, vertically transverse isotropy (VTI) is also known as radial anisotropy.

This type of material exhibits hexagonal symmetry, so the number of independent constants in the (fourth-rank) elasticity tensor are reduced to 5 (from a total of 21 independent constants in the case of a fully anisotropic solid). The (second-rank) tensors of electrical resistivity, permeability, etc. have two independent constants.

#### Example of Transversely Isotropic Materials

An example of a transversely isotropic material is the so-called on-axis unidirectional fiber composite lamina where the fibers are circular in cross section. In a unidirectional composite, the plane normal to the fiber direction can be considered as the isotropic plane, at long wavelengths (low frequencies) of excitation. In the figure to the right, the fibers would be aligned with the $x_2$ axis, which is normal to the plane of isotropy.

In terms of effective properties, geological layers of rocks are often interpreted as being transversely isotropic. Calculating the effective elastic properties of such layers in petrology has been coined Backus upscaling, which is described below.

#### Material Symmetry Matrix

The material matrix $\underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{K}}}$ has a symmetry with respect to a given orthogonal transformation (A) if it does not change when subjected to that transformation. 
For invariance of the material properties under such a transformation we require
$$
\boldsymbol{A}^T\boldsymbol{K}\boldsymbol{A} = \boldsymbol{K}
$$
Hence the condition for material symmetry under a transformation $\boldsymbol{A}$ is that the material matrix $\boldsymbol{K}$ commutes with $\boldsymbol{A}^T$. This condition can be extended to higher-order tensors, such as the elasticity tensor, by requiring that it commutes with the transformation tensor to the appropriate power.




### Subsection: 19.1b Orthorhombic Anisotropy

Orthorhombic anisotropy is another type of anisotropic media where the physical properties are symmetric about three mutually perpendicular axes. This type of material is also known as "cubic anisotropic" materials. In geophysics, cubic anisotropy is also known as vertical transverse isotropy (VTI).

This type of material exhibits cubic symmetry, so the number of independent constants in the (fourth-rank) elasticity tensor are reduced to 7 (from a total of 21 independent constants in the case of a fully anisotropic solid). The (second-rank) tensors of electrical resistivity, permeability, etc. have three independent constants.

#### Example of Orthorhombic Materials

An example of an orthorhombic material is the so-called on-axis unidirectional fiber composite lamina where the fibers are circular in cross section. In a unidirectional composite, the plane normal to the fiber direction can be considered as the isotropic plane, at long wavelengths (low frequencies) of excitation. In the figure to the right, the fibers would be aligned with the $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$ axes, which are mutually perpendicular.

In terms of effective properties, geological layers of rocks are often interpreted as being orthorhombic. Calculating the effective elastic properties of such layers in petrology has been coined Backus upscaling, which is described below.

#### Material Symmetry Matrix

The material matrix $\underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{K}}}$ has a symmetry with respect to a given orthogonal transformation (A) if it does not change when subjected to that transformation. 
For invariance of the material properties under such a transformation we require
$$
\boldsymbol{A}^T\boldsymbol{K}\boldsymbol{A} = \boldsymbol{K}
$$
Hence the condition for material symmetry under such a transformation is
$$
\boldsymbol{A}^T\boldsymbol{K}\boldsymbol{A} = \boldsymbol{K}
$$
This condition can be satisfied for an orthorhombic material if the transformation matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$ is such that it leaves the three mutually perpendicular axes invariant. This means that the transformation matrix can be written as
$$
\boldsymbol{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos(\theta_1) & \sin(\theta_1) & 0 \\
-\sin(\theta_1) & \cos(\theta_1) & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$
where $\theta_1$ is the angle between the $x_1$ and $x_2$ axes. This transformation matrix leaves the three mutually perpendicular axes invariant, and hence satisfies the condition for material symmetry.





### Subsection: 19.1c Monoclinic Anisotropy

Monoclinic anisotropy is a type of anisotropic media where the physical properties are symmetric about two mutually perpendicular axes. This type of material is also known as "uniaxial anisotropic" materials. In geophysics, uniaxial anisotropy is also known as vertical transverse isotropy (VTI).

This type of material exhibits uniaxial symmetry, so the number of independent constants in the (fourth-rank) elasticity tensor are reduced to 5 (from a total of 21 independent constants in the case of a fully anisotropic solid). The (second-rank) tensors of electrical resistivity, permeability, etc. have two independent constants.

#### Example of Monoclinic Materials

An example of a monoclinic material is the so-called on-axis unidirectional fiber composite lamina where the fibers are elliptical in cross section. In a unidirectional composite, the plane normal to the fiber direction can be considered as the isotropic plane, at long wavelengths (low frequencies) of excitation. In the figure to the right, the fibers would be aligned with the $x_1$ and $x_2$ axes, which are mutually perpendicular.

In terms of effective properties, geological layers of rocks are often interpreted as being monoclinic. Calculating the effective elastic properties of such layers in petrology has been coined Backus upscaling, which is described below.

#### Material Symmetry Matrix

The material matrix $\underline{\underline{\boldsymbol{K}}}$ has a symmetry with respect to a given orthogonal transformation (A) if it does not change when subjected to that transformation. 
For invariance of the material properties under such a transformation we require
$$
\boldsymbol{A}^T\boldsymbol{K}\boldsymbol{A} = \boldsymbol{K}
$$
Hence the condition for material symmetry under such a transformation is
$$
\boldsymbol{A}^T\boldsymbol{K}\boldsymbol{A} = \boldsymbol{K}
$$
This condition can be satisfied for a monoclinic material if the transform
$$
\boldsymbol{A} = \begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & 0 & \sin\theta \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
-\sin\theta & 0 & \cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}
$$
where $\theta$ is the angle between the $x_1$ and $x_3$ axes. This transformation leaves the material matrix $\boldsymbol{K}$ invariant, satisfying the condition for material symmetry.




### Subsection: 19.1d Triclinic Anisotropy

Triclinic anisotropy is a type of anisotropic media where the physical properties are not symmetric about any axis. This type of material is also known as "orthorhombic anisotropic" materials. In geophysics, triclinic anisotropy is also known as horizontal transverse isotropy (HTI).

This type of material exhibits orthorhombic symmetry, so the number of independent constants in the (fourth-rank) elasticity tensor are reduced to 7 (from a total of 21 independent constants in the case of a fully anisotropic solid). The (second-rank) tensors of electrical resistivity, permeability, etc. have three independent constants.

#### Example of Triclinic Materials

An example of a triclinic material is the so-called transversely isotropic fiber composite lamina where the fibers are elliptical in cross section. In a transversely isotropic composite, the plane normal to the fiber direction can be considered as the isotropic plane, at long wavelengths (low frequencies) of excitation. In the figure to the right, the fibers would be aligned with the $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$ axes, which are mutually perpendicular.

In terms of effective properties, geological layers of rocks are often interpreted as being triclinic. Calculating the effective elastic properties of such layers in petrology has been coined Backus upscaling, which is described below.

## Chapter: - Chapter 20: Seismic Monitoring:




### Section: 20.1 Time-lapse Seismic:

Time-lapse seismic, also known as 4D seismic, is a powerful tool for monitoring changes in the Earth's subsurface over time. It is a technique that involves repeating a 3D seismic survey at regular intervals, typically over the course of several years, to observe how the subsurface changes due to various processes such as oil and gas extraction, groundwater depletion, or natural geological phenomena.

#### 20.1a 4D Seismic Monitoring

4D seismic monitoring is a crucial tool in the oil and gas industry, where it is used to monitor the effects of reservoir depletion and to optimize extraction processes. The technique involves acquiring a baseline 3D seismic survey of the reservoir before extraction begins, and then repeating the survey at regular intervals to observe changes in the subsurface.

The changes observed in the 4D seismic data can provide valuable insights into the state of the reservoir. For example, the changes in seismic amplitude can indicate the presence of hydrocarbons, while changes in seismic velocity can provide information about the porosity and permeability of the reservoir. By comparing the baseline survey with the repeat surveys, geophysicists can identify areas of the reservoir where extraction is affecting the subsurface, and adjust extraction processes accordingly.

4D seismic monitoring is also used in other industries, such as geothermal energy production and carbon capture and storage. In these industries, 4D seismic can provide valuable information about the state of the reservoir and help optimize extraction processes.

One of the key advantages of 4D seismic monitoring is its ability to provide real-time data. This allows for rapid response to changes in the subsurface, which can be crucial in industries where extraction processes need to be adjusted quickly.

However, 4D seismic monitoring also has its limitations. The technique relies on the assumption that the subsurface is homogeneous and isotropic, which is often not the case in real-world scenarios. This can lead to errors in the interpretation of the 4D data.

Despite its limitations, 4D seismic monitoring remains a powerful tool for near-surface geophysical imaging. Its ability to provide real-time data and its applications in various industries make it an essential topic for any advanced undergraduate course in geophysics.





### Section: 20.1b Difference Imaging

Difference imaging is a powerful technique used in seismic monitoring to detect changes in the subsurface over time. It involves comparing two or more seismic surveys, typically taken at different times, to identify areas where the subsurface has changed. This technique is particularly useful in the oil and gas industry, where it can help identify areas of the reservoir where extraction is affecting the subsurface.

#### 20.1b.1 Time-Lapse Difference Imaging

Time-lapse difference imaging is a variant of difference imaging that involves comparing two or more seismic surveys taken at different times. This technique is particularly useful in the oil and gas industry, where it can help identify areas of the reservoir where extraction is affecting the subsurface.

The process of time-lapse difference imaging involves several steps. First, a baseline seismic survey is acquired before extraction begins. This survey provides a snapshot of the subsurface at a specific point in time. Then, repeat surveys are acquired at regular intervals to monitor changes in the subsurface.

The repeat surveys are then compared to the baseline survey to identify areas where the subsurface has changed. This can be done using various techniques, such as amplitude comparison, velocity comparison, or difference imaging.

Amplitude comparison involves comparing the amplitude of the seismic signal at different points in the subsurface. Changes in amplitude can indicate the presence of hydrocarbons, while changes in velocity can provide information about the porosity and permeability of the reservoir.

Velocity comparison involves comparing the velocity of the seismic signal at different points in the subsurface. Changes in velocity can indicate changes in the subsurface, such as the presence of hydrocarbons or changes in the porosity and permeability of the reservoir.

Difference imaging involves comparing the seismic signal at different points in the subsurface. This can be done using various techniques, such as amplitude difference imaging, velocity difference imaging, or time-lapse difference imaging.

#### 20.1b.2 Applications of Difference Imaging

Difference imaging has a wide range of applications in the oil and gas industry. It can be used to monitor changes in the subsurface due to extraction processes, such as oil and gas extraction, groundwater depletion, and natural geological phenomena.

In the oil and gas industry, difference imaging is used to optimize extraction processes. By monitoring changes in the subsurface, geophysicists can identify areas where extraction is affecting the subsurface and adjust extraction processes accordingly.

In addition to the oil and gas industry, difference imaging is also used in other industries, such as geothermal energy production and carbon capture and storage. In these industries, difference imaging can provide valuable information about the state of the reservoir and help optimize extraction processes.

#### 20.1b.3 Limitations of Difference Imaging

While difference imaging is a powerful technique, it does have some limitations. One of the main limitations is that it relies on the assumption that the subsurface is homogeneous and isotropic. If this assumption is not valid, the results of difference imaging may be inaccurate.

Another limitation of difference imaging is that it can be affected by noise and other sources of error. This can make it difficult to accurately interpret the results of difference imaging and can lead to incorrect conclusions about the state of the subsurface.

Despite these limitations, difference imaging remains a valuable tool in seismic monitoring and can provide valuable insights into the state of the subsurface over time. With careful interpretation and validation, it can be a powerful tool for optimizing extraction processes in the oil and gas industry.





### Subsection: 20.1c Reservoir Monitoring

Reservoir monitoring is a critical aspect of the oil and gas industry. It involves the continuous or periodic monitoring of reservoirs to assess their health and performance. This is crucial for optimizing extraction processes, identifying potential issues, and making informed decisions about future operations.

#### 20.1c.1 Importance of Reservoir Monitoring

Reservoir monitoring is essential for several reasons. Firstly, it allows for the early detection of changes in the reservoir, such as the movement of hydrocarbons or changes in pressure. This can help identify potential issues before they become significant, allowing for timely intervention and minimizing losses.

Secondly, reservoir monitoring can provide valuable data for reservoir management and optimization. By continuously monitoring the reservoir, operators can track changes in the reservoir's health and performance over time. This can help identify trends and patterns, which can be used to optimize extraction processes and improve reservoir performance.

Finally, reservoir monitoring can help with the planning and execution of future operations. By providing a detailed understanding of the reservoir's current state, operators can make informed decisions about future extraction plans, well placement, and other operational strategies.

#### 20.1c.2 Techniques for Reservoir Monitoring

There are several techniques for reservoir monitoring, each with its own advantages and limitations. These include:

- **Seismic monitoring**: As discussed in the previous section, seismic monitoring is a powerful technique for monitoring reservoirs. It involves creating seismic waves that propagate through the reservoir, reflecting back from the reservoir's boundaries. The reflected waves are then recorded by seismic sensors, providing a detailed image of the reservoir's structure and changes over time.

- **Pressure monitoring**: Pressure monitoring involves measuring the pressure at different points in the reservoir. Changes in pressure can indicate the movement of hydrocarbons or changes in the reservoir's health.

- **Temperature monitoring**: Temperature monitoring involves measuring the temperature at different points in the reservoir. Changes in temperature can provide information about the reservoir's thermal properties and the movement of hydrocarbons.

- **Geochemical monitoring**: Geochemical monitoring involves analyzing the chemical composition of the reservoir's fluids. This can provide valuable information about the reservoir's composition and changes over time.

#### 20.1c.3 Case Studies of Reservoir Monitoring

To further illustrate the importance and effectiveness of reservoir monitoring, let's look at two case studies: the Sleipner sequestration project and the CO2CRC Otway Project.

The Sleipner sequestration project, located in the North Sea, is one of the world's largest carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) storage projects. The project involves injecting CO<sub>2</sub> into a depleted gas reservoir. Seismic monitoring has been used to track the movement of the CO<sub>2</sub> plume and confirm its presence in the reservoir. This has been crucial for monitoring the effectiveness of the sequestration process and identifying any potential issues.

The CO2CRC Otway Project, located off the coast of Australia, is another example of a project that has used seismic monitoring for reservoir monitoring. In this project, CO<sub>2</sub> is injected into an oil reservoir for enhanced oil recovery. Seismic monitoring has been used to track the movement of the CO<sub>2</sub> plume and identify any potential issues. This has been crucial for optimizing the extraction process and ensuring the safety of the project.

In conclusion, reservoir monitoring is a critical aspect of the oil and gas industry. It allows for the early detection of changes in the reservoir, provides valuable data for reservoir management and optimization, and helps with the planning and execution of future operations. Seismic monitoring, in particular, has proven to be a powerful technique for reservoir monitoring, as demonstrated by the Sleipner sequestration project and the CO2CRC Otway Project.




### Subsection: 20.1d CO2 Sequestration Monitoring

Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) sequestration is a critical aspect of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. It involves the injection of CO<sub>2</sub> into geological formations for long-term storage. Monitoring the effectiveness of CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of this technology.

#### 20.1d.1 Importance of CO2 Sequestration Monitoring

CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration monitoring is essential for several reasons. Firstly, it allows for the early detection of leaks, which can lead to the loss of stored CO<sub>2</sub>. This can help prevent significant losses and minimize the environmental impact of any leakage.

Secondly, CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration monitoring can provide valuable data for the optimization of CO<sub>2</sub> injection processes. By continuously monitoring the injection and storage of CO<sub>2</sub>, operators can track changes in the sequestration process over time. This can help identify trends and patterns, which can be used to optimize the injection process and improve the efficiency of CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration.

Finally, CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration monitoring can help with the planning and execution of future CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration projects. By providing a detailed understanding of the current state of CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration, operators can make informed decisions about future projects, well placement, and other operational strategies.

#### 20.1d.2 Techniques for CO2 Sequestration Monitoring

There are several techniques for CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration monitoring, each with its own advantages and limitations. These include:

- **Seismic monitoring**: As discussed in the previous section, seismic monitoring is a powerful technique for monitoring reservoirs. It can also be used to monitor CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration by creating seismic waves that propagate through the sequestration formation, reflecting back from the CO<sub>2</sub> plume. The reflected waves can then be recorded by seismic sensors, providing a detailed image of the CO<sub>2</sub> plume and changes over time.

- **Pressure monitoring**: Pressure monitoring involves measuring the pressure changes in the sequestration formation. Changes in pressure can indicate the presence of CO<sub>2</sub> and the movement of the CO<sub>2</sub> plume.
