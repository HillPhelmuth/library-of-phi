## Foreward

Welcome to "Introduction to Computers in Public Management II". This book is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of computers in public management, with a specific focus on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in policy making and implementation.

As we delve deeper into the world of public policy, it is important to understand the role of AI in this realm. AI has been used in recent years by public administrators to deliver services and for the general improvement of government operations. In the realm of policy making in the public sector, AI will also be used to optimize outcome forecasting, pattern perception, and most importantly for the development of evidence-based programs to generate sound policy.

However, the use of AI in public policy making and implementation is not without its challenges. One of the key concerns is the concept of "algorithmic bias". Algorithmic bias can cause the government use of AI to have errors in decision making and create distrust in government entities. This is a critical issue that we will explore in depth in this book.

In addition to AI, we will also explore the role of computers in public management more broadly. This includes the use of computers in e-governance, where they are used as tools for virtual assistance on government websites and the automation of public online services. This not only frees public employees from mundane tasks, but also improves the efficiency and effectiveness of government operations.

As we navigate through this book, we will also discuss the academic discipline of public policy. This discipline brings in elements of many social science fields and concepts, including economics, sociology, political economy, social policy, program evaluation, policy analysis, and public management. The study of public policy is distinct from political science or economics, in its focus on the application of theory to practice.

In conclusion, this book aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of computers in public management, with a specific focus on the use of AI in policy making and implementation. We hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for students, researchers, and practitioners in the field of public policy.

### Study 1: A microspatial analysis of robbery

A study that uses nearest neighbor index (NNI), and STAC Ellipses was completed for the City of Roanoke, Virginia. The study focuses on data reported to police on robberies that occurred between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2007, with a total of 904 robberies reported. The purpose of this study was to determine if there were localized areas of robberies using hotspot analysis. The project first began by geo-coding all data onto a pinpoint map. The records of all robbery data came from the cities records and management system. After receiving satisfying results from geocoding the data, the data was then tested for global and spatial clustering. To test for spatial randomness, NNI was employed. For each year, 2004–2007, NNI was calculated and compared to a set of random points. Each year presents a NNI value of less than one. A value less than one, according to <harvp|Eck|Chainey|Cameron|Wilson|2005> signifies that the clustering in the data set is consistent in its distribution. <harv|Van Patten|McKeldin-Coner|Cox|2009>. concluded that the data set has significant global spatial clustering that applies to the entire study population.

Following the testing of random clustering, using NNI hotspot analysis, was employed in the study. The study examined hotspot using many different spatial analysis techniques. The study used nearest neighbor hierarchal clustering (NNH) and other kernel density estimation (KDE). The following will look at the analysis of STAC ellipses in further details for the purpose of this section. Ellipses were developed for each year and then were further examined using different techniques. To create the ellipses, parameter settings were made based on the distance a person can travel on foot in approximately five minutes before looking for another form of transportation. This was done to ensure that the ellipses accurately represented the areas of high crime activity.

### Subsection: 2.1b Case Study: Crime Analysis

In this subsection, we will delve deeper into the case study of crime analysis using analytic mapping. As mentioned earlier, the study used nearest neighbor index (NNI) and STAC Ellipses to analyze robbery data in the City of Roanoke, Virginia. The results of this study were significant, as it was able to identify localized areas of robberies, known as hotspots, using hotspot analysis.

The study first began by geo-coding all data onto a pinpoint map. This involved using the city's records and management system to obtain the necessary data on robberies. After receiving satisfying results from geocoding the data, the data was then tested for global and spatial clustering. This was done to ensure that the data was accurate and reliable for further analysis.

To test for spatial randomness, NNI was employed. NNI is a statistical measure that compares the clustering in a data set to a set of random points. The results of the NNI test showed that the data set had significant global spatial clustering, meaning that there were localized areas of robberies in the city.

Following the testing of random clustering, hotspot analysis was employed using NNI. This involved examining the data for hotspots, or areas of high crime activity. The study used nearest neighbor hierarchal clustering (NNH) and other spatial analysis techniques to identify these hotspots. The results of the hotspot analysis were then further examined using different techniques, such as kernel density estimation (KDE).

To create the ellipses used in the study, parameter settings were made based on the distance a person can travel on foot in approximately five minutes before looking for another form of transportation. This was done to ensure that the ellipses accurately represented the areas of high crime activity.

The results of the study showed that there were significant hotspots of robberies in the city, with the majority occurring in the downtown area. This information was crucial for the police in making strategic decisions to combat crime in the city. By targeting these hotspots, the police were able to reduce the overall crime rate and improve public safety.

In conclusion, the use of analytic mapping in crime analysis has proven to be a valuable tool in public management. By visualizing and analyzing data, we can gain a better understanding of complex systems and make informed decisions to improve public safety. The case study of crime analysis in the City of Roanoke, Virginia serves as a prime example of the effectiveness of analytic mapping in public management.
