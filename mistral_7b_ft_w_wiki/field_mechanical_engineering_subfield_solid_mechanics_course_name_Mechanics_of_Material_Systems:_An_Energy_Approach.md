## Chapter 1: Energy Methods in Structural Mechanics




### Introduction

In the study of mechanics, understanding the behavior of material systems is crucial. This behavior is often characterized by deformation and strain, which are fundamental concepts in the field. In this chapter, we will delve into the intricacies of deformation and strain, exploring their definitions, types, and the relationship between them.

Deformation refers to the change in shape or size of a material system under the influence of external forces. It is a critical concept in mechanics as it helps us understand how materials respond to different types of forces. Deformation can be categorized into two types: elastic deformation and plastic deformation. Elastic deformation is a temporary change in shape or size that is reversible upon the removal of the applied forces. On the other hand, plastic deformation is a permanent change in shape or size that occurs when the material reaches its yield point.

Strain, on the other hand, is a measure of deformation representing the displacement between particles in the material body. It is a dimensionless quantity and is a key parameter in understanding the mechanical behavior of materials. Strain can be further classified into three types: normal strain, shear strain, and volumetric strain. Normal strain and shear strain are measures of deformation in the direction of the applied force and perpendicular to it, respectively. Volumetric strain, on the other hand, is a measure of the change in volume of a material system.

The relationship between deformation and strain is a crucial aspect of mechanics. The strain of a material system is directly proportional to its deformation, as described by Hooke's Law. This relationship is fundamental in understanding the mechanical behavior of materials and is the basis for many engineering applications.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these concepts, exploring their mathematical representations, the factors influencing them, and their applications in various fields. By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of deformation and strain, and their role in the mechanics of material systems.




### Section: 1.1 Description of Finite Deformation:

#### 1.1a Basic Concepts

In the previous section, we introduced the fundamental concepts of deformation and strain. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of finite deformation, which is a crucial aspect of mechanics.

Finite deformation refers to the permanent change in shape or size of a material system under the influence of external forces. Unlike elastic deformation, which is a temporary change, finite deformation is a permanent change that occurs when the material reaches its yield point. This is a critical concept in mechanics as it helps us understand the behavior of materials under extreme conditions.

The concept of finite deformation is closely related to the concept of strain. As we have seen, strain is a measure of deformation representing the displacement between particles in the material body. In the case of finite deformation, the strain is permanent and represents the permanent change in shape or size of the material system.

The relationship between deformation and strain is a crucial aspect of mechanics. The strain of a material system is directly proportional to its deformation, as described by Hooke's Law. This relationship is fundamental in understanding the mechanical behavior of materials and is the basis for many engineering applications.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of finite deformation and their characteristics. We will also discuss the mathematical representations of these types of deformation and their implications in the field of mechanics.

#### 1.1b Types of Deformation

There are three main types of deformation: elastic deformation, plastic deformation, and viscoelastic deformation. 

Elastic deformation, as we have discussed, is a temporary change in shape or size that is reversible upon the removal of the applied forces. This type of deformation is governed by Hooke's Law, which states that the strain of a material is directly proportional to the applied stress. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$$
\sigma = E \epsilon
$$

where $\sigma$ is the stress, $E$ is the modulus of elasticity, and $\epsilon$ is the strain.

Plastic deformation, on the other hand, is a permanent change in shape or size that occurs when the material reaches its yield point. Beyond this point, the material will deform permanently under the applied stress, even if the stress is below the yield point. This type of deformation is characterized by a non-linear relationship between stress and strain, and is often described using a yield criterion.

Viscoelastic deformation is a combination of both elastic and plastic deformation. It is characterized by a time-dependent deformation under a constant stress, or a stress-dependent deformation under a constant time. This type of deformation is common in materials such as polymers and biological tissues.

In the next section, we will explore the mathematical representations of these types of deformation and their implications in the field of mechanics.

#### 1.1c Deformation Mechanisms

Deformation in material systems is a result of various mechanisms. These mechanisms can be broadly categorized into two types: slip and twinning. 

Slip is the most common deformation mechanism in crystalline materials. It occurs when dislocations move through the crystal lattice, causing the material to deform. The direction of the applied stress and the orientation of the crystal lattice determine the direction of the slip. The strain produced by slip is directly proportional to the applied stress, as described by Hooke's Law.

Twinning, on the other hand, is a deformation mechanism that occurs in some crystalline materials. It involves the formation of a mirror image of the crystal lattice, resulting in a change in the shape or size of the material. Twinning is less common than slip, but it can produce significant deformation in certain materials.

The deformation mechanisms in a material system can be represented mathematically using the strain tensor. The strain tensor, denoted by $\epsilon_{ij}$, is a second-order tensor that describes the deformation of a material system. It is defined as:

$$
\epsilon_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j} + \frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i} \right)
$$

where $u_i$ and $u_j$ are the displacement vectors in the $i$ and $j$ directions, respectively, and $x_i$ and $x_j$ are the coordinates in the $i$ and $j$ directions, respectively.

The strain tensor is symmetric, meaning that $\epsilon_{ij} = \epsilon_{ji}$. This symmetry is a result of the physical interpretation of the strain tensor as a measure of deformation. The diagonal elements of the strain tensor, $\epsilon_{ii}$, represent the normal strains, while the off-diagonal elements represent the shear strains.

In the next section, we will explore the relationship between the strain tensor and the deformation mechanisms in more detail.

#### 1.1b Types of Deformation

There are three main types of deformation: elastic deformation, plastic deformation, and viscoelastic deformation.

This type of deformation is governed by Hooke's Law, which states that the strain of a material is directly proportional to the applied stress. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

Plastic deformation, on the other hand, is a permanent change in shape or size that occurs when the material reaches its yield point. Beyond this point, the material will deform permanently, even if the applied forces are removed. The yield point is a critical concept in mechanics, as it represents the point at which a material begins to deform permanently.

Viscoelastic deformation is a combination of both elastic and plastic deformation. It occurs in materials that exhibit both elastic and plastic properties, such as polymers. Viscoelastic deformation is time-dependent, meaning that the deformation will continue to increase over time, even if the applied forces are constant.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical representations of these types of deformation and their implications in the field of mechanics.
