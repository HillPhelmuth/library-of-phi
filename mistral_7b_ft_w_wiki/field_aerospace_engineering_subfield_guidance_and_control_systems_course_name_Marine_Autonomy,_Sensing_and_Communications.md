MOOS is a distributed system that allows for the coordination and communication of multiple autonomous systems. It is based on a client-server architecture, with a central server that manages the communication between clients. This allows for scalability and flexibility in system design.

#### 4.1a.2 Programming in MOOS

MOOS is written in C++ and uses a custom programming language called MOOSL (MOOS Language). MOOSL is a simple and easy-to-learn language that is designed for use in real-time systems. It is similar to C++ in syntax and structure, but also includes features specifically designed for use in MOOS, such as support for distributed systems and real-time programming.

The development environment for MOOS is based on the Eclipse IDE, with additional tools and plugins for MOOS-specific tasks. This allows for a familiar and user-friendly development experience for programmers.

#### 4.1a.3 Components of MOOS

MOOS is composed of several key components that work together to provide a complete system for marine autonomy, sensing, and communications. These components include:

- MOOS Database: This is a centralized database that stores all data and information for the system. It is used for data storage, retrieval, and sharing between different components of the system.
- MOOS Bus: This is a communication protocol that allows for the exchange of data between different components of the system. It is used for real-time communication and is designed for use in noisy and unreliable communication environments.
- MOOS Client-Server Architecture: This is the backbone of the MOOS system. It consists of a central server that manages communication between clients and allows for scalability and flexibility in system design.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the programming aspects of MOOS and discuss how to develop applications using MOOSL. We will also cover the various tools and techniques for debugging and testing MOOS applications.





### Subsection: 4.1b Basic Programming in MOOS

In this section, we will delve into the basics of programming in MOOS. We will cover the fundamental concepts and techniques that are essential for writing MOOS programs.

#### 4.1b.1 MOOS Architecture

The architecture of MOOS is based on a client-server model. The server, known as the MOOS Server, is responsible for managing the communication between clients. The clients, which can be other servers or individual programs, communicate with the server to exchange data and commands.

The MOOS Server is also responsible for managing the MOOS Database, which is a central repository for all data in the system. The database is organized into tables, each of which represents a specific type of data. For example, there may be a table for storing sensor readings, another for storing control commands, and so on.

#### 4.1b.2 MOOS Language (MOOSL)

As mentioned earlier, MOOS uses a custom programming language called MOOSL. This language is designed for use in real-time systems and is similar to C++ in syntax and structure. However, it also includes features specifically designed for use in MOOS, such as support for distributed systems and real-time programming.

MOOSL is a simple and easy-to-learn language. It supports basic data types, control structures, and functions. It also includes a number of built-in functions for working with the MOOS Database and communicating with other clients.

#### 4.1b.3 Programming in MOOS

To write a MOOS program, you first need to create a MOOSL file. This file contains the source code for your program. The file should be saved in a directory that is accessible to the MOOS Server.

Once the file is saved, you can run the program by issuing a command to the MOOS Server. The exact command depends on the specific implementation of MOOS, but it typically involves specifying the name of the program and the directory where it is located.

When the program is run, it will be loaded into the MOOS Server and executed. The program can then communicate with other clients and access data from the MOOS Database.

#### 4.1b.4 Example Program

To illustrate the basic concepts of programming in MOOS, let's consider a simple example program. This program will read sensor data from the MOOS Database and print it to the console.

```
// Example program in MOOSL

// Read sensor data from the MOOS Database
read_sensor_data();

// Print the data to the console
print_data();
```

This program assumes that there is a table in the MOOS Database called "sensor_data" that contains the sensor readings. The "read_sensor_data" function is a built-in function that retrieves the data from the database. The "print_data" function is a user-defined function that prints the data to the console.

#### 4.1b.5 Conclusion

In this section, we have covered the basics of programming in MOOS. We have discussed the architecture of MOOS, the MOOS Language (MOOSL), and the process of writing and running a MOOS program. In the next section, we will delve deeper into the programming aspects of MOOS and explore more advanced concepts and techniques.

### Section: 6.1 Intro to Helm Autonomy:

The IvP Helm is a crucial component of the IvP project, responsible for controlling the behavior of marine vehicles. It is a software system that utilizes the principles of Behavior-Based Robotics to enable marine vehicles to perform complex tasks in a dynamic and unpredictable marine environment.

#### 6.1a Introduction to Behavior-Based Robotics

Behavior-Based Robotics (BBR) is a field that focuses on creating robots that can perform complex tasks by mimicking the behavior of living organisms. This approach has been widely used in marine robotics due to its ability to handle the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the marine environment.

The key principle behind BBR is the concept of behavior. Behavior is defined as the observable actions of a robot in response to its environment. These actions are not pre-programmed, but rather learned through interaction with the environment. This allows the robot to adapt to changing conditions and perform complex tasks in a dynamic environment.

The IvP Helm utilizes BBR to control the behavior of marine vehicles. It is programmed with a basic set of features, including obstacle avoidance and battery charging, to help the vehicles navigate and perform tasks. These features are dictated by a behavioral repertoire, which determines what behaviors to use and when.

One of the key advantages of BBR is its ability to handle the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the marine environment. Marine vehicles often operate in environments with changing conditions, such as currents, waves, and obstacles. BBR allows the vehicles to adapt to these changes and perform tasks effectively.

However, BBR also has its limitations. It relies heavily on the robot's sensors to gather information about its environment. This can be challenging in environments with limited sensor coverage or in situations where the sensors are not functioning properly. Additionally, BBR can lead to a lack of global planning, as the robot's actions are based solely on its immediate environment.

Despite these limitations, BBR has been successfully applied in various marine robotics applications, including underwater exploration, surveillance, and search and rescue operations. Its ability to handle dynamic and unpredictable environments makes it a valuable tool for marine autonomy.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the principles and techniques behind the IvP Helm and its role in marine autonomy. We will also discuss its applications in marine robotics and how it is used to control the behavior of marine vehicles.

This can be challenging in environments with limited sensor coverage or in situations where the sensors are not functioning properly. Additionally, BBR can lead to a lack of global planning, as the robot's behavior is based on immediate sensory information and does not consider long-term goals.

To address these limitations, researchers have developed various techniques for improving the performance of BBR systems. One such technique is the use of artificial intuition, which allows the robot to make decisions based on past experiences and learned patterns. This can help the robot to handle situations where its sensors may not provide enough information, or where the environment is constantly changing.

Another approach is the use of hierarchical BBR, where the robot's behavior is organized into different levels of complexity. This allows for more efficient and effective decision-making, as higher-level behaviors can take into account the outcomes of lower-level behaviors.

In addition to these techniques, researchers are also exploring the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence to improve the performance of BBR systems. These approaches can help the robot to learn from its experiences and adapt to changing environments, making it more efficient and effective in performing complex tasks.

Overall, the use of BBR in marine autonomy has shown great potential in handling the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the marine environment. With continued research and development, it is expected that BBR will play a crucial role in the future of marine robotics.

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamentals of marine autonomy, sensing, and communications. We have discussed the basic principles, technologies, and applications of these concepts. However, as the field of marine autonomy continues to advance, there is a growing need for more complex and sophisticated systems. This is where the concept of nested autonomy comes into play.

The nested autonomy paradigm is a novel approach to designing and implementing marine autonomous systems. It is based on the idea of creating a hierarchy of autonomous agents, each with its own set of tasks and responsibilities. This allows for a more efficient and effective management of complex systems, as well as the ability to handle dynamic and uncertain environments.

In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the concept of nested autonomy and explore its various aspects. We will discuss the principles behind nested autonomy, its advantages and limitations, and its applications in marine autonomy.

As we continue to push the boundaries of marine autonomy, the nested autonomy paradigm will play a crucial role in shaping the future of this field. It will enable us to create more advanced and capable autonomous systems, paving the way for a more sustainable and efficient use of our oceans. So let us embark on this journey together and explore the exciting world of nested autonomy in marine autonomy.




### Subsection: 8.1a Introduction to Nested Autonomy Paradigm

The nested autonomy paradigm is a revolutionary approach to designing and implementing marine autonomous systems. It is based on the concept of creating a hierarchy of autonomous agents, each with its own set of tasks and responsibilities. This allows for a more efficient and effective management of complex systems, as well as the ability to handle dynamic and uncertain environments.

The nested autonomy paradigm is a natural extension of the traditional single-vehicle autonomy approach. In single-vehicle autonomy, a single agent is responsible for all tasks and decisions. However, as systems become more complex and dynamic, this approach becomes increasingly difficult to manage. The nested autonomy paradigm addresses this issue by breaking down the system into smaller, more manageable subsystems, each with its own autonomous agent.

The concept of nested autonomy is based on the idea of delegation and division of tasks. In a nested system, higher-level agents are responsible for overseeing and coordinating lower-level agents. This allows for a more efficient and effective management of tasks, as each agent is only responsible for a specific set of tasks.

One of the key advantages of the nested autonomy paradigm is its ability to handle dynamic and uncertain environments. In traditional single-vehicle autonomy, a system may struggle to adapt to changes in the environment or unexpected events. However, in a nested system, each agent is responsible for a specific task, and can adapt to changes in their own environment. This allows for a more robust and resilient system.

The nested autonomy paradigm also allows for scalability and flexibility. As systems become more complex and dynamic, the number and complexity of agents can be increased to handle the additional tasks and responsibilities. This allows for the system to adapt and grow as needed.

In the next section, we will explore the principles behind nested autonomy and how it can be applied in marine autonomy. We will also discuss the advantages and limitations of this approach, as well as its potential applications. 





### Subsection: 8.1b Basic Nested Autonomy Paradigm

The nested autonomy paradigm is a powerful approach to designing and implementing marine autonomous systems. It allows for a more efficient and effective management of complex systems, as well as the ability to handle dynamic and uncertain environments. In this section, we will explore the basic principles behind the nested autonomy paradigm and how it can be applied to marine autonomous systems.

#### 8.1b.1 Principles of Nested Autonomy

The nested autonomy paradigm is based on the concept of delegation and division of tasks. In a nested system, higher-level agents are responsible for overseeing and coordinating lower-level agents. This allows for a more efficient and effective management of tasks, as each agent is only responsible for a specific set of tasks.

The nested autonomy paradigm also allows for scalability and flexibility. As systems become more complex and dynamic, the number and complexity of agents can be increased to handle the additional tasks and responsibilities. This allows for the system to adapt and grow as needed.

#### 8.1b.2 Implementing Nested Autonomy in Marine Autonomous Systems

The nested autonomy paradigm can be applied to marine autonomous systems in a variety of ways. One common approach is to use a hierarchical structure, where higher-level agents are responsible for overseeing and coordinating lower-level agents. This allows for a more efficient and effective management of tasks, as each agent is only responsible for a specific set of tasks.

Another approach is to use a decentralized system, where each agent is responsible for a specific task and communicates with other agents to coordinate their actions. This allows for a more flexible and adaptable system, as each agent can make decisions based on their own information and communicate with other agents to coordinate their actions.

#### 8.1b.3 Challenges and Considerations

While the nested autonomy paradigm offers many advantages, there are also some challenges and considerations to keep in mind. One challenge is the potential for communication and coordination issues between agents. As systems become more complex and dynamic, ensuring effective communication and coordination between agents can be a challenge.

Another consideration is the need for robust and reliable sensors and communication systems. In order for nested autonomy to be effective, marine autonomous systems must be equipped with sensors and communication systems that can accurately and reliably gather and transmit information. This requires careful design and testing to ensure the system's performance and reliability.

#### 8.1b.4 Future Directions

The nested autonomy paradigm is a rapidly evolving field, and there are many opportunities for future research and development. One area of interest is the integration of artificial intuition into nested autonomy systems. Artificial intuition, which allows for decision-making based on intuition rather than explicit knowledge, could greatly enhance the capabilities of marine autonomous systems.

Another direction for future research is the development of more advanced learning algorithms for nested autonomy systems. These algorithms could allow for more efficient and effective learning and adaptation, leading to improved performance in dynamic and uncertain environments.

In conclusion, the nested autonomy paradigm offers a powerful approach to designing and implementing marine autonomous systems. By delegating and dividing tasks, allowing for scalability and flexibility, and incorporating advanced learning algorithms, nested autonomy can greatly enhance the capabilities of marine autonomous systems. As technology continues to advance, the potential for nested autonomy in marine applications is vast.





### Subsection: 8.1c Advanced Nested Autonomy Paradigm

In the previous section, we discussed the basic principles and implementation of the nested autonomy paradigm in marine autonomous systems. In this section, we will explore some advanced concepts and techniques that can be used to further enhance the capabilities of nested autonomy.

#### 8.1c.1 Advanced Delegation and Division of Tasks

In the basic nested autonomy paradigm, higher-level agents are responsible for overseeing and coordinating lower-level agents. However, in more complex systems, it may be beneficial to have multiple levels of agents, with each level responsible for a different set of tasks. This allows for a more granular and specialized management of tasks, leading to improved efficiency and effectiveness.

#### 8.1c.2 Dynamic Adaptation and Learning

One of the key advantages of nested autonomy is its ability to adapt and grow as needed. This can be further enhanced by incorporating dynamic adaptation and learning techniques. For example, agents can learn from their experiences and adjust their behavior and tasks in response to changing environments or goals. This allows for a more flexible and adaptable system.

#### 8.1c.3 Collaborative Problem Solving

In addition to delegation and division of tasks, the nested autonomy paradigm can also be used for collaborative problem solving. By having multiple agents working together towards a common goal, complex tasks can be broken down and solved more efficiently. This can be particularly useful in marine autonomous systems, where tasks may be highly complex and require the coordination of multiple agents.

#### 8.1c.4 Integration with Other Technologies

The nested autonomy paradigm can also be integrated with other technologies, such as artificial intuition and lifelong planning A*. This allows for a more holistic approach to autonomous systems, where different technologies work together to achieve a common goal. For example, artificial intuition can be used to make decisions and plan tasks, while lifelong planning A* can be used for long-term goal planning and adaptation.

#### 8.1c.5 Ethical Considerations

As with any technology, there are ethical considerations that must be taken into account when implementing nested autonomy in marine autonomous systems. This includes issues such as accountability, transparency, and potential biases in decision-making. It is important to carefully consider these ethical implications and address them in the design and implementation of nested autonomy systems.

In conclusion, the nested autonomy paradigm is a powerful approach to designing and implementing marine autonomous systems. By incorporating advanced concepts and techniques, such as dynamic adaptation, collaborative problem solving, and integration with other technologies, the capabilities of nested autonomy can be further enhanced. However, it is important to also consider and address ethical implications to ensure responsible and ethical use of this technology.

#### 9.1b Basic Autonomous Collaborative Search

The basic principle of Autonomous Collaborative Search (ACS) involves the coordination of multiple autonomous vehicles to achieve a common goal. This is achieved through a combination of hardware, software, and algorithms. The hardware includes sensors, communication devices, and processing units. The software includes operating systems, control algorithms, and communication protocols. The algorithms are used for tasks such as target detection, tracking, and task allocation.

The basic ACS process begins with the initialization of the search area. This is typically done by defining a search region and dividing it into smaller subregions. Each subregion is then assigned to a specific autonomous vehicle. The vehicles then start searching their assigned subregions simultaneously.

As the vehicles search their assigned subregions, they communicate with each other to share information about their findings. This information can include the presence of targets, the location of these targets, and the quality of the information. This information is then used to update the search area and adjust the search strategy.

The search continues until all the subregions have been searched or until a certain condition is met. This condition could be the detection of a target, the exhaustion of resources, or a predefined time limit. Once the condition is met, the vehicles coordinate to report their findings and terminate the search.

The basic ACS process can be represented mathematically as follows:

Let $N$ be the number of vehicles, $R$ be the search region, and $S_i$ be the subregion assigned to vehicle $i$. The search process can be represented as:

$$
\forall i \in \{1, ..., N\}: S_i \subseteq R
$$

The communication process can be represented as:

$$
\forall i, j \in \{1, ..., N\}: i \neq j \Rightarrow C_{ij} \subseteq S_i \cap S_j
$$

where $C_{ij}$ is the communication area between vehicles $i$ and $j$.

The update process can be represented as:

$$
\forall i \in \{1, ..., N\}: U_i \subseteq S_i \setminus C_i
$$

where $U_i$ is the updated search area for vehicle $i$.

The termination process can be represented as:

$$
\exists i \in \{1, ..., N\}: T_i = true
$$

where $T_i$ is the termination condition for vehicle $i$.

In the next section, we will discuss the various aspects of ACS in more detail, including the communication protocols used, the algorithms for task allocation and coordination, and the challenges associated with operating in a dynamic and unpredictable marine environment.

#### 9.1c Advanced Autonomous Collaborative Search

Advanced Autonomous Collaborative Search (ACS) builds upon the basic principles of ACS, incorporating more complex algorithms and strategies to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the search process. This section will delve into the advanced aspects of ACS, including advanced search strategies, advanced communication protocols, and advanced task allocation algorithms.

##### Advanced Search Strategies

Advanced search strategies in ACS involve the use of more sophisticated algorithms for target detection, tracking, and task allocation. These algorithms can be based on machine learning techniques, such as neural networks or decision trees, which can learn from past experiences and adapt to changing conditions. For example, a neural network can be trained to detect targets based on a combination of sensor data, such as acoustics, imagery, and infrared.

Another advanced search strategy is the use of implicit data structures, which can be used to represent and process large amounts of data efficiently. These structures can be particularly useful in ACS, where large amounts of data can be generated by the sensors of multiple vehicles.

##### Advanced Communication Protocols

Advanced communication protocols in ACS involve the use of more complex communication schemes, such as multimedia web ontology language (MOWL) or the Simple Function Point method. These protocols can facilitate the exchange of more detailed and structured information between vehicles, which can improve the accuracy and efficiency of the search process.

For example, the Simple Function Point method can be used to define and measure the complexity of the search task, which can be useful for task allocation and coordination. Similarly, MOWL can be used to define and process ontologies, which can be useful for representing and reasoning about the search task and its context.

##### Advanced Task Allocation Algorithms

Advanced task allocation algorithms in ACS involve the use of more sophisticated algorithms for assigning tasks to vehicles. These algorithms can take into account various factors, such as the capabilities of the vehicles, the complexity of the task, and the communication and coordination requirements.

For example, the Remez algorithm can be used to allocate tasks in a way that minimizes the overall search time. This algorithm involves the use of implicit data structures and multiset operations, which can be particularly useful in ACS.

In conclusion, advanced ACS involves the use of advanced search strategies, communication protocols, and task allocation algorithms. These advanced aspects can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the search process, making ACS a powerful tool for marine operations.




#### 9.1c Advanced Autonomous Collaborative Search

Advanced Autonomous Collaborative Search (ACS) builds upon the basic principles of ACS, incorporating advanced techniques and algorithms to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the search process. These advanced techniques include machine learning, artificial intelligence, and advanced communication protocols.

Machine learning algorithms can be used to improve the accuracy of target detection and tracking. These algorithms can learn from past experiences and adapt to changing environments, making them particularly suited for autonomous search and rescue operations. For example, a machine learning algorithm could be trained on a dataset of past search and rescue missions, learning to recognize patterns and features associated with targets. This could significantly improve the accuracy of target detection and tracking, reducing the time and resources required for the search.

Artificial intelligence can be used to automate the decision-making process in ACS. This could involve the use of decision trees, fuzzy logic, or other AI techniques to make decisions about the search strategy based on the information collected by the vehicles. For example, if a vehicle detects a target, it could use AI to decide whether to report the target immediately or continue searching for a certain period of time. This could help to optimize the search process, reducing the time and resources required to find a target.

Advanced communication protocols can be used to improve the efficiency of communication between vehicles. These protocols could include techniques such as multi-hop communication, where vehicles relay information to each other, or adaptive communication, where the communication strategy is adjusted based on the current conditions. These protocols could help to reduce the communication overhead and improve the reliability of communication, particularly in challenging environments.

The advanced ACS process can be represented mathematically as follows:

Let $N$ be the number of vehicles, $R$ be the search region, and $S_i$ be the subregion assigned to vehicle $i$. The search process can be represented as:

$$
\forall i \in \{1, ..., N\}: S_i \subseteq R
$$

The communication process can be represented as:

$$
\forall i, j \in \{1, ..., N\}: i \neq j \Rightarrow C_{ij} \subseteq S_i \cap S_j
$$

where $C_{ij}$ is the communication area between vehicles $i$ and $j$.

The update process can be represented as:

$$
\forall i \in \{1, ..., N\}: U_i = \bigcup_{j \in \{1, ..., N\}: j \neq i} C_{ij}
$$

where $U_i$ is the updated search area for vehicle $i$.

The decision-making process can be represented as:

$$
\forall i \in \{1, ..., N\}: D_i = f(I_i, U_i)
$$

where $D_i$ is the decision made by vehicle $i$, $I_i$ is the information collected by vehicle $i$, and $f$ is the decision-making function.

### Section: 10.1 Underwater Imaging:

Underwater imaging is a crucial aspect of marine autonomy, allowing us to capture images of the underwater environment and analyze it for various purposes. In this section, we will explore the principles of underwater imaging, specifically focusing on acoustics.

#### 10.1a Introduction to Underwater Imaging

Underwater imaging is the process of capturing images of the underwater environment. This can be done using various techniques, including optical imaging systems and imaging sonars. Optical imaging systems have been successfully used in deep ocean searches, either independently or in combination with a side-scan sonar. The obvious advantage of an optical imaging system is that the image produced can result in identification of the target without the need for time-consuming contact classification. However, these systems are limited by the attenuation of light and backscattering, which can degrade the image quality.

On the other hand, imaging sonars have gained resolution and accessibility, delivering better images. These sonars are used to produce complete maps of regions of the sea floor by stitching together sequences of sonar images. However, imaging sonar images often lack proper contrast and are degraded by artefacts and distortions due to noise, attitude changes of the AUV/ROV carrying the sonar, or non-uniform beam patterns.

One of the key challenges in underwater imaging is the assumption that corresponding pixels should have the same color. However, this cannot be guaranteed in an underwater scene due to dispersion and backscatter. To address this issue, it is possible to digitally model this phenomenon and create a virtual image with those effects removed.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the principles of acoustics and how it is used in underwater imaging. We will also explore the research interests of Dr. Balasuriya in this field and how it has contributed to the development of underwater imaging technology. 

#### 10.1b Underwater Imaging Techniques

There are several techniques used in underwater imaging, each with its own advantages and limitations. In this section, we will explore some of the most commonly used techniques, including optical imaging systems, imaging sonars, and acoustics.

##### Optical Imaging Systems

Optical imaging systems have been successfully used in deep ocean searches, either independently or in combination with a side-scan sonar. These systems rely on conventional strobe or floodlights as their illumination source. However, due to limitations imposed by attenuation of the light and backscattering, still and video sensors need to be within 10 to 20 meters of a target to identify it.

One of the main advantages of optical imaging systems is that the image produced can result in identification of the target without the need for time-consuming contact classification. However, these systems are limited by the attenuation of light and backscattering, which can degrade the image quality.

##### Imaging Sonars

Imaging sonars have gained resolution and accessibility, delivering better images. These sonars are used to produce complete maps of regions of the sea floor by stitching together sequences of sonar images. However, imaging sonar images often lack proper contrast and are degraded by artefacts and distortions due to noise, attitude changes of the AUV/ROV carrying the sonar, or non-uniform beam patterns.

One of the key challenges in imaging sonars is the assumption that corresponding pixels should have the same color. However, this cannot be guaranteed in an underwater scene due to dispersion and backscatter. To address this issue, it is possible to digitally model this phenomenon and create a virtual image with those effects removed.

##### Acoustics

Acoustics is a crucial aspect of underwater imaging, allowing us to capture images of the underwater environment. In this section, we will explore the principles of acoustics and how it is used in underwater imaging.

Acoustics is the branch of physics that deals with sound, which is a form of mechanical wave. In underwater imaging, acoustics is used to create images of the underwater environment. This is done by sending out sound waves and measuring the time it takes for the waves to bounce back, providing information about the objects in the water.

One of the key advantages of acoustics is that it is not affected by attenuation of light and backscattering, making it a reliable technique for imaging in deep ocean environments. However, acoustics also has its limitations, such as the inability to capture high-resolution images and the need for specialized equipment.

In the next section, we will explore the research interests of Dr. Balasuriya in underwater imaging, specifically focusing on acoustics. We will also discuss how his research has contributed to the development of underwater imaging technology.

#### 10.1c Applications in Marine Autonomy

##### Underwater Imaging for Autonomous Vehicles

Autonomous vehicles, such as underwater gliders and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), rely on underwater imaging for navigation, mapping, and target detection. These vehicles use optical imaging systems and imaging sonars to capture images of the underwater environment. The images are then processed and analyzed to determine the vehicle's position, identify underwater features, and detect targets of interest.

One of the key challenges in using underwater imaging for autonomous vehicles is the need for accurate and reliable image processing algorithms. These algorithms must be able to handle the challenges posed by the underwater environment, such as attenuation of light and backscatter, to accurately interpret the images and extract useful information.

##### Underwater Imaging for Underwater Exploration

Underwater imaging is also used for underwater exploration, allowing researchers to study and understand the underwater environment without the need for physical intervention. This is particularly useful in deep ocean environments, where traditional methods of exploration, such as manned submersibles, are not feasible.

Underwater imaging techniques, such as optical imaging systems and imaging sonars, are used to capture images of the underwater environment. These images are then processed and analyzed to identify underwater features, such as seafloor topography and marine life, and to study their behavior and interactions.

##### Underwater Imaging for Underwater Sensing

Underwater imaging is also used for underwater sensing, providing a means for autonomous vehicles to sense and detect changes in the underwater environment. This is particularly useful for tasks such as underwater mapping and monitoring, where the vehicle needs to continuously sense and update its understanding of the environment.

Underwater imaging techniques, such as acoustics and optical imaging systems, are used to sense changes in the underwater environment. These changes can then be used to update the vehicle's map of the environment, allowing it to navigate and perform tasks more effectively.

### Section: 10.1b Basic Underwater Imaging

Underwater imaging is a complex process that involves capturing images of the underwater environment. This can be done using various techniques, including optical imaging systems and imaging sonars. In this section, we will delve deeper into the basic principles of underwater imaging, focusing on the role of acoustics and the challenges faced in this field.

#### 10.1b.1 Acoustics in Underwater Imaging

Acoustics plays a crucial role in underwater imaging, particularly in imaging sonars. Sonar, short for sound navigation and ranging, is a technique that uses sound waves to navigate, communicate, and detect objects underwater. Imaging sonar, on the other hand, uses sound waves to create images of the underwater environment.

The basic principle of imaging sonar is similar to that of optical imaging systems. Both techniques aim to capture an image of the underwater environment. However, while optical imaging systems rely on light, imaging sonar uses sound waves. This is particularly useful in underwater environments where light is limited due to depth and turbidity.

#### 10.1b.2 Challenges in Underwater Imaging

Despite the advantages of imaging sonar, there are several challenges that need to be addressed. One of the main challenges is the assumption that corresponding pixels should have the same color. However, this cannot be guaranteed in an underwater scene due to dispersion and backscatter. Dispersion refers to the spreading of light or sound waves due to variations in the refractive index of the medium. Backscatter, on the other hand, refers to the reflection of sound waves back in the direction they came from.

To address these challenges, it is possible to digitally model the effects of dispersion and backscatter and create a virtual image with those effects removed. This involves using advanced image processing techniques to remove the effects of dispersion and backscatter from the captured image.

#### 10.1b.3 Future Directions

The field of underwater imaging is constantly evolving, with researchers continually working to improve the quality of images captured and the efficiency of the imaging process. One promising direction is the use of machine learning techniques to improve image quality. Machine learning algorithms can be trained to recognize and remove the effects of dispersion and backscatter from captured images, improving the overall quality of the image.

Another direction is the development of new imaging techniques that can overcome the limitations of current imaging systems. For example, researchers are exploring the use of mid-infrared (MIR) imaging for underwater applications. MIR imaging has several advantages over traditional imaging techniques, including the ability to penetrate deeper into the water column and the ability to image through sediment and other particles.

In conclusion, underwater imaging is a complex field that involves capturing images of the underwater environment. Acoustics plays a crucial role in this field, particularly in imaging sonar. However, there are several challenges that need to be addressed, including the effects of dispersion and backscatter. With ongoing research and development, it is likely that these challenges will be overcome, leading to improved image quality and more efficient imaging techniques.

This is because different frequencies penetrate the water at different depths, allowing for a more comprehensive view of the underwater environment.

Another advanced imaging sonar technique is the use of synthetic aperture sonar. This technique involves moving the sonar transducer along the water column and combining the received signals to create a high-resolution image. This technique is particularly useful in imaging large objects, such as ships or submarines.

#### 10.1c.2 Advanced Optical Imaging

Advanced optical imaging techniques aim to overcome the limitations of basic optical imaging systems. One such technique is the use of laser-imaging systems. These systems use a blue/green laser as the illumination source, which minimizes attenuation and backscattering problems. This allows for the imaging of targets as far as 50 meters away.

Another advanced optical imaging technique is the use of hyperspectral imaging. This technique involves capturing images at different wavelengths, allowing for a more detailed analysis of the underwater environment. This can be particularly useful in identifying different types of marine life or detecting changes in the water quality.

#### 10.1c.3 Challenges in Advanced Underwater Imaging

It enables the exchange of information between autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and surface vessels, and is particularly useful in deep-sea operations where other communication methods may not be feasible. In this section, we will provide a comprehensive guide to understanding the principles, techniques, and applications of acoustic communications in marine environments.

#### Basics of Acoustics

Acoustics is the study of sound, which is a form of mechanical energy that travels through a medium, such as air or water. In the context of marine autonomy, we are primarily concerned with sound waves traveling through water. The properties of sound waves in water are different from those in air, and understanding these differences is crucial for effective acoustic communications.

Sound waves in water are characterized by their frequency, wavelength, and amplitude. The frequency of a sound wave is the number of complete oscillations it makes in one second, and is measured in Hertz (Hz). The wavelength of a sound wave is the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs of the wave, and is measured in meters. The amplitude of a sound wave is the maximum displacement of the wave from its equilibrium position, and is measured in decibels (dB).

#### Acoustic Modulation Techniques

Acoustic modulation is the process of varying one or more properties of a sound wave to transmit information. There are several types of acoustic modulation techniques used in underwater acoustics, including amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), and phase modulation (PM).

AM is the simplest form of modulation, where the amplitude of the carrier signal is varied to transmit information. FM and PM, on the other hand, involve varying the frequency and phase of the carrier signal, respectively. These techniques are used to transmit different types of information, such as voice, data, and navigation signals.

#### Acoustic Signal Processing

Acoustic signal processing is the process of extracting information from acoustic signals. This involves filtering, modulation, and demodulation techniques to recover the transmitted information. Filtering is used to remove unwanted noise from the signal, while modulation and demodulation are used to extract the information from the modulated signal.

#### Applications of Acoustic Communications

Acoustic communications have a wide range of applications in marine autonomy. They are used for communication between AUVs and surface vessels, as well as for communication between multiple AUVs. They are also used for navigation, localization, and mapping in underwater environments.

#### Challenges and Limitations

Despite its many advantages, acoustic communications in marine environments also have some challenges and limitations. One of the main challenges is signal attenuation, which is the loss of signal strength as it travels through water. This can be caused by factors such as water temperature, salinity, and pressure. Interference from other sources, such as marine traffic and natural noise, can also pose a challenge for acoustic communications.

#### Future of Acoustic Communications

The future of acoustic communications in marine autonomy looks promising. With advancements in technology, it is possible to improve the reliability and range of acoustic communications.

### Section: 14.1 Introduction to Behavior Authoring:

Behavior authoring is a crucial aspect of marine autonomy, as it allows for the creation of complex and dynamic behaviors for autonomous systems. In this section, we will provide an overview of behavior authoring, discussing its importance and the various techniques used in this process.

#### 14.1a Introduction to Behavior Authoring

Behavior authoring is the process of creating and defining the behaviors of an autonomous system. It involves the use of programming languages and algorithms to define how the system should respond to different stimuli and tasks. This is a critical aspect of marine autonomy, as it allows the system to make decisions and perform tasks without human intervention.

The importance of behavior authoring in marine autonomy cannot be overstated. Autonomous systems are often deployed in remote or hazardous environments, where human intervention may not be possible or feasible. Therefore, the ability to program and author behaviors is crucial for the successful operation of these systems.

There are several techniques used in behavior authoring, each with its own strengths and limitations. One such technique is the use of behavior trees, which are used to formally represent the "fragment of behavior" in each individual requirement. These trees allow for the creation of complex behaviors by combining smaller, more basic behaviors.

Another technique is the use of artificial intelligence (AI) conversation agents, which are used to create more lifelike simulations. These agents use the Behavior Markup Language (BML) to synchronize speech recordings with non-verbal behaviors, allowing for more natural and realistic interactions.

However, there are also challenges and considerations involved in behavior authoring. One such challenge is the authoring problem, which refers to the difficulty of creating and defining behaviors in a way that accurately represents the artist's vision. This is where the BML Sequencer comes in, a tool that allows artists to create SmartBody compliant BML animation sequences for multiple virtual humans.

Another challenge is multi-party behavior synchronization, which refers to the difficulty of synchronizing the behaviors of multiple actors in a way that is realistic and natural. This is where the BML Sequencer also plays a role, as it allows for the synchronization of behaviors between multiple actors.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the various techniques and tools used in behavior authoring, providing a comprehensive guide to this crucial aspect of marine autonomy.





#### 14.1b Basic Behavior Authoring

In this subsection, we will discuss the basics of behavior authoring, including the use of behavior trees and the Behavior Markup Language (BML). We will also touch upon the challenges and considerations involved in behavior authoring, such as the authoring problem and the importance of traceability.

Behavior trees are a popular technique used in behavior authoring. They allow for the creation of complex behaviors by combining smaller, more basic behaviors. Each node in a behavior tree represents a behavior, and the tree is structured in a hierarchical manner, with more complex behaviors at the top and simpler behaviors at the bottom. This allows for the creation of dynamic and adaptive behaviors, as the system can branch out and try different behaviors based on the current state and environment.

The Behavior Markup Language (BML) is another important tool in behavior authoring. It is used to synchronize speech recordings with non-verbal behaviors, allowing for more natural and realistic interactions. BML is a markup language that defines the timing and synchronization of behaviors, as well as the parameters and variables used in those behaviors. This allows for more precise control over the behaviors of the system.

However, there are also challenges and considerations involved in behavior authoring. One such challenge is the authoring problem, which refers to the difficulty of creating and defining behaviors in a way that accurately represents the artist's vision. This is where traceability becomes crucial. Traceability refers to the ability to track the relationship between the formal representation of a behavior and its corresponding natural language requirement. This is important for ensuring that the behaviors created accurately reflect the intended functionality of the system.

In conclusion, behavior authoring is a crucial aspect of marine autonomy, allowing for the creation of complex and dynamic behaviors for autonomous systems. By using techniques such as behavior trees and BML, and considering the importance of traceability, we can create more accurate and efficient behaviors for marine autonomous systems. 





#### 14.1c Advanced Behavior Authoring

In this subsection, we will delve deeper into the advanced techniques and considerations involved in behavior authoring. We will explore the use of advanced behavior authoring tools and techniques, such as the Behavior Authoring Language (BAL) and the use of artificial intuition in behavior authoring.

The Behavior Authoring Language (BAL) is a powerful tool used for advanced behavior authoring. It allows for the creation of complex behaviors by defining the parameters and variables used in those behaviors. BAL is a programming language that is specifically designed for behavior authoring, and it allows for the creation of dynamic and adaptive behaviors.

One of the key features of BAL is its ability to handle the authoring problem. The authoring problem refers to the difficulty of creating and defining behaviors in a way that accurately represents the artist's vision. BAL addresses this problem by providing a user-friendly interface for defining behaviors, as well as built-in tools for debugging and testing behaviors.

Another important aspect of advanced behavior authoring is the use of artificial intuition. Artificial intuition refers to the ability of a system to make decisions and perform actions without explicit instructions or rules. This is achieved through the use of machine learning algorithms and neural networks, which allow the system to learn from experience and make decisions based on that learning.

The use of artificial intuition in behavior authoring has several benefits. It allows for the creation of more complex and dynamic behaviors, as the system can learn and adapt to new situations. It also reduces the need for explicit rules and instructions, making the authoring process more efficient and less prone to errors.

However, there are also challenges and considerations involved in the use of artificial intuition in behavior authoring. One such challenge is the need for large amounts of data for training the machine learning algorithms. This can be a limitation in certain applications, especially in the marine environment where data collection can be challenging.

In conclusion, advanced behavior authoring involves the use of advanced tools and techniques, such as BAL and artificial intuition, to create complex and dynamic behaviors. While there are challenges and considerations involved, the benefits of these techniques make them essential for the development of autonomous marine systems.

### Section: 17.1 Parameter Estimation:

Parameter estimation is a fundamental concept in the field of marine autonomy, sensing, and communications. It involves the process of determining the values of unknown parameters based on observed data. In this section, we will provide an introduction to parameter estimation, discussing its importance and the different types of estimation methods used in the field.

#### 17.1a Introduction to Parameter Estimation

Parameter estimation is a crucial aspect of marine autonomy, sensing, and communications. It allows us to determine the values of unknown parameters, such as the speed of a vessel or the depth of the water, which are essential for the proper functioning of autonomous systems. Accurate estimation of these parameters is crucial for the successful operation of these systems, as it allows them to make informed decisions and navigate their environment effectively.

There are several types of parameter estimation methods used in the field, including maximum likelihood estimation, least squares estimation, and Bayesian estimation. Each of these methods has its own strengths and limitations, and the choice of method depends on the specific application and the available data.

Maximum likelihood estimation is a method that estimates the parameters of a model by maximizing the likelihood function. The likelihood function is a measure of the probability of the observed data given the parameters of the model. By maximizing this function, we can determine the values of the parameters that are most likely to have produced the observed data.

Least squares estimation, on the other hand, is a method that estimates the parameters of a model by minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed data and the model predictions. This method is commonly used in linear regression and is particularly useful when dealing with large amounts of data.

Bayesian estimation is a method that uses Bayesian statistics to estimate the parameters of a model. This method is based on Bayes' theorem, which states that the probability of a hypothesis is proportional to the prior probability of the hypothesis multiplied by the likelihood of the observed data given the hypothesis. By using Bayesian estimation, we can incorporate prior knowledge about the parameters into our estimation process.

In the context of marine autonomy, sensing, and communications, parameter estimation plays a crucial role in various applications. For example, in underwater acoustics, parameter estimation is used to estimate the parameters of a signal, such as its amplitude and frequency, which are essential for communication and navigation. In underwater imaging, parameter estimation is used to estimate the parameters of an image, such as its resolution and noise level, which are crucial for image processing and analysis.

However, there are also challenges and limitations to parameter estimation in these fields. For instance, in underwater acoustics, the presence of noise and interference can significantly affect the accuracy of parameter estimation. In underwater imaging, the limited bandwidth and resolution of imaging systems can also pose challenges for parameter estimation.

In conclusion, parameter estimation is a fundamental concept in the field of marine autonomy, sensing, and communications. It allows us to determine the values of unknown parameters, which are essential for the proper functioning of autonomous systems. By understanding the different types of estimation methods and their applications, we can effectively use parameter estimation to solve real-world problems in these fields.

In the context of parameter estimation, Bayesian estimation allows us to incorporate prior knowledge about the parameters into the estimation process.

### Subsection: 17.1b Basic Parameter Estimation

Basic parameter estimation involves estimating the parameters of a model using a single set of data. This can be done using any of the three methods mentioned above, depending on the specific application and the available data.

Maximum likelihood estimation is often used for basic parameter estimation, as it provides a way to determine the most likely values for the parameters based on the observed data. This method is particularly useful when dealing with small amounts of data, as it can provide more accurate estimates compared to other methods.

Least squares estimation is also commonly used for basic parameter estimation, especially when dealing with large amounts of data. It is particularly useful for linear models, as it can provide efficient and accurate estimates of the parameters.

Bayesian estimation is also a popular choice for basic parameter estimation, as it allows us to incorporate prior knowledge about the parameters into the estimation process. This can be particularly useful when dealing with complex models or when there is a lack of data.

In conclusion, basic parameter estimation is a crucial aspect of marine autonomy, sensing, and communications. It allows us to determine the values of unknown parameters, which are essential for the proper functioning of autonomous systems. By using different estimation methods, we can obtain accurate estimates of these parameters, which are crucial for the successful operation of these systems.

We have also examined different methods for parameter estimation, including the least squares method, the maximum likelihood method, and the Kalman filter.

One of the key takeaways from this chapter is the importance of understanding the underlying model and assumptions when performing parameter estimation. The accuracy of the estimated parameters heavily depends on the validity of these assumptions. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider the model and assumptions before applying any parameter estimation method.

Another important aspect to note is the trade-off between bias and variance in parameter estimation. While the least squares method is known for its low bias, it can also have high variance, leading to less accurate estimates. On the other hand, the maximum likelihood method has lower variance but can introduce bias. The Kalman filter, on the other hand, provides a balance between bias and variance, making it a popular choice for parameter estimation in many applications.

In conclusion, parameter estimation plays a crucial role in marine autonomy, sensing, and communications. It allows us to accurately estimate unknown parameters, which are essential for various applications. However, it is crucial to carefully consider the model and assumptions before applying any parameter estimation method to ensure accurate and reliable results.
