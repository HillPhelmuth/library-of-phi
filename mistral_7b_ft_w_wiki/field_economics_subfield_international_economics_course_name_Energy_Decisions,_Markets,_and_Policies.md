Energy systems are composed of several key components. These include energy sources, conversion technologies, distribution systems, and end-use devices.

Energy sources are the raw materials from which energy is produced. These can be renewable (such as solar, wind, and hydro power) or non-renewable (such as fossil fuels and nuclear energy). The choice of energy source has significant implications for the environment, the economy, and society.

Conversion technologies are used to transform energy from one form to another. For instance, a power plant might use a fossil fuel as its energy source, and then convert it into electricity. The efficiency of these conversion technologies can have a major impact on the overall efficiency of the energy system.

Distribution systems are used to deliver energy from the point of production to the end-user. These can be physical (such as pipelines or power lines) or virtual (such as the internet). The design and operation of these systems can greatly influence the reliability and security of the energy supply.

End-use devices are the devices that consume energy. These can be household appliances, industrial machinery, or transportation equipment. The efficiency of these devices can have a significant impact on the overall energy consumption of the system.

#### 1.1c Energy System Planning and Management

Energy system planning and management involves the strategic planning and operation of energy systems to meet the energy needs of society. This includes decisions about the types of energy sources to use, the technologies to employ, and the policies to implement.

Energy system planning and management is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of the energy system, the energy market, and the energy policies in place. It also requires the ability to make decisions under uncertainty, to balance competing interests, and to adapt to changes in the energy landscape.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these topics, exploring the principles, methods, and tools used in energy system planning and management. We will also discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with these tasks, and how they can be addressed.

#### Market Mechanisms in Energy Decisions

Market mechanisms, such as supply and demand, play a crucial role in energy decisions. The law of supply and demand determines the price of energy sources, with the price being determined by the intersection of the supply and demand curves. This mechanism allows for the efficient allocation of resources, as producers are incentivized to produce more of a particular energy source when the price is high, and consumers are incentivized to consume more when the price is low.

In addition to supply and demand, market mechanisms also play a role in determining the incentives for investment in new energy technologies. For example, in a competitive market, companies are incentivized to invest in new technologies that can produce energy more efficiently or at a lower cost. This promotes innovation and can lead to the development of new and sustainable energy sources.

#### Market Failures in Energy Decisions

Despite the benefits of market mechanisms, there are also instances of market failures in the energy sector. Market failures occur when the market is unable to allocate resources efficiently, leading to suboptimal outcomes. One example of a market failure in the energy sector is the externalities associated with energy production and consumption.

Externalities, such as pollution and environmental impacts, are not accounted for in the market price of energy. This leads to an underestimation of the true cost of energy, as these externalities are not reflected in the market price. This can result in overconsumption and overproduction of energy, leading to negative impacts on the environment and society.

#### Government Intervention in Energy Markets

Government intervention in energy markets is necessary to address market failures and promote the public interest. This can take the form of regulations, subsidies, or incentives for investment in new energy technologies. For example, governments may implement carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems to internalize the externalities associated with energy production and consumption.

In addition, governments may also provide subsidies or incentives for investment in renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydro power. This can help reduce the reliance on fossil fuels and promote the development of sustainable energy sources.

#### State Mechanisms in Energy Decisions

State mechanisms, such as regulations and policies, play a crucial role in energy decisions. Regulations, such as emissions standards and safety regulations, are set by the state to ensure the protection of the environment and public safety. These regulations can also impact the market price of energy, as they may limit the production or consumption of certain energy sources.

Policies, such as subsidies and incentives, are also set by the state to promote the use of certain energy sources or technologies. These policies can influence the market price of energy and incentivize investment in new energy technologies. For example, a policy that provides tax credits for the use of renewable energy sources can encourage companies to invest in these technologies, leading to a more sustainable energy future.

#### State Failures in Energy Decisions

Despite the benefits of state mechanisms, there are also instances of state failures in the energy sector. State failures occur when the state is unable to effectively regulate or policy the energy sector, leading to negative outcomes. One example of a state failure is the lack of coordination between different levels of government in energy policies.

In the United States, for example, energy policies are often set at the federal level, but implementation and enforcement are left to the states. This can lead to inconsistencies and conflicts between different state policies, making it difficult for the energy sector to operate efficiently. Additionally, state failures can also occur when there is a lack of political will or resources to effectively regulate or policy the energy sector.

### Conclusion

The role of the state in energy decisions is crucial, as it sets the framework for market mechanisms and policies. While state failures can occur, effective state mechanisms can lead to more efficient and sustainable energy decisions.

Climate agreement negotiations have been fraught with challenges since their inception. These challenges have been largely due to the complex nature of the issue, the diverse interests of the stakeholders involved, and the lack of a clear consensus on the best course of action.

#### 2.2c.1 Complexity of the Issue

The climate problem is a complex one, with multiple interconnected factors contributing to it. This complexity makes it difficult to reach a consensus on the best course of action. For instance, the issue of deforestation, as highlighted in the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, is a complex one. While it is clear that deforestation contributes to climate change, the solutions proposed to address it are not straightforward. The agreement to end deforestation by 2030, for instance, is a laudable goal, but it is also one that is fraught with challenges. For instance, the agreement does not specify how the signatories will achieve this goal, nor does it provide any mechanism for enforcement. This complexity makes it difficult to reach a consensus on the best course of action.

#### 2.2c.2 Diverse Interests of Stakeholders

The climate problem affects a wide range of stakeholders, each with their own interests and perspectives. This diversity of interests makes it difficult to reach a consensus on the best course of action. For instance, the agreement to end deforestation by 2030 was met with resistance from some countries, such as Indonesia, which argued that forcing them to achieve zero deforestation by 2030 was "clearly inappropriate and unfair". This diversity of interests makes it difficult to reach a consensus on the best course of action.

#### 2.2c.3 Lack of Consensus on the Best Course of Action

Despite the best efforts of negotiators, there is still no clear consensus on the best course of action to address the climate problem. This lack of consensus makes it difficult to reach a consensus on the best course of action. For instance, the negotiations surrounding Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which describes rules for an international carbon market, have been ongoing for several years without a clear resolution. This lack of consensus makes it difficult to reach a consensus on the best course of action.

In conclusion, the challenges in climate agreement negotiations are numerous and complex. However, they are not insurmountable. With continued efforts and a willingness to compromise, it is possible to reach a consensus on the best course of action to address the climate problem.

#### 2.3a.1 The Kyoto Protocol and Canada

Canada, as a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, was required to reduce its emissions to 6% below 1990 levels by 2012. However, Canada did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol until 2010, and even then, it only agreed to a 2020 target of 17% below 1990 levels. This delay and reluctance to commit to more ambitious targets have been a source of controversy.

#### 2.3a.2 Economic Factors and Canada's Emissions

Canada's economy is heavily reliant on the energy sector, which creates challenges in meeting emissions standards. The energy industry generates about a quarter of Canada's export revenues and employs some 650,000 people across the country. This reliance on the energy sector has made it difficult for Canada to reduce its emissions.

#### 2.3a.3 Geographic Considerations and Canada's Emissions

Canada's geography, with its vast distances between many communities combined with the length and coldness of Canadian winters, contributes to Canada's high hydrocarbon consumption. As temperatures drop, fuel consumption rises and fuel efficiency drops. However, this has been largely taken into account by the structure of the Kyoto Protocol, which assigns targets depending on the given country's own emissions in 1990. Since in 1990 Canada was already vast and even colder than today, its emissions were already much higher, and, consequently, Canada's 2012 Kyoto target much more forgiving, than the targets of other countries with comparable population sizes.

#### 2.3a.4 The Role of the Kyoto Protocol in Addressing Climate Change

Despite its challenges, the Kyoto Protocol has played a crucial role in raising awareness about climate change and promoting action to address it. It has also provided a framework for countries to work together to reduce emissions. However, it has also faced criticism for not going far enough and for allowing countries like Canada to delay and dilute their commitments.

In conclusion, the Kyoto Protocol has been a significant step forward in the global effort to address climate change, but it has also faced numerous challenges. These challenges underscore the complexity of the issue and the need for a comprehensive and coordinated approach to climate change.




### Subsection: 2.3b Case Study: Paris Agreement

The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, is the latest international agreement on climate change. It aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with a goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius. The agreement also includes provisions for countries to regularly report on their emissions and progress towards their targets, as well as to increase their commitments over time.

#### 2.3b.1 The Paris Agreement and Canada

Canada, as a signatory to the Paris Agreement, has committed to reducing its emissions by 30% below 1990 levels by 2030. This is a significant increase from its previous commitment under the Kyoto Protocol. However, Canada has faced criticism for its lack of progress in meeting these targets.

#### 2.3b.2 Economic Factors and Canada's Emissions

As mentioned earlier, Canada's economy is heavily reliant on the energy sector. This has made it difficult for Canada to reduce its emissions, despite its commitment to the Paris Agreement. The energy industry generates about a quarter of Canada's export revenues and employs some 650,000 people across the country. This reliance on the energy sector has made it difficult for Canada to transition to a low-carbon economy.

#### 2.3b.3 Geographic Considerations and Canada's Emissions

Canada's geography, with its vast distances between many communities combined with the length and coldness of Canadian winters, contributes to Canada's high hydrocarbon consumption. As temperatures drop, fuel consumption rises and fuel efficiency drops. However, this has been largely taken into account by the structure of the Paris Agreement, which allows for differentiated targets based on each country's specific circumstances.

#### 2.3b.4 The Role of the Paris Agreement in Addressing Climate Change

The Paris Agreement represents a significant step forward in the global effort to address climate change. It sets more ambitious targets than the Kyoto Protocol and includes provisions for increased transparency and accountability. However, it also faces challenges, such as the need for more ambitious commitments from major emitters like Canada. The success of the Paris Agreement will depend on the collective efforts of all signatory countries to reduce their emissions and transition to a low-carbon future.

As we have seen in the previous section, Canada's economy is heavily reliant on the energy sector, which has made it difficult for the country to reduce its emissions. However, advancements in technology, such as carbon capture and storage, could potentially provide a solution to this problem.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a technology that aims to reduce emissions from industrial processes by capturing the carbon dioxide produced and storing it in geological formations. This technology could significantly reduce Canada's emissions from the energy sector, making it easier for the country to meet its targets under the Paris Agreement.

#### 2.3c.2 The Role of International Cooperation

Another crucial factor in the future of climate agreement negotiations is the role of international cooperation. The Paris Agreement relies heavily on countries' individual commitments, which can be difficult to enforce. However, with increased international cooperation and the sharing of best practices, countries can work together to achieve more significant reductions in emissions.

For example, the European Union has been a leader in implementing policies to reduce emissions, such as the Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). This system, which puts a cap on emissions and allows for trading of emission allowances, has been successful in reducing emissions in the EU. If other countries were to adopt similar policies, it could significantly impact global emissions and help us reach the targets set in the Paris Agreement.

#### 2.3c.3 The Role of Public Policy

Public policy will also play a crucial role in the future of climate agreement negotiations. As we have seen in the previous section, Canada's reliance on the energy sector has made it difficult for the country to reduce its emissions. However, with the right policies in place, this could change.

For instance, implementing a carbon tax, as British Columbia has done, can significantly reduce emissions from the energy sector. A carbon tax sets a price on carbon emissions, incentivizing industries to reduce their emissions and invest in cleaner technologies. This could be a powerful tool in helping countries meet their targets under the Paris Agreement.

In conclusion, the future of climate agreement negotiations is complex and uncertain. However, with advancements in technology, increased international cooperation, and the implementation of effective public policies, we can work towards a more sustainable future for our planet.

#### 3.2a Understanding Normative Frameworks

Normative frameworks are sets of principles, values, and norms that guide decision-making processes. They provide a framework for evaluating the appropriateness of decisions and actions. In the context of energy demand, normative frameworks can be used to evaluate the ethical and social implications of energy decisions, markets, and policies.

#### The Logic of Appropriateness

One of the most influential normative frameworks in the field of energy demand is the logic of appropriateness. This concept was first proposed by James G. March and Johan Olsen, who argued that decision-making in organizations is guided by a logic of appropriateness. This logic is based on the assumption that individuals and organizations act in accordance with their perceived norms and values.

The logic of appropriateness has been criticized by some scholars. For instance, Ole Jacob Sending argues that this concept has a structural bias both regarding the understanding and the explanation of individual action. He concludes that it is untenable as a theory of "individual" action.

Kjell Goldmann also criticizes the logic of appropriateness, arguing that it is difficult to determine what kind of constructs the so-called logics are. He also charges that the logics of appropriateness and consequences overlap considerably, which, in his eyes, makes their "analytic utility [...] debatable." Moreover, he finds that March and Olsen "do not adequately distinguish between the actions of individuals and collectivities." This is important, however, "because one logic may predominate at the level of individuals within an organization and another logic at the level of the organization itself."

#### The Role of Emotion in Normative Action

Another critique of the logic of appropriateness is that it neglects the emotional underpinnings of normative motivation. March and Olsen acknowledge that human decision-making may be driven by emotion. Yet, their conceptualization of the logic of appropriateness disregards the role of emotion and focuses solely on its "cognitive and normative components." They treat rule-following as a "cognitive process involving thoughtful, reasoning behavior."

Drawing on research in neuroscience and psychology, Robin Markwica points out that emotion plays a key role in normative action. Emotions endow norms and identities with meaning. If people feel strongly about norms, they are particularly likely to adhere to them. Rules that cease to resonate at an affective level, however, often come to lose their prescriptive power.

In the next section, we will explore how these normative frameworks can be applied to evaluate the ethical and social implications of energy decisions, markets, and policies.

#### 3.2b Evaluating Normative Frameworks

Evaluating normative frameworks is a crucial step in understanding the ethical and social implications of energy decisions, markets, and policies. This evaluation involves assessing the appropriateness of these frameworks in guiding decision-making processes. 

#### The Logic of Appropriateness and Energy Decision-Making

The logic of appropriateness, as proposed by March and Olsen, can be a useful normative framework for evaluating energy decisions. This logic assumes that individuals and organizations act in accordance with their perceived norms and values. In the context of energy decisions, this could mean that decisions are made based on what is perceived to be socially acceptable, environmentally friendly, or economically viable.

However, the logic of appropriateness has been criticized for its structural bias and difficulty in determining its analytic utility. Sending argues that this logic is untenable as a theory of individual action, while Goldmann finds that it overlaps considerably with the logic of consequences. These criticisms suggest that the logic of appropriateness may not be the most comprehensive normative framework for evaluating energy decisions.

#### The Role of Emotion in Energy Decision-Making

The neglect of emotion in the logic of appropriateness is another area of criticism. Markwica argues that emotion plays a key role in normative action, and this is particularly true in the context of energy decisions. Emotions such as concern for the environment, fear of climate change, and anger at energy companies can influence how individuals and organizations perceive and respond to energy decisions.

For instance, the emotional response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 led to a shift in public opinion and policy towards offshore drilling. This emotional response was a key factor in the subsequent moratorium on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. This example illustrates the importance of considering emotion in evaluating normative frameworks for energy decisions.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, evaluating normative frameworks is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of the ethical and social implications of energy decisions. The logic of appropriateness and the role of emotion are two key areas to consider in this evaluation. While the logic of appropriateness has been criticized, it remains a useful framework for understanding energy decisions. The role of emotion, however, cannot be overlooked and should be given due consideration in any normative framework for energy decisions.

#### 3.2c Case Studies of Normative Frameworks

In this section, we will explore some case studies that illustrate the application of normative frameworks in energy decision-making. These case studies will provide a practical perspective on the theoretical concepts discussed in the previous sections.

#### Case Study 1: The Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill

The Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 is a prime example of how normative frameworks can influence energy decisions. The spill, caused by the failure of a blowout preventer, resulted in the release of over 4 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. The environmental and economic impacts of the spill were significant, leading to a public outcry and calls for stricter regulations in the energy sector.

The logic of appropriateness was evident in the public response to the spill. The perceived inappropriateness of the spill, given societal norms and values, led to a shift in public opinion and policy towards offshore drilling. This shift was driven by emotions such as concern for the environment and anger at the energy company responsible for the spill.

However, the logic of appropriateness was also criticized in this case. Some argued that the spill was not an isolated incident, but rather a result of systemic issues in the energy industry. This critique suggests that the logic of appropriateness may not be sufficient to address all aspects of energy decision-making.

#### Case Study 2: The Renewable Energy Transition

The transition towards renewable energy sources provides another example of how normative frameworks can influence energy decisions. This transition is driven by a variety of factors, including environmental concerns, economic considerations, and technological advancements.

The logic of appropriateness is evident in the shift towards renewable energy. The perceived appropriateness of renewable energy, given societal norms and values, has led to increased investment and policy support for this sector. However, the logic of appropriateness has also been criticized in this case.
