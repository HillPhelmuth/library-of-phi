Welcome to the Advanced Igneous Petrology Textbook, a comprehensive guide to understanding the complex and fascinating world of igneous rocks. This book is designed for advanced undergraduate students at MIT, and aims to provide a thorough understanding of the principles and processes that govern the formation and evolution of igneous rocks.

The study of igneous petrology is a vast and multifaceted field, encompassing a wide range of topics from the origin of the Earth's mantle to the role of plate tectonics in the evolution of the continents. This book will delve into these topics and more, providing a comprehensive overview of the field and equipping readers with the knowledge and skills necessary to further explore this exciting area of study.

In writing this book, we have been greatly influenced by the work of Warren B. Hamilton, a renowned geologist and scholar whose work has greatly contributed to our understanding of Precambrian tectonics. Hamilton's work has shown that the Earth's thermal structure and geodynamics have varied significantly over time, and that the processes of plate tectonics and "plume" processes have not been active throughout the Earth's history.

This book will explore these ideas in depth, providing a critical analysis of the mainstream literature on Earth's Precambrian geology. We will delve into the concept of plate tectonics and its role in the evolution of the continents, and will also examine the lack of evidence for plate tectonics in rocks older than late Proterozoic. We will also explore the unique characteristics of Archean volcanic and granitic rocks, and how they differ from their Phanerozoic counterparts.

Throughout this book, we will also emphasize the importance of field relationships and chemical compositions in understanding the formation and evolution of igneous rocks. We will also discuss the limitations of conventional interpretations of plate tectonics, and will encourage readers to think critically about these ideas.

We hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for students at MIT, and will inspire them to further explore the fascinating world of igneous petrology. We also hope that it will contribute to the ongoing dialogue about the Earth's history and the processes that have shaped it.

Thank you for joining us on this journey through the world of igneous petrology. We hope you find this book informative and engaging, and we look forward to hearing about your own explorations in this exciting field.

## Chapter 1: Rock-forming Minerals:

### Introduction

Welcome to the first chapter of "Advanced Igneous Petrology Textbook". In this chapter, we will be exploring the fundamental building blocks of igneous rocks - rock-forming minerals. These minerals are the result of the crystallization of molten rock, or magma, and play a crucial role in the formation and evolution of igneous rocks.

Igneous rocks are one of the three main types of rocks, along with sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. They are formed through the cooling and solidification of magma, and their properties and characteristics are largely determined by the composition and behavior of the minerals that make them up.

In this chapter, we will delve into the world of rock-forming minerals, exploring their physical and chemical properties, as well as their role in the formation of igneous rocks. We will also discuss the different types of rock-forming minerals, including silicate minerals, non-silicate minerals, and accessory minerals.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of the fundamental concepts of rock-forming minerals and their importance in the study of igneous petrology. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for the rest of the book, as we delve deeper into the complex world of igneous rocks and their formation.

So let's begin our journey into the fascinating world of rock-forming minerals and their role in the formation of igneous rocks. 


# Title: Advanced Igneous Petrology Textbook":

## Chapter 1: Rock-forming Minerals:




### Section 1.1: Olivine and Spinel:

Olivine and spinel are two of the most common rock-forming minerals found in igneous rocks. They are both silicate minerals, meaning they are composed of silicon and oxygen atoms. However, they have distinct chemical and physical properties that make them easily distinguishable from each other.

#### 1.1a Crystal structure and chemical composition of olivine and spinel

Olivine is a magnesium-iron silicate with the chemical formula (Mg,Fe)<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>. It has a simple crystal structure, with a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice. This means that the atoms in olivine are arranged in a regular pattern, with each atom surrounded by 12 nearest neighbors. This crystal structure is responsible for olivine's characteristic green color.

Spinel, on the other hand, has a more complex crystal structure. It is a cubic mineral with a spinel structure, meaning it has a face-centered cubic lattice with a slight distortion. This distortion is caused by the different sizes of the atoms in spinel, with the magnesium atoms being smaller than the oxygen and silicon atoms. This distortion results in a unique optical properties, with spinel exhibiting double refraction.

The chemical composition of olivine and spinel also differs. Olivine is primarily composed of magnesium and iron, with some silicon and oxygen. Spinel, on the other hand, is composed of magnesium, aluminum, and oxygen. This difference in composition is reflected in their physical properties, with olivine being more malleable and spinel being more brittle.

### Subsection 1.1b: Physical properties of olivine and spinel

The physical properties of olivine and spinel are also distinct. Olivine is a soft mineral, with a Mohs hardness of 6.5. This means it can be easily scratched by a fingernail. Spinel, on the other hand, is much harder, with a Mohs hardness of 8. This makes it more resistant to scratching and breaking.

Olivine is also more dense than spinel, with a specific gravity of 3.2. This means it is heavier than spinel, which has a specific gravity of 3.6. This difference in density can be attributed to the different crystal structures of the two minerals.

In terms of optical properties, olivine is isotropic, meaning its refractive index is the same in all directions. This results in a single, green color when viewed under a polarizing microscope. Spinel, on the other hand, is anisotropic, meaning its refractive index is different in different directions. This results in a double refraction, with a green and a blue color when viewed under a polarizing microscope.

### Subsection 1.1c: Role of olivine and spinel in igneous processes

Olivine and spinel play important roles in igneous processes. Olivine is commonly found in basaltic magmas, which are the most common type of igneous magma. Its low melting point and high viscosity make it a key component in the formation of basaltic rocks. Olivine also plays a role in the formation of ultramafic rocks, such as peridotite, which are composed of more than 90% olivine.

Spinel, on the other hand, is commonly found in more evolved magmas, such as andesite and dacite. Its high melting point and low viscosity make it a key component in the formation of these more silica-rich rocks. Spinel also plays a role in the formation of garnet peridotite, a type of ultramafic rock that is composed of more than 90% spinel and garnet.

In addition to their roles in the formation of igneous rocks, olivine and spinel also play a role in the formation of meteorites. Olivine is a common component of chondrites, the most primitive type of meteorite. Spinel, on the other hand, is found in achondrites, a type of meteorite that is thought to have originated from the differentiation of a molten magma ocean.

Overall, olivine and spinel are two important rock-forming minerals that play a crucial role in igneous processes. Their distinct chemical and physical properties make them easily distinguishable from each other, and their roles in the formation of igneous rocks and meteorites make them essential components in the study of advanced igneous petrology.

### Section 1.1b: Petrologic significance of olivine and spinel in igneous rocks

Olivine and spinel play a crucial role in the petrology of igneous rocks. Their presence and abundance can provide valuable insights into the origin and evolution of these rocks.

#### 1.1b.1 Olivine in Igneous Rocks

Olivine is a common mineral in igneous rocks, particularly in ultramafic rocks such as peridotite. Its presence is often indicative of a high magnesium content in the rock. This is because olivine is one of the most magnesium-rich minerals, with a magnesium number (Mg#) of 89. The Mg# is a measure of the relative abundance of magnesium and iron in a rock, and it is calculated as the mol% of magnesium in the total content of iron plus magnesium.

The presence of olivine in a rock can also provide information about the rock's melting history. Olivine is a common mineral in the lower mantle, and it is often found in peridotite, a rock that is thought to originate from the lower mantle. The presence of olivine in a rock can therefore suggest a mantle origin.

#### 1.1b.2 Spinel in Igneous Rocks

Spinel is another important mineral in igneous rocks. It is particularly abundant in ultramafic rocks, where it can make up up to 20% of the rock. Its presence can provide valuable information about the rock's melting history and its origin.

The presence of spinel in a rock can indicate a high iron content. This is because spinel is a common mineral in iron-rich magmas. The presence of spinel can also suggest a high pressure and temperature of formation, as spinel is stable at high pressures and temperatures.

#### 1.1b.3 Olivine and Spinel in Peridotite

Peridotite is a rock that is composed primarily of olivine and pyroxene. The presence of olivine and spinel in peridotite can provide valuable information about the rock's origin and evolution.

The presence of olivine and spinel in peridotite can suggest a mantle origin. This is because these minerals are common in the lower mantle, and peridotite is thought to originate from the lower mantle.

The relative abundance of olivine and spinel in peridotite can also provide information about the rock's melting history. For example, the presence of more olivine than spinel can suggest a relatively low melting temperature, while the presence of more spinel than olivine can suggest a higher melting temperature.

In conclusion, olivine and spinel are important minerals in the petrology of igneous rocks. Their presence and abundance can provide valuable insights into the origin and evolution of these rocks.

### Section 1.2a Classification and crystal chemistry of pyroxenes

Pyroxenes are a group of silicate minerals that are characterized by their chain-like structure. They are an important component of many igneous rocks, and their presence can provide valuable insights into the origin and evolution of these rocks.

#### 1.2a.1 Classification of Pyroxenes

Pyroxenes are classified based on their chemical composition and crystal structure. The most common types of pyroxenes are the calcium-iron-magnesium pyroxenes, which include enstatite, ferrosilite, hypersthene, and pigeonite. These minerals are defined by the chemical species occupying the X (or M2) site, the Y (or M1) site, and the tetrahedral T site.

The names of these minerals are primarily defined by the chemical species occupying these sites. For example, enstatite is named for its predominance of magnesium ions in the X site, while ferrosilite is named for its predominance of iron ions in the Y site. Hypersthene and pigeonite are named for their intermediate compositions between enstatite and ferrosilite.

#### 1.2a.2 Crystal Chemistry of Pyroxenes

The crystal chemistry of pyroxenes is largely determined by the size and charge of the cations occupying the X, Y, and T sites. The X and Y sites are typically occupied by cations with a charge of +2, while the T site is typically occupied by silicon ions.

The size of the cations can also play a role in the crystal structure of pyroxenes. For example, the enstatite-ferrosilite series includes the common rock-forming mineral Hypersthene, which contains up to 5 mol.% calcium. The presence of calcium ions in the X site can prevent the formation of the orthorhombic phases and pigeonite only crystallises in the monoclinic system.

#### 1.2a.3 Miscibility Gap in Pyroxenes

The calcium content of pyroxenes can also lead to a miscibility gap between pigeonite and augite compositions. This miscibility gap is due to the inability of pyroxenes with calcium contents between about 15 and 25 mol.% to coexist in a stable state with respect to a pair of exolved crystals. This leads to the formation of distinct pigeonite and augite phases.

The divide between augite and the diopside-hedenbergite solid solution is taken at >45 mol.% Ca. This arbitrary separation is necessary to distinguish between these two minerals, which have similar chemical compositions but different crystal structures.

In conclusion, the classification and crystal chemistry of pyroxenes are largely determined by the chemical species occupying the X, Y, and T sites. The size and charge of these cations can influence the crystal structure and stability of these minerals, and can provide valuable insights into the origin and evolution of igneous rocks.




### Section 1.2b Occurrence and petrogenetic significance of pyroxenes in igneous rocks

Pyroxenes are a common component of many igneous rocks, and their occurrence can provide valuable insights into the origin and evolution of these rocks. The presence of pyroxenes in a rock can indicate the conditions under which the rock was formed, including the temperature, pressure, and chemical composition of the melt.

#### 1.2b.1 Occurrence of Pyroxenes

Pyroxenes are found in a variety of igneous rocks, including basalt, andesite, dacite, and rhyolite. They are particularly common in the Potrillo volcanic field, where they are found in the Kilbourne Hole crater. The Kilbourne Hole crater is notable for the abundance of xenoliths, which are fragments of country rock carried intact to the surface by the eruption. These xenoliths include both upper mantle rocks and lower crustal rocks, and they provide valuable insights into the composition and structure of the Earth's interior.

#### 1.2b.2 Petrogenetic Significance of Pyroxenes

The petrogenetic significance of pyroxenes is largely determined by their crystal chemistry. The size and charge of the cations occupying the X, Y, and T sites can provide information about the conditions under which the pyroxene was formed. For example, the presence of calcium ions in the X site can indicate the presence of a miscibility gap between pigeonite and augite compositions, which can provide insights into the temperature and pressure conditions of the melt.

Furthermore, the presence of pyroxenes in a rock can also provide information about the source of the melt. For example, the presence of magnesium-poor adakites at Monte Burney can indicate the subduction of a relatively hot and young Antarctic Plate. This can provide insights into the tectonic history of the region.

In conclusion, the occurrence and petrogenetic significance of pyroxenes in igneous rocks are crucial for understanding the origin and evolution of these rocks. By studying the crystal chemistry of pyroxenes, we can gain valuable insights into the conditions under which these rocks were formed and the tectonic history of the regions in which they are found.

### Conclusion

### Section 1.3a Structure and properties of pyriboles

Pyriboles are a group of minerals that are characterized by their unique crystal structure and properties. They are typically found in igneous rocks and can provide valuable insights into the conditions under which these rocks were formed.

#### 1.3a.1 Structure of Pyriboles

Pyriboles are members of the pyribole group, which is part of the larger silicate group. They are characterized by their tetrahedral crystal structure, which is similar to that of other silicate minerals. However, the arrangement of the atoms within the tetrahedron is what distinguishes pyriboles from other silicates.

The crystal structure of pyriboles is typically described as a "double chain" structure, where the silicon atoms are surrounded by four oxygen atoms, forming a tetrahedron. These tetrahedra are then linked together to form a chain, with the silicon atoms pointing in opposite directions. This structure is unique to pyriboles and is what gives them their characteristic properties.

#### 1.3a.2 Properties of Pyriboles

The properties of pyriboles are largely determined by their crystal structure. They are typically hard and brittle, with a high melting point. This makes them resistant to weathering and erosion, which is why they are often found in igneous rocks.

Pyriboles also have a high refractive index, which means they can be easily identified under a polarizing microscope. This is a useful tool for geologists to identify pyriboles in thin sections of rocks.

#### 1.3a.3 Occurrence of Pyriboles

Pyriboles are commonly found in igneous rocks, particularly in basalt and andesite. They are also found in some meteorites and can provide valuable insights into the conditions under which these rocks were formed.

In addition to their occurrence in igneous rocks, pyriboles can also be found in hydrothermal deposits. These deposits are formed when hot fluids, rich in minerals, flow through fractures in the Earth's crust. As the fluids cool and interact with the surrounding rocks, they can precipitate minerals, including pyriboles.

#### 1.3a.4 Petrogenetic Significance of Pyriboles

The presence of pyriboles in a rock can provide valuable information about the conditions under which the rock was formed. For example, the high melting point of pyriboles suggests that they were formed at high temperatures and pressures, which is consistent with their occurrence in igneous rocks.

Furthermore, the unique crystal structure of pyriboles can also provide insights into the composition of the melt from which the rock was formed. By studying the size and charge of the cations occupying the X, Y, and T sites, geologists can gain a better understanding of the conditions under which the melt was formed.

In conclusion, pyriboles are a fascinating group of minerals that can provide valuable insights into the formation of igneous rocks. Their unique crystal structure and properties make them a valuable tool for geologists in understanding the Earth's history.

#### 1.3b.1 Petrogenesis of Pyriboles

The formation of pyriboles is closely linked to the melting of the Earth's mantle. As the mantle is heated, it begins to melt, and the minerals within it start to break down. The breakdown of olivine, a common mineral in the mantle, is a key process in the formation of pyriboles.

As olivine breaks down, it releases silicon and oxygen atoms, which then combine to form pyriboles. The conditions under which this process occurs are typically high temperatures and pressures, similar to those found in the mantle.

#### 1.3b.2 Occurrence of Pyriboles in Igneous Rocks

Pyriboles are commonly found in basalt and andesite, which are both types of igneous rocks. These rocks are formed from the cooling and solidification of molten mantle material, and the presence of pyriboles can indicate the conditions under which this process occurred.

In addition to their occurrence in basalt and andesite, pyriboles can also be found in other types of igneous rocks, such as diorite and gabbro. These rocks are formed from the cooling and solidification of more evolved magmas, and the presence of pyriboles can provide insights into the processes that led to their formation.

#### 1.3b.3 Importance of Pyriboles in Igneous Petrology

Pyriboles play a crucial role in the study of igneous petrology. Their presence and abundance can provide valuable information about the conditions under which igneous rocks were formed. For example, the presence of pyriboles can indicate the depth at which the rock was formed, as well as the temperature and pressure conditions it experienced.

Furthermore, the study of pyriboles can also provide insights into the evolution of the Earth's mantle. By analyzing the composition and abundance of pyriboles in different types of igneous rocks, scientists can gain a better understanding of the processes that occur within the mantle and how they have changed over time.

In conclusion, pyriboles are an important group of minerals that play a crucial role in the study of igneous petrology. Their occurrence and abundance can provide valuable insights into the conditions under which igneous rocks were formed, as well as the evolution of the Earth's mantle.

### Section 2.1 Fractional Crystallization and Magma Mixing in Mid Ocean Ridge Basalts:

#### 2.1a Processes and mechanisms of fractional crystallization in MORBs

Fractional crystallization is a fundamental process in the evolution of mid ocean ridge basalts (MORBs). It is a process by which minerals with different melting points crystallize from a melt at different temperatures. This process is crucial in the formation of MORBs as it allows for the separation of minerals with different chemical compositions, leading to the formation of distinct layers within the basalt.

The process of fractional crystallization in MORBs can be understood through the concept of a phase diagram. A phase diagram is a graphical representation of the conditions under which a substance can exist in different phases. In the case of MORBs, the phase diagram can be used to determine the temperature at which different minerals will crystallize from the melt.

The phase diagram for MORBs is complex and depends on a variety of factors, including the composition of the melt, the pressure and temperature conditions, and the presence of volatiles. However, a general trend can be observed in the phase diagram for MORBs. As the temperature decreases, minerals with higher melting points will crystallize first, followed by minerals with lower melting points.

The process of fractional crystallization in MORBs can also be influenced by the presence of volatiles. Volatiles, such as water and carbon dioxide, can lower the melting point of the melt and promote the crystallization of minerals with lower melting points. This can lead to the formation of distinct layers within the basalt, with different minerals crystallizing at different depths.

In addition to fractional crystallization, another important process in the evolution of MORBs is magma mixing. Magma mixing occurs when different melts with different chemical compositions are combined, leading to the formation of a new melt with a unique chemical composition. This process can occur through various mechanisms, such as the mixing of melts from different sources or the mixing of melts with different degrees of fractional crystallization.

The study of fractional crystallization and magma mixing in MORBs is crucial in understanding the formation and evolution of these rocks. By studying the processes and mechanisms involved, we can gain insight into the conditions under which these rocks were formed and the factors that influenced their chemical composition. This knowledge is essential in understanding the role of MORBs in the Earth's mantle and their impact on the global carbon cycle.





### Subsection 2.1b Implications of magma mixing in MORBs

Magma mixing in mid ocean ridge basalts (MORBs) has significant implications for the chemical and mineralogical composition of the resulting basalt. As mentioned in the previous section, magma mixing can occur when different melts with different chemical compositions are combined, leading to the formation of a new melt with a unique chemical composition. This process can have a profound impact on the evolution of MORBs and their resulting petrology.

One of the most significant implications of magma mixing in MORBs is the potential for the formation of hybrid basalts. Hybrid basalts are a type of basalt that exhibits characteristics of both ocean island basalts (OIBs) and MORBs. This can occur when a MORB melt is mixed with a small amount of OIB melt, resulting in a basalt with a unique chemical composition that falls somewhere in between the two types. This can be seen in the Peach Spring Tuff, where the presence of both OIB and MORB characteristics suggests a potential for magma mixing.

Another implication of magma mixing in MORBs is the potential for the formation of layered basalts. As mentioned in the previous section, fractional crystallization can lead to the formation of distinct layers within the basalt. However, magma mixing can also contribute to the formation of these layers. For example, if a MORB melt is mixed with a melt from a nearby hydrothermal vent, the resulting basalt may exhibit layers with different mineral compositions, reflecting the different chemical compositions of the two melts.

Furthermore, magma mixing can also lead to the formation of more complex and diverse mineral assemblages in MORBs. As different melts are combined, they can bring with them different minerals and elements, leading to a more diverse and complex mineral assemblage in the resulting basalt. This can be seen in the Peach Spring Tuff, where the presence of a variety of minerals, including sanidine, plagioclase, biotite, amphibole, pyroxene, and the occasional quartz, suggests a potential for magma mixing.

In conclusion, magma mixing in MORBs has significant implications for the chemical and mineralogical composition of the resulting basalt. It can lead to the formation of hybrid basalts, layered basalts, and more diverse mineral assemblages, adding complexity and diversity to the already fascinating world of igneous petrology. 





### Subsection 2.2a Geochemical variations and trends in MORBs

The geochemical variations and trends in mid ocean ridge basalts (MORBs) are a result of the complex processes involved in their formation. As discussed in the previous section, magma mixing plays a significant role in the chemical composition of MORBs. However, other factors such as mantle melting, hydrothermal alteration, and volcanic gas emissions also contribute to the geochemical variations observed in MORBs.

One of the most significant geochemical variations in MORBs is the variation in silica content. The silica content of MORBs can range from 45-70%, with an average of around 55%. This variation is primarily due to the degree of mantle melting that occurs during the formation of MORBs. The more melting that occurs, the higher the silica content of the resulting basalt. This is because silica is one of the most abundant elements in the mantle, and as it is released during melting, it increases the silica content of the melt.

Another important geochemical trend in MORBs is the variation in iron content. Iron is a common element in the mantle, and its abundance in MORBs can provide valuable insights into the processes involved in their formation. The iron content of MORBs can vary significantly, with some basalts having iron contents as high as 3%. This variation is primarily due to the degree of hydrothermal alteration that occurs after the basalt is extruded. Hydrothermal alteration can increase the iron content of MORBs by introducing iron-rich minerals such as magnetite and hematite.

The geochemical variations in MORBs also extend to the volatile elements, such as water, carbon dioxide, and sulfur. These elements can have a significant impact on the chemical composition of MORBs and can provide valuable information about the processes involved in their formation. For example, the presence of water in MORBs can indicate the degree of melting that has occurred, as water is released during melting. Similarly, the presence of carbon dioxide and sulfur can provide insights into the volcanic processes involved in the formation of MORBs.

In addition to these geochemical variations, MORBs also exhibit trends in their mineral composition. For example, the presence of olivine and pyroxene can indicate the degree of melting that has occurred, as these minerals are more abundant in melts with lower silica contents. The presence of feldspar, on the other hand, can indicate a higher degree of melting and can also provide insights into the processes involved in the formation of MORBs.

Overall, the geochemical variations and trends in MORBs are complex and multifaceted, reflecting the complex processes involved in their formation. By studying these variations and trends, we can gain a better understanding of the processes that shape the Earth's crust and mantle. 





### Subsection 2.2b Sources and processes of mantle melting in MORBs

The mantle is the source of all basaltic magmas, and the process of mantle melting plays a crucial role in the formation of mid ocean ridge basalts (MORBs). The mantle is a complex system, and the melting process is influenced by a variety of factors, including temperature, pressure, and the composition of the mantle itself.

#### 2.2b Sources of Mantle Melting

The mantle is composed of a variety of materials, including peridotite, a rock rich in iron and magnesium. Peridotite is the primary source of mantle melting, and it is believed that the melting process begins when the mantle is heated to a temperature of approximately 1,200°C. This heating can occur due to a variety of factors, including the decay of radioactive elements, the release of heat from the core, and the movement of tectonic plates.

In addition to peridotite, other sources of mantle melting include subducted oceanic crust and sediment. As oceanic crust and sediment are subducted into the mantle, they can undergo partial melting, contributing to the overall composition of the mantle melt. This process is particularly important in the formation of MORBs, as it can introduce elements such as potassium and rubidium into the melt, which can significantly alter its chemical composition.

#### 2.2b Processes of Mantle Melting

The process of mantle melting is complex and involves a variety of physical and chemical processes. The first step in the melting process is the heating of the mantle, which can occur due to a variety of factors, as discussed above. Once the mantle reaches a temperature of approximately 1,200°C, it begins to melt, releasing a melt that is rich in iron and magnesium.

As the melt is released, it can interact with other materials in the mantle, such as subducted oceanic crust and sediment. This interaction can lead to the formation of new minerals and the introduction of additional elements into the melt. The composition of the resulting melt can vary significantly depending on the composition of the mantle and the materials it interacts with.

#### 2.2b Chemical Variations in MORBs

The chemical variations in MORBs are a result of the complex processes involved in their formation. The composition of the mantle melt can vary significantly depending on the source of the melt and the processes it undergoes. For example, MORBs from the Pacific Ocean have been found to have a higher silica content than those from the Atlantic Ocean, which is believed to be due to the presence of subducted oceanic crust and sediment in the Pacific Ocean.

In addition to variations in silica content, MORBs can also exhibit variations in other elements, such as iron, potassium, and rubidium. These variations can provide valuable insights into the processes involved in the formation of MORBs and the composition of the mantle.

#### 2.2b Graphical Representations of Mantle Melting in MORBs

The complex processes involved in mantle melting can be difficult to visualize, but graphical representations can provide a useful tool for understanding these processes. One such representation is the "mantle melting diagram," which plots the composition of the mantle melt against the composition of the mantle source. This diagram can help to illustrate the role of different sources and processes in the formation of MORBs.

Another useful graphical representation is the "mantle melting curve," which plots the temperature of the mantle against the composition of the mantle melt. This curve can help to illustrate the temperature at which different minerals and elements begin to melt, providing insight into the conditions under which mantle melting occurs.

In conclusion, the process of mantle melting plays a crucial role in the formation of mid ocean ridge basalts. The composition of the mantle melt can vary significantly depending on the source of the melt and the processes it undergoes, and graphical representations can provide a useful tool for understanding these complex processes. 





### Subsection 2.3a Phase equilibria and liquid compositions in MORB mantle melts

The composition of mantle melts is a crucial aspect of understanding the formation and evolution of mid ocean ridge basalts (MORBs). The composition of these melts is influenced by a variety of factors, including the source of the melt, the processes involved in its formation, and the phase equilibria of the melt.

#### 2.3a Phase Equilibria in MORB Mantle Melts

Phase equilibria refers to the conditions under which different phases of a substance can coexist in equilibrium. In the context of mantle melts, phase equilibria is particularly important as it can influence the composition of the melt and the formation of different minerals.

The phase equilibria of mantle melts is primarily controlled by temperature and pressure. As the mantle is heated, it can reach a temperature and pressure where it begins to melt. The composition of this melt can vary depending on the phase equilibria of the mantle. For example, if the mantle is at a high temperature and low pressure, it may melt to form a liquid-rich melt. However, if the mantle is at a lower temperature and higher pressure, it may melt to form a solid-rich melt.

The phase equilibria of mantle melts can also be influenced by the presence of different minerals. For example, the presence of olivine can stabilize the melt and prevent it from crystallizing. This can result in a more liquid-rich melt, which can have a significant impact on the composition of the melt.

#### 2.3a Liquid Compositions in MORB Mantle Melts

The composition of mantle melts can vary significantly depending on the phase equilibria of the melt. As mentioned earlier, the presence of different minerals can also influence the composition of the melt. For example, the presence of olivine can stabilize the melt and prevent it from crystallizing, resulting in a more liquid-rich melt.

The composition of mantle melts can also be influenced by the source of the melt. As discussed in the previous section, the mantle is composed of a variety of materials, including peridotite and subducted oceanic crust and sediment. The composition of these materials can significantly impact the composition of the melt.

In addition to the source of the melt, the processes involved in its formation can also influence its composition. For example, the melting of the mantle can occur through different processes, such as adiabatic melting or thermal melting. These processes can result in different compositions of the melt, depending on the temperature and pressure conditions.

#### 2.3a Graphical Representations of MORB Mantle Melts

Graphical representations, such as phase diagrams and liquid lines of descent, can be useful tools for understanding the phase equilibria and composition of mantle melts. These representations can show the conditions under which different phases can coexist and the composition of the melt at different stages of its formation.

For example, a phase diagram can show the temperature and pressure conditions at which different minerals can crystallize. This can help determine the composition of the melt at different stages of its formation and the impact of different minerals on the overall composition of the melt.

Liquid lines of descent, on the other hand, can show the evolution of the melt as it moves through the mantle. This can help determine the impact of different processes and sources on the composition of the melt.

In conclusion, the composition of mantle melts is a complex and dynamic process that is influenced by a variety of factors. Understanding the phase equilibria and liquid compositions of these melts is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of mid ocean ridge basalts. Graphical representations can be useful tools for visualizing and understanding these complex processes.





### Subsection 2.3b Thermodynamic models for MORB mantle melting

Thermodynamic models have been developed to understand the processes involved in the formation of mantle melts, particularly mid ocean ridge basalts (MORBs). These models take into account the effects of temperature, pressure, and composition on the phase equilibria of the melt.

#### 2.3b Thermodynamic Models for MORB Mantle Melting

Thermodynamic models for MORB mantle melting are based on the principles of thermodynamics, which describe the energy and entropy changes that occur during chemical reactions. These models can be used to predict the composition of the melt at different temperatures and pressures, and can also be used to understand the phase equilibria of the melt.

One of the most commonly used thermodynamic models for MORB mantle melting is the Peridotite Melting Evolution (PME) model. This model takes into account the effects of temperature, pressure, and composition on the phase equilibria of the melt. It also considers the effects of different minerals on the composition of the melt.

The PME model is based on the concept of a peridotite source, which is a rock composed primarily of olivine and pyroxene. This source is heated and pressurized, causing it to melt. The composition of the melt is then determined by the phase equilibria of the melt, which is influenced by temperature, pressure, and the presence of different minerals.

The PME model has been used to explain the formation of different types of MORBs, including normal MORBs and enriched MORBs. It has also been used to understand the effects of mantle plumes on the composition of MORBs.

#### 2.3b Thermodynamic Models for MORB Mantle Melting

Thermodynamic models for MORB mantle melting are also used to understand the effects of mantle plumes on the composition of MORBs. Mantle plumes are columns of hot, buoyant material that rise from the core-mantle boundary. These plumes can have a significant impact on the composition of MORBs, as they can introduce additional heat and melting into the mantle.

The PME model has been used to simulate the effects of mantle plumes on the composition of MORBs. These simulations have shown that mantle plumes can cause significant changes in the composition of MORBs, leading to the formation of enriched MORBs.

In conclusion, thermodynamic models have been crucial in our understanding of the formation and evolution of mantle melts, particularly MORBs. These models have allowed us to predict the composition of the melt at different temperatures and pressures, and have also helped us understand the phase equilibria of the melt. They have also been used to explain the effects of mantle plumes on the composition of MORBs. As our understanding of these processes continues to evolve, these models will play an increasingly important role in our understanding of the Earth's mantle.

The mantle is composed of a variety of minerals, including olivine, pyroxene, and feldspar. The relative amounts of these minerals can vary depending on the temperature, pressure, and composition of the mantle.

#### 2.4a Solid Compositions and Phase Equilibria in MORB Mantle Melts

The composition of the mantle can be determined by analyzing the phase equilibria of the melt. The phase equilibria of a system is the set of conditions under which different phases of a substance can coexist in equilibrium. In the case of the mantle, the phase equilibria can be determined by studying the melting behavior of the mantle source.

The melting behavior of the mantle source can be studied using thermodynamic models, such as the Peridotite Melting Evolution (PME) model. This model takes into account the effects of temperature, pressure, and composition on the phase equilibria of the melt. It also considers the effects of different minerals on the composition of the melt.

The PME model has been used to explain the formation of different types of MORBs, including normal MORBs and enriched MORBs. It has also been used to understand the effects of mantle plumes on the composition of MORBs.

### Subsection 2.5a Petrology and geochemistry of undersaturated magmas

Undersaturated magmas are a type of magma that is characterized by their low silica content. They are typically found in continental settings and are often associated with the formation of intrusive igneous complexes. In this section, we will explore the petrology and geochemistry of undersaturated magmas, with a focus on high-K continental magmas.

#### 2.5a Petrology and Geochemistry of Undersaturated Magmas

Undersaturated magmas are typically formed through the melting of the upper mantle, which has a relatively low silica content compared to the lower mantle. This results in a magma with a low silica content, which is often less than 55% by weight. The low silica content of these magmas is a key factor in their classification as undersaturated.

The petrology of undersaturated magmas is largely determined by their composition and the conditions under which they are formed. High-K continental magmas, for example, are characterized by their high potassium content and are often associated with the formation of granitic intrusions. These magmas are typically formed through the melting of the upper mantle, which is enriched in potassium compared to the lower mantle.

The geochemistry of undersaturated magmas is also important in their classification. High-K continental magmas, for example, are characterized by their high potassium content and their low silica content. This results in a high potassium to silica ratio, which is a key factor in their classification as high-K magmas. Other important geochemical characteristics of undersaturated magmas include their low iron and magnesium content, as well as their high calcium and sodium content.

The formation of undersaturated magmas is often associated with the presence of a subduction zone. As the oceanic crust is subducted into the mantle, it undergoes partial melting, resulting in the formation of undersaturated magmas. These magmas then rise to the surface and form volcanic arcs, which are commonly found in continental margins.

In addition to their role in the formation of volcanic arcs, undersaturated magmas also play a crucial role in the formation of continental crust. As these magmas rise to the surface, they undergo further melting and assimilation of surrounding rocks, resulting in the formation of granitic intrusions. These intrusions are important sources of heat and melting in the Earth's mantle, and their formation is closely linked to the evolution of the continents.

In conclusion, the petrology and geochemistry of undersaturated magmas, particularly high-K continental magmas, are crucial in understanding the formation of volcanic arcs and continental crust. Their low silica content and high potassium content make them distinct from other types of magmas, and their formation is closely linked to the presence of subduction zones and the evolution of the continents.

## Chapter 3: Metamorphic Rocks

 3.1: Metamorphic Rocks

Metamorphic rocks are an important part of the Earth's crust, and understanding their formation and characteristics is crucial for understanding the evolution of the Earth's crust. In this section, we will explore the basics of metamorphic rocks, including their definition and how they are formed.

#### 3.1a: Petrology and geochemistry of metamorphic rocks

Metamorphic rocks are rocks that have undergone changes in mineral composition and texture due to high temperatures and pressures. They are formed when rocks are subjected to extreme conditions, such as deep burial, subduction, or contact with magma. These conditions cause the rocks to undergo changes in mineral composition and texture, resulting in the formation of new rocks.

The formation of metamorphic rocks is driven by a combination of heat, pressure, and fluid flow. Heat is provided by the Earth's internal heat or by external sources such as magma. Pressure is exerted by the weight of overlying rocks or by the movement of tectonic plates. Fluid flow, often in the form of hydrothermal fluids, can also play a significant role in metamorphism.

There are three main types of metamorphic rocks: gneiss, schist, and amphibolite. Gneiss is a coarse-grained rock with a layered structure, often with alternating light and dark layers. Schist is a fine-grained rock with a preferred orientation of minerals, resulting in a distinct layering. Amphibolite is a dark, fine-grained rock with a high iron and magnesium content.

The processes that drive metamorphism result in the formation of different types of metamorphic rocks. For example, gneiss is often formed through the metamorphism of sedimentary rocks, while schist is commonly formed through the metamorphism of igneous rocks. Amphibolite is often formed through the metamorphism of basalt.

Metamorphic rocks are classified based on their mineral composition and texture. The most common classification system is the metamorphic facies, which are different zones of metamorphism that occur at different temperatures and pressures. These facies are often named after the dominant mineral present in the rock, such as greenschist facies, amphibolite facies, and eclogite facies.

The role of metamorphic rocks in the Earth's crust is crucial for understanding the recycling of the Earth's crust. Metamorphic rocks are often formed through the metamorphism of older rocks, resulting in the formation of new rocks. This process helps to replenish the Earth's crust and plays a significant role in the long-term evolution of the Earth's crust.

In addition to their role in the Earth's crust, metamorphic rocks also have economic significance. They are often used in construction and other industries due to their unique properties and aesthetic appeal. For example, gneiss is commonly used in building construction, while amphibolite is used in the production of ceramics.

In conclusion, metamorphic rocks are an essential part of the Earth's crust, and understanding their formation and characteristics is crucial for understanding the evolution of the Earth's crust. They are formed through a combination of heat, pressure, and fluid flow, and their unique properties make them valuable in various industries. In the next section, we will explore the different types of metamorphic rocks in more detail and discuss their unique characteristics.

Metamorphic rocks are formed through the transformation of older rocks, which are then returned to the surface through erosion. This process helps to replenish the Earth's crust and plays a significant role in the long-term evolution of the Earth's crust.

### Subsection 3.1b: Metamorphic processes and their effects on rock composition

Metamorphic processes are responsible for the changes in mineral composition and texture of rocks. These processes are driven by high temperatures and pressures, and can result in the formation of new minerals and the recrystallization of existing minerals.

One of the most common metamorphic processes is recrystallization, which occurs when minerals in a rock are replaced by new minerals with different chemical compositions. This process can result in the formation of new minerals, such as garnet or biotite, which are commonly found in metamorphic rocks.

Another important metamorphic process is metamorphic differentiation, which occurs when minerals with different chemical compositions separate from each other due to changes in temperature and pressure. This process can result in the formation of layers or zones within a metamorphic rock, with different mineral compositions.

Metamorphic processes can also result in the formation of new rocks, such as gneiss, schist, and amphibolite. These rocks are formed through the recrystallization of older rocks, and can have distinct layering and textures depending on the original rock type and the metamorphic conditions.

The effects of metamorphic processes on rock composition can be seen through the study of stable isotopes. Isotopic data from metamorphic rocks can provide valuable information about the metamorphic conditions and the original rock type. For example, the ratio of oxygen isotopes can indicate the temperature and pressure of metamorphism, while the ratio of hydrogen isotopes can provide information about the presence of fluids.

In conclusion, metamorphic processes play a crucial role in the evolution of the Earth's crust. Through the transformation of older rocks, metamorphic processes help to replenish the Earth's crust and play a significant role in the long-term evolution of the Earth's crust. The study of metamorphic rocks and their composition can provide valuable insights into the processes and conditions that shape our planet.

This results in a magma with a high potassium content, which is often greater than 1.5% by weight. The high potassium content of these magmas is a key factor in their classification as high potassium magmas.

The petrology of high potassium continental igneous rocks is largely determined by their composition and the conditions under which they are formed. These rocks are typically composed of quartz, feldspar, and mica, and are often associated with the formation of granitic intrusions. The high potassium content of these rocks is a result of the partial melting of the upper mantle, which is enriched in potassium compared to the lower mantle.

### Subsection 2.6a Origin and characteristics of kimberlites and carbonatites

Kimberlites and carbonatites are two unique types of igneous rocks that have distinct origins and characteristics. In this section, we will explore the origin and characteristics of these rocks, as well as their role in the formation of other igneous rocks.

#### 2.6a Origin of Kimberlites and Carbonatites

Kimberlites and carbonatites are both formed through the melting of the upper mantle, but their origins differ in several ways. Kimberlites are formed through the melting of the upper mantle due to the presence of a hot spot in the mantle, while carbonatites are formed through the melting of the upper mantle due to the presence of a subduction zone.

The hot spot responsible for the formation of kimberlites is thought to be a plume of hot material from the lower mantle that rises to the surface. This hot spot can be seen in the formation of the Great Rift Valley in East Africa, where the mantle plume is thought to have created a series of volcanic structures, including kimberlites.

Carbonatites, on the other hand, are formed through the melting of the upper mantle due to the presence of a subduction zone. As the oceanic crust is subducted into the mantle, it undergoes partial melting, resulting in the formation of carbonatites. This process is responsible for the formation of the Carbonatitic Complex in Mozambique, where the presence of a subduction zone is thought to have created a series of volcanic structures, including carbonatites.

#### 2.6a Characteristics of Kimberlites and Carbonatites

Kimberlites and carbonatites have distinct chemical and physical characteristics that set them apart from other igneous rocks. Kimberlites are typically highly silica-rich, with a high potassium and low iron and magnesium content. They also have a high density and are often found in association with other types of igneous rocks, such as basalt and granite.

Carbonatites, on the other hand, are characterized by their high carbon dioxide content and low silica content. They also have a high potassium and low iron and magnesium content, similar to kimberlites. However, carbonatites are typically more acidic than kimberlites and have a lower density.

The formation of kimberlites and carbonatites also plays a role in the formation of other igneous rocks. The melting of the upper mantle due to hot spots and subduction zones can result in the formation of other types of igneous rocks, such as basalt and granite. This process is known as differentiation, where the melting of the upper mantle results in the formation of different types of magmas with varying chemical and physical characteristics.

In conclusion, kimberlites and carbonatites are two unique types of igneous rocks with distinct origins and characteristics. Their formation through the melting of the upper mantle due to hot spots and subduction zones plays a crucial role in the formation of other igneous rocks and the overall understanding of igneous petrology.

In this chapter, we will delve into the topic of metamorphic rocks and their classification. Metamorphic rocks are formed when igneous or sedimentary rocks undergo changes in mineral composition, texture, and structure due to high temperatures and pressures. These changes can occur due to various processes such as metamorphism, recrystallization, and deformation. Understanding the classification of metamorphic rocks is crucial for geologists as it helps in identifying the origin and evolution of these rocks.

We will begin by discussing the basics of metamorphic rocks, including their formation and characteristics. We will then move on to explore the different types of metamorphic rocks, such as gneiss, schist, and amphibolite. Each type of metamorphic rock will be described in detail, including their mineral composition, texture, and structure. We will also discuss the factors that influence the formation of these rocks, such as temperature, pressure, and fluid content.

Furthermore, we will cover the classification of metamorphic rocks, which is based on the mineral composition and texture of the rocks. This classification is essential for understanding the origin and evolution of metamorphic rocks. We will also discuss the different types of metamorphic facies, which are used to classify metamorphic rocks based on their mineral assemblages.

Finally, we will explore the significance of metamorphic rocks in the Earth's history. Metamorphic rocks play a crucial role in the formation of mountains, as they are often found in the upper levels of the Earth's crust. They also provide valuable information about the conditions that existed during their formation, which can help in understanding the evolution of the Earth's crust.

In conclusion, this chapter will provide a comprehensive overview of metamorphic rocks and their classification. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the formation, characteristics, and significance of metamorphic rocks.

### Subsection 2.6b Petrogenesis and significance of untramafic magmas and komatiites

Untramafic magmas and komatiites are two important types of igneous rocks that have played a significant role in the evolution of the Earth's crust. In this section, we will explore the petrogenesis and significance of these rocks, as well as their role in the formation of other igneous rocks.

#### 2.6b Petrogenesis of Untramafic Magmas and Komatiites

Untramafic magmas and komatiites are both formed through the melting of the upper mantle, but their origins differ in several ways. Untramafic magmas are formed through the melting of the upper mantle due to the presence of a hot spot in the mantle, similar to kimberlites. However, unlike kimberlites, untramafic magmas are not associated with a plume of hot material from the lower mantle. Instead, they are thought to be formed through the melting of the upper mantle due to the presence of a hot spot in the mantle.

Komatiites, on the other hand, are formed through the melting of the upper mantle due to the presence of a subduction zone. As the oceanic crust is subducted into the mantle, it undergoes partial melting, resulting in the formation of komatiites. This process is responsible for the formation of the Kambalda type komatiitic nickel ore deposits, which are known for their high concentrations of nickel, copper, and platinum group elements.

#### 2.6b Significance of Untramafic Magmas and Komatiites

Untramafic magmas and komatiites have played a significant role in the evolution of the Earth's crust. The formation of these rocks has been linked to the formation of other igneous rocks, such as basalt and granite. The melting of the upper mantle due to hot spots and subduction zones has been a driving force in the formation of these rocks, and their presence has been linked to the formation of other igneous rocks.

Furthermore, the study of untramafic magmas and komatiites has provided valuable insights into the composition and evolution of the Earth's mantle. The presence of these rocks has been linked to the formation of other igneous rocks, such as basalt and granite, and their study has provided valuable information about the processes that drive the formation of these rocks.

In conclusion, untramafic magmas and komatiites are important types of igneous rocks that have played a significant role in the evolution of the Earth's crust. Their study has provided valuable insights into the composition and evolution of the Earth's mantle, and their presence has been linked to the formation of other igneous rocks. Further research on these rocks will continue to enhance our understanding of the Earth's mantle and its role in the formation of igneous rocks.

#### 2.7a Processes and consequences of magma mixing

Magma mixing is a fundamental process in the formation of igneous rocks. It occurs when two or more magmas with different compositions are combined, resulting in a new magma with a unique composition. This process can have significant consequences for the resulting rock, including changes in mineralogy, texture, and chemical composition.

#### 2.7a.1 Mechanisms of Magma Mixing

There are several mechanisms by which magma mixing can occur. One common mechanism is through the mixing of magmas in a magma chamber. As magmas are stored in a chamber, they can interact with each other, leading to the formation of new magmas with a composition that is a blend of the original magmas. This process can result in the formation of hybrid magmas, which have characteristics of both the parent magmas.

Another mechanism of magma mixing is through the mixing of magmas during eruption. As magma is extruded from a volcanic conduit, it can interact with other magmas, leading to the formation of new magmas. This process can result in the formation of layered or banded igneous rocks, where different layers or bands have distinct mineralogies and chemical compositions.

#### 2.7a.2 Consequences of Magma Mixing

The consequences of magma mixing can be significant. One of the most notable consequences is the formation of new minerals. As magmas with different compositions are mixed, they can react with each other, leading to the formation of new minerals that are not present in either of the parent magmas. This process can result in the formation of unique and complex mineral assemblages, which can provide valuable insights into the conditions under which the magmas were formed.

Magma mixing can also result in changes in the texture of the resulting rock. As magmas with different viscosities are mixed, they can interact with each other, leading to changes in the overall texture of the rock. This can result in the formation of rocks with distinct textural characteristics, such as porphyritic or aphanitic textures.

Furthermore, magma mixing can also result in changes in the chemical composition of the resulting rock. As magmas with different chemical compositions are mixed, they can interact with each other, leading to the formation of new minerals and altering the overall composition of the rock. This can result in the formation of rocks with distinct chemical signatures, which can be used to trace the origin of the magmas and their sources.

In conclusion, magma mixing is a complex and dynamic process that can have significant consequences for the resulting rock. It is a fundamental process in the formation of igneous rocks and plays a crucial role in the evolution of the Earth's crust.

 3.1: Metamorphic Rocks

Metamorphic rocks are formed when igneous or sedimentary rocks are subjected to high temperatures and pressures, resulting in changes in their mineral composition and texture. These changes can be caused by a variety of processes, including contact metamorphism, regional metamorphism, and hydrothermal metamorphism. Each of these processes can produce unique metamorphic rocks with their own distinct characteristics.

#### 3.1a: Classification of Metamorphic Rocks

Metamorphic rocks can be classified based on their mineral composition, texture, and the processes that formed them. The most common types of metamorphic rocks include gneiss, schist, and amphibolite.

Gneiss is a coarse-grained metamorphic rock that is characterized by its layered structure and the presence of large, elongated minerals. It is typically formed through regional metamorphism, where rocks are subjected to high temperatures and pressures over a large area. Gneiss can be further classified into different types based on its mineral composition, such as biotite gneiss, muscovite gneiss, and sillimanite gneiss.

Schist is a fine-grained metamorphic rock that is characterized by its layered structure and the presence of thin, elongated minerals. It is typically formed through regional metamorphism, but can also be formed through contact metamorphism. Schist can be further classified into different types based on its mineral composition, such as biotite schist, muscovite schist, and chlorite schist.

Amphibolite is a dark, fine-grained metamorphic rock that is characterized by its high iron and magnesium content. It is typically formed through regional metamorphism, but can also be formed through contact metamorphism. Amphibolite can be further classified into different types based on its mineral composition, such as hornblende amphibolite and plagioclase amphibolite.

In addition to these common types, there are also other less abundant metamorphic rocks such as eclogite, kyanite gneiss, and sillimanite schist. These rocks are typically formed through high-pressure metamorphism and are characterized by their unique mineral assemblages.

Overall, the classification of metamorphic rocks is important in understanding their formation and characteristics.

In addition to these common types, there are also other less abundant metamorphic rocks such as eclogite, kyanite gneiss, and sillimanite schist. These rocks are typically formed through high-pressure metamorphism and are characterized by their unique mineral assemblages.

#### 3.1b: Metamorphic Processes

As mentioned earlier, metamorphic rocks can be formed through various processes, including contact metamorphism, regional metamorphism, and hydrothermal metamorphism. Each of these processes can produce distinct metamorphic rocks with their own characteristics.

Contact metamorphism occurs when a hot, igneous intrusion comes into contact with a surrounding sedimentary or igneous rock. The high temperatures and pressures from the intrusion cause the surrounding rock to undergo metamorphism, resulting in the formation of a new rock with a different mineral composition and texture. This process is commonly observed in the formation of gneiss and amphibolite.

Regional metamorphism, on the other hand, occurs when a large area of rock is subjected to high temperatures and pressures. This can be caused by various factors, such as plate movements, volcanic activity, and changes in sea level. Regional metamorphism can produce a variety of metamorphic rocks, including gneiss, schist, and amphibolite.

Hydrothermal metamorphism is a process that occurs when hot fluids, such as magmatic or hydrothermal fluids, interact with a surrounding rock. These fluids can cause the rock to undergo metamorphism, resulting in the formation of new minerals and textures. This process is commonly observed in the formation of hydrothermal alteration assemblages, which can include minerals such as alunite, gypsum, and hematite.

#### 3.1c: Metamorphic Minerals

Metamorphic rocks are characterized by their unique mineral assemblages, which are a result of the high temperatures and pressures they undergo. Some common metamorphic minerals include biotite, muscovite, hornblende, and plagioclase.

Biotite is a common mineral found in gneiss and schist. It is a dark, mica-like mineral that is characterized by its layered structure and high potassium content. Biotite is commonly found in rocks that have undergone regional metamorphism.

Muscovite is another common mineral found in gneiss and schist. It is a light, mica-like mineral that is characterized by its layered structure and high potassium content. Muscovite is commonly found in rocks that have undergone regional metamorphism.

Hornblende is a dark, amphibole mineral that is commonly found in amphibolite. It is characterized by its high iron and magnesium content and is commonly found in rocks that have undergone regional metamorphism.

Plagioclase is a common mineral found in amphibolite. It is a light, feldspar mineral that is characterized by its high calcium content. Plagioclase is commonly found in rocks that have undergone contact metamorphism.

#### 3.1d: Metamorphic Textures

In addition to their mineral composition, metamorphic rocks are also characterized by their unique textures. These textures are a result of the high temperatures and pressures they undergo and can provide valuable information about the processes that formed them.

Coarse-grained textures, such as those found in gneiss, are a result of high-grade metamorphism. This occurs when rocks are subjected to high temperatures and pressures, causing the minerals to grow and align in a specific direction. Fine-grained textures, such as those found in schist, are a result of low-grade metamorphism. This occurs when rocks are subjected to lower temperatures and pressures, resulting in smaller, randomly oriented minerals.

#### 3.1e: Metamorphic Rocks in the Earth's History

Metamorphic rocks play a crucial role in the Earth's history, as they can provide valuable information about past tectonic events and climate conditions. For example, the presence of certain metamorphic minerals can indicate the temperature and pressure conditions that the rock was subjected to. This information can then be used to reconstruct the tectonic history of a region.

Additionally, metamorphic rocks can also provide insight into the Earth's climate history. By studying the mineral composition and textures of metamorphic rocks, scientists can determine the temperature and pressure conditions that the rock was subjected to. This information can then be used to infer the climate conditions that existed during the time of metamorphism.

In conclusion, metamorphic rocks are an important aspect of igneous petrology. They are formed through various processes, such as contact metamorphism, regional metamorphism, and hydrothermal metamorphism. These rocks are characterized by their unique mineral assemblages, textures, and can provide valuable information about the Earth's history.

#### 2.7b Crustal assimilation in igneous systems

Crustal assimilation is a fundamental process in the formation of igneous rocks. It occurs when a magma incorporates the surrounding crustal rocks, resulting in a new magma with a unique composition. This process can have significant consequences for the resulting rock, including changes in mineralogy, texture, and chemical composition.

#### 2.7b.1 Mechanisms of Crustal Assimilation

There are several mechanisms by which crustal assimilation can occur. One common mechanism is through the mixing of magmas and crustal rocks in a magma chamber. As magmas are stored in a chamber, they can interact with the surrounding crustal rocks, leading to the formation of new magmas with a composition that is a blend of the original magmas and the crustal rocks. This process can result in the formation of hybrid magmas, which have characteristics of both the parent magmas and the crustal rocks.

Another mechanism of crustal assimilation is through the mixing of magmas and crustal rocks during eruption. As magma is extruded from a volcanic conduit, it can interact with the surrounding crustal rocks, leading to the formation of new magmas. This process can result in the formation of layered or banded igneous rocks, where different layers or bands have distinct mineralogies and chemical compositions.

#### 2.7b.2 Consequences of Crustal Assimilation

The consequences of crustal assimilation can be significant. One of the most notable consequences is the formation of new minerals. As magmas and crustal rocks interact, they can react with each other, leading to the formation of new minerals that are not present in either the magma or the crustal rock alone. This process can result in the formation of unique and complex mineral assemblages, which can provide valuable insights into the conditions under which the magmas were formed.

Crustal assimilation can also result in changes in the texture of the resulting rock. As magmas and crustal rocks interact, they can alter the viscosity of the magma, leading to changes in the overall texture of the rock. This can result in the formation of rocks with distinct textures, which can be used to identify the source of the magma.

In addition, crustal assimilation can also lead to changes in the chemical composition of the resulting rock. As magmas and crustal rocks interact, they can exchange elements and compounds, leading to changes in the chemical composition of the magma. This can result in the formation of rocks with distinct chemical signatures, which can be used to trace the origin of the magma.

Overall, crustal assimilation is a crucial process in the formation of igneous rocks. It can result in the formation of unique and complex rocks, providing valuable insights into the conditions under which the magmas were formed. Understanding the mechanisms and consequences of crustal assimilation is essential for understanding the formation of igneous rocks and their role in the Earth's evolution.




#### 2.8a Petrologic and geochemical features of mafic igneous systems

Mafic igneous systems are characterized by their high magnesium and iron content, and their low silica content. They are typically formed through the differentiation of a parent magma, and can provide valuable insights into the conditions under which the magma was formed.

#### 2.8a.1 Petrologic Features of Mafic Igneous Systems

The petrologic features of mafic igneous systems are largely determined by the composition of the parent magma and the conditions under which it was formed. As mentioned earlier, the composition of the parent magma can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the composition of the mantle, the presence of crustal rocks, and the effects of metamorphism.

One of the key petrologic features of mafic igneous systems is the presence of olivine. Olivine is a common mineral in mafic igneous rocks, and its presence can indicate the high magnesium content of the parent magma. The presence of olivine can also provide insights into the conditions under which the magma was formed, as olivine is stable at high temperatures and pressures.

Another important petrologic feature of mafic igneous systems is the presence of pyroxene. Pyroxene is a common mineral in mafic igneous rocks, and its presence can indicate the high iron content of the parent magma. The presence of pyroxene can also provide insights into the conditions under which the magma was formed, as pyroxene is stable at high temperatures and pressures.

#### 2.8a.2 Geochemical Features of Mafic Igneous Systems

The geochemical features of mafic igneous systems are largely determined by the composition of the parent magma and the conditions under which it was formed. As mentioned earlier, the composition of the parent magma can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the composition of the mantle, the presence of crustal rocks, and the effects of metamorphism.

One of the key geochemical features of mafic igneous systems is the high magnesium and iron content of the rocks. This is a direct result of the high magnesium and iron content of the parent magma. The high magnesium and iron content can be indicative of the conditions under which the magma was formed, as these elements are typically more abundant in mantle-derived magmas than in crustal-derived magmas.

Another important geochemical feature of mafic igneous systems is the low silica content of the rocks. This is a result of the differentiation of the parent magma, which typically results in the separation of a silica-rich melt and a magnesium-rich melt. The low silica content can provide insights into the conditions under which the magma was formed, as silica is typically more soluble in melt than in solid rock.

#### 2.8a.3 Graphical Representations of Mafic Igneous Systems

Graphical representations, such as phase diagrams and mineral assemblage diagrams, can be useful tools for understanding the petrologic and geochemical features of mafic igneous systems. These diagrams can help to visualize the conditions under which the parent magma was formed, and can provide insights into the composition and evolution of the magma.

Phase diagrams, for example, can help to illustrate the stability of different minerals and melts under varying conditions of temperature and pressure. By plotting the stability of different minerals and melts on a phase diagram, it is possible to determine the conditions under which a particular mineral or melt is stable. This can provide valuable insights into the conditions under which the parent magma was formed.

Mineral assemblage diagrams, on the other hand, can help to illustrate the composition of a rock based on the minerals present. By plotting the composition of different minerals on a mineral assemblage diagram, it is possible to determine the composition of the rock. This can be particularly useful for understanding the evolution of a mafic igneous system, as the composition of the rock can change as the magma evolves.

In conclusion, the petrologic and geochemical features of mafic igneous systems are largely determined by the composition of the parent magma and the conditions under which it was formed. By studying these features, it is possible to gain valuable insights into the formation and evolution of mafic igneous systems. Graphical representations, such as phase diagrams and mineral assemblage diagrams, can be useful tools for understanding these features.




#### 2.8b Mantle sources and processes of mafic magmas

The mantle is a crucial source of mafic magmas, which are characterized by their high magnesium and iron content. The mantle is a vast reservoir of molten rock, or magma, that lies beneath the Earth's crust. It is composed of two main layers: the upper mantle and the lower mantle. The upper mantle is further divided into the lithosphere and the asthenosphere.

The lithosphere is the rigid outer shell of the Earth, composed of the crust and the uppermost mantle. It is about 100 km thick and is broken into several large and small plates that float on the asthenosphere. The lithosphere plays a significant role in the formation of mafic magmas. When the lithosphere is subducted into the mantle, it can undergo partial melting, leading to the formation of mafic magmas.

The asthenosphere, on the other hand, is a more ductile layer of the upper mantle. It is thought to be the source of heat and melting that drives plate tectonics. The asthenosphere is also a potential source of mafic magmas. When the asthenosphere is heated by the core or by the lithosphere, it can undergo partial melting, leading to the formation of mafic magmas.

The mantle plume hypothesis is another important concept in the study of mafic magmas. According to this hypothesis, plumes of hot material from the core-mantle boundary can rise through the mantle and reach the surface, leading to the formation of hotspots and mafic magmas. These plumes can also interact with the lithosphere and the asthenosphere, influencing the composition of the resulting magmas.

The study of mantle sources and processes of mafic magmas is a complex and ongoing field of research. It involves the use of various techniques, including geochemical analysis, seismic tomography, and volcanological observations. By understanding the mantle sources and processes of mafic magmas, we can gain valuable insights into the dynamics of the Earth's interior and the formation of igneous rocks.

#### 2.8c Mafic differentiation and the formation of mafic igneous systems

Mafic differentiation is a key process in the formation of mafic igneous systems. It refers to the separation of different minerals and melts within a magma based on their chemical and physical properties. This process is driven by the cooling and crystallization of the magma, which can lead to the formation of distinct layers or layers of different minerals.

The process of mafic differentiation can be understood in terms of the phase rule, which states that the number of degrees of freedom in a system is equal to the number of components minus the number of phases plus two. In the context of mafic differentiation, the components represent the different minerals and melts present in the magma, and the phases represent the different states of matter (liquid, solid, or gas).

As the magma cools and crystallizes, the number of degrees of freedom decreases, leading to the separation of different minerals and melts. This process can be represented graphically using a phase diagram, which shows the conditions under which different phases can coexist in a system. For example, the phase diagram for a typical mafic magma might show the conditions under which olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase feldspar can coexist.

The formation of mafic igneous systems through mafic differentiation is a complex process that involves a variety of factors, including the composition of the magma, the cooling rate, and the pressure and temperature conditions. These factors can influence the timing and extent of differentiation, as well as the composition of the resulting layers.

For example, the formation of the Skaergaard intrusion, a well-studied example of a mafic igneous system, involved the differentiation of a basaltic magma into distinct layers of olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase feldspar. This differentiation was driven by the cooling and crystallization of the magma, which occurred over a period of several million years.

The study of mafic differentiation and the formation of mafic igneous systems is a crucial aspect of igneous petrology. It provides insights into the processes that occur within the Earth's mantle and the formation of different types of igneous rocks. By understanding these processes, we can gain a deeper understanding of the dynamics of the Earth's interior and the evolution of the Earth's crust.

### Conclusion

#### 2.9a Effects of water on fractional crystallization

Water plays a crucial role in the fractional crystallization process. It can significantly influence the crystallization behavior of minerals and the overall composition of the resulting magma. The presence of water can alter the melting behavior of minerals, leading to changes in the crystallization sequence and the composition of the resulting magmas.

##### Water and Melting Behavior

Water can significantly lower the melting point of minerals, making them more prone to melting. This is particularly important in the case of silicate minerals, which are common in the Earth's mantle. The presence of water can cause these minerals to melt at lower temperatures, leading to the formation of a more fluid melt. This can have significant implications for the crystallization process, as it can alter the crystallization sequence and the composition of the resulting magmas.

##### Water and Crystallization Sequence

The presence of water can also alter the crystallization sequence of minerals. In general, minerals with higher melting points crystallize first, followed by minerals with lower melting points. However, the presence of water can disrupt this sequence. For example, the presence of water can cause olivine, a common mineral in the upper mantle, to crystallize at lower temperatures than it would in the absence of water. This can lead to the early crystallization of olivine, which can have significant implications for the composition of the resulting magmas.

##### Water and Composition of Magmas

The presence of water can also significantly alter the composition of magmas. Water can be incorporated into the melt as it forms, leading to the formation of hydrous magmas. These magmas can have significantly different compositions than anhydrous magmas, with higher silica and aluminum contents. The presence of water can also lead to the formation of new minerals, such as amphiboles and micas, which can significantly alter the mineralogy of the resulting igneous rocks.

In conclusion, water plays a crucial role in the fractional crystallization process. It can significantly alter the melting behavior of minerals, the crystallization sequence, and the composition of the resulting magmas. Understanding the effects of water on fractional crystallization is crucial for understanding the formation of igneous rocks and the evolution of the Earth's mantle.

#### 2.9b Wet vs. dry fractional crystallization

Fractional crystallization can occur in both wet and dry conditions. The presence or absence of water can significantly influence the crystallization process and the resulting composition of the magma.

##### Wet Fractional Crystallization

Wet fractional crystallization occurs when water is present in the melt. As discussed in the previous section, water can significantly lower the melting point of minerals, leading to the formation of a more fluid melt. This fluid melt can then undergo fractional crystallization, with minerals crystallizing in order of decreasing melting point. The presence of water can also alter the crystallization sequence, with minerals crystallizing at lower temperatures than they would in the absence of water.

The presence of water can also significantly alter the composition of the resulting magma. Water can be incorporated into the melt as it forms, leading to the formation of hydrous magmas. These magmas can have significantly different compositions than anhydrous magmas, with higher silica and aluminum contents. The presence of water can also lead to the formation of new minerals, such as amphiboles and micas, which can significantly alter the mineralogy of the resulting igneous rocks.

##### Dry Fractional Crystallization

Dry fractional crystallization, on the other hand, occurs when water is absent from the melt. In these conditions, minerals crystallize in order of increasing melting point. The absence of water can lead to a more viscous melt, which can slow down the crystallization process and lead to the formation of larger crystals.

The composition of the resulting magma can also be different in dry fractional crystallization compared to wet fractional crystallization. Without the influence of water, the magma will have a lower silica and aluminum content, and will be more likely to form mafic igneous rocks.

In conclusion, the presence or absence of water can significantly influence the crystallization process and the resulting composition of the magma. Understanding the differences between wet and dry fractional crystallization is crucial for understanding the formation of igneous rocks and the evolution of the Earth's mantle.

#### 2.9c Implications of wet vs. dry fractional crystallization

The implications of wet and dry fractional crystallization are far-reaching and have significant impacts on the composition and mineralogy of igneous rocks. 

##### Implications of Wet Fractional Crystallization

Wet fractional crystallization, as discussed in the previous section, can lead to the formation of hydrous magmas. These magmas can have significantly different compositions than anhydrous magmas, with higher silica and aluminum contents. The presence of water can also lead to the formation of new minerals, such as amphiboles and micas, which can significantly alter the mineralogy of the resulting igneous rocks.

Moreover, the presence of water can also influence the crystallization sequence. Minerals can crystallize at lower temperatures than they would in the absence of water, leading to a more rapid crystallization process. This can have implications for the texture and structure of the resulting igneous rocks, as well as the timing of magmatic events.

##### Implications of Dry Fractional Crystallization

Dry fractional crystallization, on the other hand, can lead to the formation of more mafic igneous rocks. The absence of water can lead to a more viscous melt, which can slow down the crystallization process and lead to the formation of larger crystals. This can result in a more coarse-grained texture in the resulting igneous rocks.

Furthermore, the absence of water can also lead to a lower silica and aluminum content in the magma. This can have implications for the mineralogy of the resulting igneous rocks, as well as their physical and chemical properties.

In conclusion, the implications of wet and dry fractional crystallization are complex and multifaceted. They can significantly influence the composition, mineralogy, and texture of igneous rocks, as well as the timing of magmatic events. Understanding these implications is crucial for interpreting the geological history of igneous rocks and their role in the evolution of the Earth's mantle.

#### 2.9b Comparison of wet and dry fractional crystallization processes

Fractional crystallization is a fundamental process in the evolution of magmas, and it can occur in both wet and dry environments. The presence of water can significantly influence the crystallization process, leading to differences in the resulting magmas. In this section, we will compare and contrast the wet and dry fractional crystallization processes.

##### Wet Fractional Crystallization

Wet fractional crystallization occurs in the presence of water. As discussed in the previous section, water can significantly alter the melting behavior of minerals, leading to changes in the crystallization sequence and the composition of the resulting magmas. 

In wet fractional crystallization, the presence of water can cause minerals to crystallize at lower temperatures than they would in the absence of water. This can lead to the early crystallization of certain minerals, which can significantly influence the composition of the resulting magmas. 

Moreover, the presence of water can also lead to the formation of hydrous magmas, which can have significantly different compositions than anhydrous magmas. These hydrous magmas can have higher silica and aluminum contents, and they can also contain new minerals, such as amphiboles and micas, which can significantly alter the properties of the resulting magmas.

##### Dry Fractional Crystallization

Dry fractional crystallization, on the other hand, occurs in the absence of water. In this process, minerals crystallize at higher temperatures than they would in the presence of water. This can lead to a different crystallization sequence, which can result in a different composition of the resulting magmas.

In dry fractional crystallization, the absence of water can lead to the formation of anhydrous magmas, which can have different properties than hydrous magmas. These anhydrous magmas can have lower silica and aluminum contents, and they can also contain different minerals than hydrous magmas.

##### Comparison and Contrast

In summary, wet and dry fractional crystallization processes can lead to different results due to the influence of water. Wet fractional crystallization can lead to the formation of hydrous magmas with higher silica and aluminum contents, while dry fractional crystallization can lead to the formation of anhydrous magmas with lower silica and aluminum contents. The presence of water can also lead to the formation of new minerals, which can significantly alter the properties of the resulting magmas. 

Understanding the differences between wet and dry fractional crystallization processes is crucial for interpreting the composition and evolution of magmas. It can also provide insights into the role of water in the Earth's mantle and the formation of different types of volcanic rocks.

This process is driven by the presence of water in the magma, which can significantly alter the melting behavior and mineralogy of the system. In this section, we will explore the petrology and geochemistry of hydrous differentiation, with a focus on the role of amphibole.

Amphibole is a common mineral found in many igneous rocks. It is a hydrous silicate with a complex crystal structure, and its presence can significantly influence the petrology and geochemistry of a system. Amphibole is typically found in rocks that have undergone hydrous differentiation, and its abundance can provide valuable insights into the conditions under which the rock was formed.

The presence of amphibole in a rock can be indicative of high-grade metamorphism. This is because amphibole is stable at high temperatures and pressures, and its presence can suggest that the rock has been subjected to these conditions. This is supported by stable isotope data from various locations within the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which has shown the presence of mafic-to-felsic intrusive igneous rocks with high-grade metamorphism due to the presence of magmatic water.

The isotopic signature of magmatic water can also provide valuable information about the conditions under which the rock was formed. Isotopic studies of magmatic water have shown similarities to meteoric water, indicating circulation of magmatic and meteoric groundwater systems. This can be further supported by the analysis of fluid inclusions, which can provide a wide range of δ<sup>18</sup>O and δ<sup>2</sup>H content.

The presence of amphibole can also be indicative of the presence of water in the system. Amphibole is a hydrous mineral, and its abundance can suggest that the magma was saturated with water. This can have significant implications for the melting behavior and mineralogy of the system. For example, the presence of amphibole can indicate that the magma was undergoing hydrous differentiation, with the amphibole crystallizing from a melt that was enriched in water.

In conclusion, the petrology and geochemistry of hydrous differentiation are crucial in understanding the formation of igneous rocks. The presence of amphibole can provide valuable insights into the conditions under which the rock was formed, and its abundance can be indicative of high-grade metamorphism and the presence of water in the system. Further research in this area can continue to enhance our understanding of the significance of hydrous differentiation in igneous petrology.

## Metamorphism

The protolith is a spinel-clouded plagioclase metamorphosed gabbro (metagabbro). Metamorphism took place during the Ottawan phase of the Grenville orogeny, when crustal thickening was occurring. The peak temperature of metamorphism was notably high, being over 900 °C. Peak pressure was also quite high, ranging from 9-10 kbar. The metamorphosis of the protolith into garnet amphibolite is marked by orogenic folding and plastic flow, as well as a hydration phase. Garnet growth, introduction of fluid, retrograde metamorphism, and ductile deformation all occurred simultaneously. The fluid flow was likely channelized, as evidence from the large variability in trace elements. Fluid flow induced ion mobility and plasticity, as well as enriching the whole rock chemistry with lithium and thorium and depleting cesium. 

Aside from the introduction of fluids, metamorphic transformation was isochemical as evidenced by the homogeneity of the garnets. Having all chemical constituents continuously available and constant pressure and temperature conditions during formation is most likely what allowed isochemical transformation and homogeneity in the garnets. The garnets underwent two growth phases and one reabsorption phase. The first growth phase was homogenous, while the second phase was marked by the enrichment of yttrium and titanium in the garnets. In the reabsorption phase, garnets partitioned yttrium but were depleted in titanium. Two periods of cooling occurred, a fast one (91 °C/Ma) and a slow one (26 °C/Ma). Advection dominated cooling happened during topography driven lower crustal flow, while conduction dominated cooling happened one flow stopped.

## Petrological description

The rock formation that bears the large garnets in Gore Mountain is an amphibolite that has been enriched in yttrium and lithium.

### Section: 3.2 Hydrous Mantle Melting - Phase Equilibrium Controls on Liquid Compositions:

#### 3.2a Phase equilibria and liquid compositions in hydrous mantle melting

Hydrous mantle melting is a complex process that involves the interaction of various phases and their equilibrium. The composition of the resulting liquid is largely controlled by the phase equilibrium of these phases. In this section, we will explore the phase equilibria and liquid compositions in hydrous mantle melting.

#### 3.2a Phase equilibria and liquid compositions in hydrous mantle melting

The phase equilibrium in hydrous mantle melting is governed by the thermodynamic properties of the phases involved. These phases include olivine, pyroxene, plagioclase, and mica, among others. The equilibrium between these phases is determined by the temperature, pressure, and water content of the system.

The phase diagrams of these minerals provide a useful tool for understanding the phase equilibrium in hydrous mantle melting. For example, the phase diagram of olivine shows that it is stable at high temperatures and pressures, and it breaks down to form spinel and forsterite at lower temperatures and pressures. This breakdown can occur in the presence of water, leading to the formation of hydrous olivine phases.

The phase diagram of pyroxene, on the other hand, shows that it is stable at lower temperatures and pressures than olivine. It breaks down to form feldspar and mica at higher temperatures and pressures. This breakdown can also occur in the presence of water, leading to the formation of hydrous pyroxene phases.

The phase diagram of plagioclase shows that it is stable at intermediate temperatures and pressures, and it breaks down to form mica and quartz at higher temperatures and pressures. This breakdown can occur in the presence of water, leading to the formation of hydrous plagioclase phases.

The phase diagram of mica shows that it is stable at lower temperatures and pressures than plagioclase. It breaks down to form quartz and muscovite at higher temperatures and pressures. This breakdown can occur in the presence of water, leading to the formation of hydrous mica phases.

The equilibrium between these phases is determined by the temperature, pressure, and water content of the system. As the temperature and pressure increase, the equilibrium shifts towards the more stable phases. The presence of water can also affect the equilibrium, leading to the formation of hydrous phases.

The composition of the resulting liquid is largely controlled by the phase equilibrium of these phases. The liquid is enriched in the elements that are more soluble in the liquid phase, and it is depleted in the elements that are more soluble in the solid phase. This can lead to significant variations in the composition of the liquid, depending on the phase equilibrium of the system.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of these phase equilibria and liquid compositions for the petrology of hydrous mantle melts.

#### 3.2b Implications of phase equilibria for melt evolution

The phase equilibria of hydrous mantle melting have significant implications for the evolution of the resulting melt. The phase equilibria determine the composition of the melt, which in turn influences its physical and chemical properties. 

The phase equilibria of olivine, pyroxene, plagioclase, and mica can lead to the formation of hydrous phases. These hydrous phases can significantly alter the composition of the melt. For example, the formation of hydrous olivine phases can increase the water content of the melt, leading to a more fluid and mobile melt. Similarly, the formation of hydrous pyroxene phases can increase the water content and alter the silicate composition of the melt.

The phase equilibria can also lead to the formation of new phases. For example, the breakdown of olivine to form spinel and forsterite can lead to the formation of new phases. This can further alter the composition of the melt and influence its physical and chemical properties.

The phase equilibria can also influence the melting behavior of the mantle. The presence of water can lower the melting point of the mantle, leading to increased melting. This can result in the formation of larger volumes of melt and the formation of more fluid and mobile melts.

In summary, the phase equilibria of hydrous mantle melting have significant implications for the evolution of the resulting melt. They influence the composition, physical and chemical properties, and melting behavior of the melt. Understanding these implications is crucial for understanding the petrology of hydrous mantle melts.

#### 3.2c Case studies of hydrous mantle melting

In this section, we will explore some case studies that illustrate the principles discussed in the previous sections. These case studies will provide a more concrete understanding of the phase equilibria and melt evolution in hydrous mantle melting.

##### Case Study 1: The Hawaiian Islands

The Hawaiian Islands provide a unique opportunity to study hydrous mantle melting. The Hawaiian hotspot, located in the Earth's mantle, is responsible for the formation of these islands. The hotspot melts the oceanic crust above it, leading to the formation of basaltic magmas. These magmas then rise to the surface and form the Hawaiian Islands.

The composition of these magmas is largely controlled by the phase equilibria of the mantle. The presence of water in the mantle can significantly alter the composition of these magmas. For example, the presence of water can increase the water content of the melt, leading to a more fluid and mobile melt. This can result in the formation of larger volumes of melt and the formation of more fluid and mobile melts.

##### Case Study 2: The Mid-Atlantic Ridge

The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is another location where hydrous mantle melting can be studied. The ridge is a divergent plate boundary where the Earth's mantle is being pulled apart. This process can lead to the formation of new oceanic crust and the melting of the mantle.

The phase equilibria of the mantle can influence the composition of the resulting melt. For example, the formation of hydrous phases can increase the water content and alter the silicate composition of the melt. This can further alter the physical and chemical properties of the melt.

##### Case Study 3: The Selli Event

The Selli Event, a major oceanic anoxic event (OAE) that occurred approximately 120 million years ago, provides another example of hydrous mantle melting. The event was characterized by a spike in marine productivity, likely driven by an increase in iron availability. This increase in iron availability was likely due to the release of hydrogen sulfide from sulfate-reducing bacteria, which reacted with iron to form iron sulfide.

The phase equilibria of the mantle can influence the composition of the resulting melt. For example, the formation of hydrous phases can increase the water content and alter the silicate composition of the melt. This can further alter the physical and chemical properties of the melt.

In conclusion, these case studies illustrate the importance of understanding the phase equilibria and melt evolution in hydrous mantle melting. They provide a more concrete understanding of the principles discussed in the previous sections and highlight the need for further research in this area.

### Introduction

Water, the universal solvent, plays a pivotal role in the realm of igneous processes. This chapter, "The Role of Water in Igneous Processes," aims to delve into the intricate relationship between water and igneous rocks, exploring how water influences their formation, evolution, and transformation.

The Earth's mantle, a region of solid rock beneath the crust, is primarily composed of silicate minerals. When these minerals melt, they form magma, the molten rock from which igneous rocks are born. The process of melting, or partial melting, is a complex interplay of temperature, pressure, and chemical reactions. Water, in its various forms, plays a crucial role in this process. It can either facilitate or hinder the melting of mantle rocks, thereby influencing the composition and characteristics of the resulting igneous rocks.

Moreover, water can also be a key player in the metamorphism of igneous rocks. Metamorphism, the process by which rocks change from one form to another due to changes in temperature and pressure, can be influenced by the presence of water. Water can act as a catalyst, promoting the recrystallization of minerals and the formation of new ones, thereby transforming the original igneous rock into a new metamorphic rock.

In this chapter, we will explore these aspects in detail, providing a comprehensive understanding of the role of water in igneous processes.

### Subsection: 3.3a Phase relations and petrogenetic processes in felsic magmas

Felsic magmas, also known as silicic magmas, are a type of magma that is rich in silica and have a high viscosity. They are commonly associated with explosive volcanic activity and the formation of volcanic ash and pumice. In this section, we will explore the phase relations and petrogenetic processes that occur in felsic magmas.

#### Phase Relations in Felsic Magmas

The phase relations in felsic magmas are complex and depend on a variety of factors, including the composition of the magma, the pressure and temperature conditions, and the presence of volatiles. At high temperatures and pressures, felsic magmas are typically molten and consist of a single phase. However, as the magma cools and decompresses, it can undergo changes in phase, leading to the formation of different minerals.

One of the key phase relations in felsic magmas is the crystallization of plagioclase feldspar. This mineral is commonly found in felsic magmas and is known for its ability to crystallize at high temperatures and pressures. As the magma cools and decompresses, plagioclase feldspar can crystallize, leading to the formation of a two-phase system. This can have significant implications for the overall composition and behavior of the magma.

#### Petrogenetic Processes in Felsic Magmas

The petrogenetic processes that occur in felsic magmas are also complex and involve a variety of factors. One of the key processes is the differentiation of the magma, which refers to the separation of different minerals and phases within the magma. This can occur through various mechanisms, including settling, filter pressing, and diffusion.

Another important petrogenetic process in felsic magmas is the assimilation of country rock. This refers to the incorporation of surrounding rocks into the magma, which can significantly alter its composition and behavior. Assimilation can occur through various mechanisms, including mixing and diffusion.

#### Implications for Igneous Petrology

The phase relations and petrogenetic processes in felsic magmas have significant implications for the field of igneous petrology. By studying these processes, we can gain a better understanding of the formation and evolution of felsic magmas, as well as their role in the overall geological processes. This knowledge can also be applied to the study of other types of magmas and their associated igneous rocks.

In addition, the study of phase relations and petrogenetic processes in felsic magmas can also have practical applications. For example, understanding the behavior of felsic magmas can help us predict volcanic activity and mitigate the risks associated with it. It can also aid in the exploration and extraction of valuable minerals and resources from igneous rocks.

In conclusion, the study of phase relations and petrogenetic processes in felsic magmas is crucial for advancing our understanding of igneous petrology. By delving into the complexities of these processes, we can gain valuable insights into the formation and evolution of felsic magmas and their associated igneous rocks.

### Subsection: 3.4a Characteristics and formation of large silicic magmatic systems

Large silicic magmatic systems are a significant component of igneous rock series. These systems are characterized by their high silica content and their ability to produce a variety of different types of igneous rocks. In this section, we will explore the characteristics and formation of large silicic magmatic systems.

#### The Characteristics of Large Silicic Magmatic Systems

Large silicic magmatic systems are typically composed of felsic magmas, which have a silica content greater than 63%. These magmas are known for their high viscosity, which can range from 10<sup>8</sup> cP (10<sup>5</sup> Pa⋅s) for hot rhyolite magma at <cvt|1200|C||> to 10<sup>11</sup> cP (10<sup>8</sup> Pa⋅s) for cool rhyolite magma at <cvt|800|C||>. This high viscosity is due to the high silica content of these magmas, which leads to a high melting point and a thick, paste-like consistency.

Large silicic magmatic systems are also known for their ability to produce a variety of different types of igneous rocks. This is due to the fact that these systems can undergo significant changes in composition and behavior as they cool and decompress. This allows them to play a key role in the differentiation of magmas and the formation of different types of igneous rocks.

#### The Formation of Large Silicic Magmatic Systems

Large silicic magmatic systems are typically formed through the crystallization of molten rock, or magma, at the surface of the Earth. This magma is often derived from the melting of the Earth's mantle, but can also be formed through the melting of other types of rocks, such as sedimentary or metamorphic rocks. As the magma rises towards the surface, it cools and decompresses, leading to the formation of different minerals.

The formation of large silicic magmatic systems is also influenced by the presence of water and other volatile elements. The introduction of water and other volatiles can lower the melting point of the magma, leading to a decrease in viscosity and an increase in the formation of different types of igneous rocks.

#### The Role of Large Silicic Magmatic Systems in Igneous Rock Series

Large silicic magmatic systems play a crucial role in the formation of igneous rock series. Their ability to undergo significant changes in composition and behavior as they cool and decompress allows them to play a key role in the differentiation of magmas and the formation of different types of igneous rocks.

Furthermore, the presence of large silicic magmatic systems can also influence the formation of other types of igneous rocks. For example, the assimilation of surrounding rocks by granites, a common type of large silicic magmatic system, can lead to the formation of different types of igneous rocks. This process can significantly alter the overall composition of the magma and can even lead to the formation of new types of igneous rocks.

In conclusion, large silicic magmatic systems are a crucial component of igneous rock series. Their high silica content, high viscosity, and ability to undergo significant changes in composition and behavior make them a key player in the formation of different types of igneous rocks. Their presence can also influence the formation of other types of igneous rocks, making them a vital component in the study of igneous petrology.





### Subsection: 3.4b Petrogenesis and magma evolution in large silicic magmatic systems

The petrogenesis of large silicic magmatic systems is a complex process that involves the evolution of magmas as they move through the Earth's crust and mantle. This process is influenced by a variety of factors, including the composition of the source rock, the temperature and pressure conditions, and the presence of volatiles.

#### The Role of the Source Rock

The composition of the source rock plays a crucial role in the petrogenesis of large silicic magmatic systems. The source rock can be a variety of different types, including the Earth's mantle, sedimentary rocks, or metamorphic rocks. Each of these types of rocks has a different composition, which can influence the melting behavior and the resulting magma.

For example, the mantle is composed of a variety of different types of rocks, including peridotite and eclogite. Peridotite is a mafic rock with a high iron and magnesium content, while eclogite is a more evolved ultramafic rock with a higher silica content. The melting behavior of these rocks can vary significantly, leading to the formation of different types of magmas.

Sedimentary rocks, on the other hand, are composed of a variety of different types of minerals and can have a high silica content. The melting behavior of these rocks can be influenced by the presence of volatiles, which can lower the melting point and lead to the formation of more evolved magmas.

Metamorphic rocks, such as gneiss, can also play a role in the petrogenesis of large silicic magmatic systems. These rocks can undergo partial melting, leading to the formation of magmas with a variety of different compositions.

#### The Influence of Temperature and Pressure Conditions

The temperature and pressure conditions that a magma experiences as it moves through the Earth's crust and mantle can also influence its petrogenesis. As a magma moves towards the surface, it cools and decompresses, leading to changes in its composition. This can result in the formation of different minerals and the evolution of the magma towards a more evolved composition.

The temperature and pressure conditions can also influence the crystallization behavior of the magma. For example, at high temperatures and pressures, minerals such as olivine and pyroxene can crystallize, while at lower temperatures and pressures, minerals such as plagioclase and quartz can crystallize. This can lead to changes in the mineralogy and composition of the magma as it moves towards the surface.

#### The Role of Volatiles

Volatiles, such as water and carbon dioxide, can also play a significant role in the petrogenesis of large silicic magmatic systems. These volatiles can lower the melting point of the source rock, leading to the formation of more evolved magmas. They can also influence the crystallization behavior of the magma, leading to the formation of different minerals.

In addition, volatiles can also be responsible for the formation of hydrothermal alteration assemblages, which can significantly alter the composition of the magma. This can result in the formation of new minerals and the precipitation of elements, leading to changes in the overall composition of the magma.

#### The Evolution of Magmas

The evolution of magmas in large silicic magmatic systems is a complex process that involves changes in composition, mineralogy, and texture. As a magma moves towards the surface, it can undergo changes in temperature and pressure, leading to changes in its composition. This can result in the formation of different minerals and the precipitation of elements, leading to changes in the overall composition of the magma.

In addition, the interaction of magmas with the surrounding rocks can also influence their evolution. For example, the assimilation of surrounding rocks can lead to changes in the composition of the magma, while the mixing of different magmas can result in the formation of hybrid magmas with unique compositions.

The evolution of magmas can also be influenced by the presence of volatiles, which can lower the melting point and lead to the formation of more evolved magmas. The crystallization of different minerals can also result in changes in the composition of the magma, leading to the formation of different types of igneous rocks.

In conclusion, the petrogenesis and magma evolution in large silicic magmatic systems is a complex process that involves the interaction of various factors, including the composition of the source rock, temperature and pressure conditions, and the presence of volatiles. This process can result in the formation of a variety of different types of igneous rocks, each with its own unique characteristics. 





### Subsection: 3.5a Geology and igneous activity in Hawaii

The Hawaiian Islands are a chain of volcanic islands formed by a hot spot in the Earth's mantle. The Hawaiian hot spot is responsible for the creation of the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, a series of volcanic structures that extends from the Hawaiian Islands to the Emperor Seamounts. The hot spot is located at a depth of about 100 km below the surface and has been active for at least 70 million years.

#### The Hawaiian Islands

The Hawaiian Islands are the result of the Hawaiian hot spot's activity. As the Pacific Plate moves over the hot spot, magma is generated and rises to the surface, creating new islands. The oldest islands in the chain, Kure and Midway, are located to the northwest of the main Hawaiian Islands. These islands are composed of oceanic crust and are not visible above sea level.

The main Hawaiian Islands, from oldest to youngest, are Hawaii, Kahoolawe, Maui, Lanai, Molokai, Oahu, and Kauai. These islands are all composed of shield volcanoes, which are large, low-angle volcanoes that are typically found on oceanic crust. The youngest island, Hawaii, is still actively volcanic, with lava flows from Kilauea volcano occasionally reaching the ocean.

#### The Hawaiian-Emperor Seamount Chain

The Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain extends from the Hawaiian Islands to the Emperor Seamounts, a chain of underwater volcanoes located north of Hawaii. The chain is composed of both oceanic and continental crust, with the oldest parts of the chain being composed of continental crust.

The oldest part of the chain, the Hawaiian Islands, is composed of oceanic crust. As the Pacific Plate moves over the hot spot, the oceanic crust is created and the oldest parts of the chain are subducted beneath the younger parts. This process is known as seafloor spreading and is responsible for the creation of the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain.

#### The Role of the Hawaiian Hot Spot

The Hawaiian hot spot plays a crucial role in the petrogenesis of the Hawaiian Islands and the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain. The hot spot is responsible for the generation of magma, which is then extruded at the surface to create new landforms. The composition of the magma is influenced by the hot spot's melting behavior, which is in turn influenced by the composition of the source rock and the temperature and pressure conditions.

The Hawaiian hot spot also plays a role in the evolution of the Hawaiian Islands. As the hot spot continues to generate magma, the islands continue to grow and evolve. The oldest islands, such as Kure and Midway, are composed of older, more evolved magmas, while the younger islands, such as Hawaii, are composed of younger, more primitive magmas.

In conclusion, the Hawaiian hot spot is a crucial component of the Hawaiian Islands and the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain. Its activity continues to shape the islands and the seamount chain, and its influence can be seen in the composition and evolution of the landforms.

## Chapter 4: Metamorphic Rocks

 4.1: Metamorphic Processes

Metamorphic rocks are formed when igneous or sedimentary rocks are subjected to high temperatures and pressures, causing them to change in mineral composition and texture. This process is known as metamorphism and it plays a crucial role in the evolution of the Earth's crust. In this section, we will explore the different types of metamorphic processes and their significance in the geological history of our planet.

#### Subsection 4.1a: Metamorphic Processes and Their Significance

Metamorphic processes are classified based on the type of original rock and the conditions under which it undergoes metamorphism. The three main types of metamorphic processes are contact metamorphism, regional metamorphism, and dynamic metamorphism.

Contact metamorphism occurs when a rock is heated by a nearby intrusion of magma. This process is responsible for the formation of high-grade metamorphic rocks, such as hornfels and gneiss. Contact metamorphism is significant because it can provide insights into the composition and temperature of the intruding magma.

Regional metamorphism, on the other hand, occurs when a large area of rock is subjected to high temperatures and pressures. This process is responsible for the formation of low-grade metamorphic rocks, such as slate and phyllite. Regional metamorphism is significant because it can provide information about the tectonic history of the Earth's crust.

Dynamic metamorphism is a type of metamorphism that occurs in the presence of fluid. This process is responsible for the formation of high-grade metamorphic rocks, such as eclogite and greenschist. Dynamic metamorphism is significant because it can provide insights into the composition and movement of fluids in the Earth's crust.

The significance of metamorphic processes goes beyond their role in the formation of new rocks. They also play a crucial role in the cycling of elements and minerals in the Earth's crust. For example, the metamorphism of sedimentary rocks can release valuable minerals and elements that can be used in various industries.

Furthermore, metamorphic processes can also provide insights into the history of the Earth's crust. By studying the mineral composition and texture of metamorphic rocks, scientists can determine the conditions under which they were formed and the tectonic events that may have influenced their formation.

In conclusion, metamorphic processes are essential in the study of igneous petrology. They not only play a crucial role in the formation of new rocks but also provide valuable insights into the history and evolution of the Earth's crust. In the next section, we will explore the different types of metamorphic rocks and their formation processes in more detail.

### Subsection 4.1b: Metamorphic Processes and Their Effects on Rock Composition

Metamorphic processes have a significant impact on the composition of rocks. As rocks undergo metamorphism, their mineral composition and texture can change dramatically. This is due to the high temperatures and pressures that these rocks are subjected to, which can cause minerals to recrystallize and form new minerals.

Contact metamorphism, for example, can result in the formation of high-grade metamorphic rocks with a different mineral composition than the original rock. This is because the intruding magma can introduce new minerals and elements, which can alter the mineral composition of the surrounding rock.

Regional metamorphism, on the other hand, can result in the formation of low-grade metamorphic rocks with a different texture than the original rock. This is because the high temperatures and pressures can cause the minerals in the rock to recrystallize and form new minerals with a different texture.

Dynamic metamorphism can also have a significant impact on rock composition. The presence of fluid can cause minerals to dissolve and recrystallize, resulting in the formation of new minerals with a different composition than the original rock.

Overall, metamorphic processes play a crucial role in the evolution of the Earth's crust. They can alter the mineral composition and texture of rocks, providing valuable insights into the tectonic history of our planet.

In this section, we will explore the different types of metamorphic processes and their significance in the geological history of our planet.

#### Subsection 4.1a: Metamorphic Processes and Their Significance

Metamorphic processes are classified based on the type of original rock and the conditions under which it undergoes metamorphism. The three main types of metamorphic processes are contact metamorphism, regional metamorphism, and dynamic metamorphism.

Contact metamorphism occurs when a rock is heated by a nearby intrusion of magma. This process is responsible for the formation of high-grade metamorphic rocks, such as hornfels and gneiss. Contact metamorphism is significant because it can provide insights into the composition and temperature of the intruding magma.

Regional metamorphism, on the other hand, occurs when a large area of rock is subjected to high temperatures and pressures. This process is responsible for the formation of low-grade metamorphic rocks, such as slate and phyllite. Regional metamorphism is significant because it can provide information about the tectonic history of the Earth's crust.

Dynamic metamorphism is a type of metamorphism that occurs in the presence of fluid. This process is responsible for the formation of high-grade metamorphic rocks, such as eclogite and greenschist. Dynamic metamorphism is significant because it can provide insights into the composition and movement of fluids in the Earth's crust.

The significance of metamorphic processes goes beyond their role in the formation of new rocks. They also play a crucial role in the cycling of elements and minerals in the Earth's crust. For example, the metamorphism of sedimentary rocks can release valuable minerals and elements that can be used in various industries. Additionally, metamorphic processes can also provide insights into the tectonic history of the Earth's crust, as different types of metamorphism can occur in different geological settings.

#### Subsection 4.1b: Metamorphic Processes and Their Effects on Rock Composition

Metamorphic processes can have a significant impact on the composition of rocks. As rocks undergo metamorphism, their mineral composition can change due to the high temperatures and pressures they are subjected to. This can result in the formation of new minerals and the redistribution of elements within the rock.

Contact metamorphism, for example, can result in the formation of high-grade metamorphic rocks with a different mineral composition than the original rock. This is because the intruding magma can introduce new minerals and elements, altering the composition of the surrounding rock.

Regional metamorphism, on the other hand, can result in the formation of low-grade metamorphic rocks with a different mineral composition than the original rock. This is because the high temperatures and pressures can cause the minerals in the rock to recrystallize, resulting in a change in mineral composition.

Dynamic metamorphism can also have a significant impact on rock composition. The presence of fluid can cause minerals to dissolve and recrystallize, resulting in the formation of new minerals with a different composition than the original rock.

Overall, metamorphic processes play a crucial role in the evolution of the Earth's crust and can provide valuable insights into the tectonic history of our planet. By studying the effects of these processes on rock composition, we can gain a better understanding of the complex processes that shape our planet.

### Subsection: 3.6a Introduction to Continental Flood Basalts (CFBs)

Continental Flood Basalts (CFBs) are a type of igneous rock that is formed through large-scale volcanic eruptions. These eruptions are typically associated with the formation of large, flat-lying lava flows that cover large areas of the Earth's surface. CFBs are found on all continents, but are most commonly associated with the mid-Miocene transition in the Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG).

#### The Columbia River Basalt Group

The Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG) is a large igneous province (LIP) located in the northwestern United States. It is composed of more than 300 individual basalt lava flows that have an average volume of . The CRBG is divided into four major categories: The Steens Basalt, Grande Ronde Basalt, the Wanapum Basalt, and the Saddle Mountains Basalt. The various lava flows have been dated by radiometric dating—particularly through measurement of the ratios of isotopes of potassium to argon.

The transition to flood volcanism in the CRBG, similar to other large igneous provinces, was also marked by atmospheric loading through the mass exsolution and emission of volatiles, via the process of volcanic degassing. Comparative analysis of volatile concentrations in source feeder dikes to associated extruded flow units have been quantitatively measured to determine the magnitude of degassing exhibited in CRBG eruptions. Of the more than 300 individual flows associated with the CRBG, the Roza flow contains some of the most well chemically preserved basalts for volatile analysis. Contained within the Wanapum formation, Roza is one of the most extensive members of the CRBG with an area of 40,300 square kilometres and a volume of 1,300 cubic kilometres. With magmatic volatile values assumed at 1 - 1.5 percent by weight concentration for source feeder dikes, the emission of sulphur for the Roza flow is calculated to be on the order of 12Gt (12,000 million tonnes) at a rate of 1.2Gt (1,200 million tonnes) annually, in the form of sulphur dioxide. However, other research through petrologic analysis has yielded SO2 mass degassing values at 0.12% - 0.28% of the total erupted mass of the magma, translating to lower emission estimates in the range of 0.2 - 0.6 Gt/yr.

#### The Role of CFBs in the Earth's Evolution

CFBs play a significant role in the Earth's evolution, particularly in the mid-Miocene transition. The large-scale volcanic eruptions associated with CFBs release large amounts of volatiles into the atmosphere, which can have a significant impact on the Earth's climate and atmosphere. The release of these volatiles can also lead to changes in the Earth's magnetic field, as seen in the Selli Event.

Furthermore, the formation of CFBs can also have a significant impact on the Earth's surface. The large, flat-lying lava flows associated with CFBs can cover large areas of the Earth's surface, altering the topography and creating new landforms. This can have implications for the distribution of life on Earth, as well as the movement of tectonic plates.

In conclusion, CFBs are a crucial component of the Earth's evolution, playing a significant role in shaping the Earth's surface, atmosphere, and climate. Further research into the formation and impact of CFBs will continue to enhance our understanding of the Earth's past and future.

### Subsection: 3.6b Petrologic and geochemical characteristics of CFBs

Continental Flood Basalts (CFBs) are characterized by their large-scale, flat-lying lava flows that cover extensive areas of the Earth's surface. These basalts are typically formed through large-scale volcanic eruptions, and their petrologic and geochemical characteristics provide valuable insights into the processes of their formation and the evolution of the Earth's mantle.

#### Petrologic Characteristics of CFBs

The petrologic characteristics of CFBs are largely determined by their mineral composition. The most common minerals found in CFBs are plagioclase feldspar, pyroxene, and olivine. These minerals are typically found in varying proportions, depending on the specific CFB and the conditions under which it was formed.

The mineral composition of CFBs can be used to infer the conditions under which they were formed. For example, the presence of olivine suggests that the magma was formed at high temperatures and pressures, while the presence of plagioclase feldspar suggests that the magma was formed at lower temperatures and pressures.

#### Geochemical Characteristics of CFBs

The geochemical characteristics of CFBs are largely determined by their chemical composition. The most common elements found in CFBs are iron, magnesium, calcium, and silicon. These elements are typically found in varying proportions, depending on the specific CFB and the conditions under which it was formed.

The chemical composition of CFBs can be used to infer the composition of the mantle from which they were derived. For example, the presence of high iron and magnesium contents suggests that the mantle was enriched in these elements, while the presence of low iron and magnesium contents suggests that the mantle was depleted in these elements.

#### The Significance of CFBs

The petrologic and geochemical characteristics of CFBs have significant implications for our understanding of the Earth's mantle. The large-scale, flat-lying lava flows of CFBs suggest that the mantle is capable of generating large volumes of magma, and that this magma can be efficiently transported to the surface.

The mineral and chemical composition of CFBs provides valuable insights into the processes of mantle convection and the evolution of the Earth's mantle. For example, the presence of olivine suggests that the mantle is capable of generating high temperatures and pressures, while the presence of plagioclase feldspar suggests that the mantle is capable of generating lower temperatures and pressures.

In addition, the geochemical characteristics of CFBs can be used to trace the movement of the Earth's plates. For example, the presence of high iron and magnesium contents in CFBs can be used to trace the movement of the Pacific Plate, while the presence of low iron and magnesium contents can be used to trace the movement of the North American Plate.

In conclusion, the petrologic and geochemical characteristics of CFBs provide valuable insights into the processes of mantle convection and the evolution of the Earth's mantle. These insights are crucial for our understanding of the Earth's mantle and its role in the dynamics of the Earth's surface.

## Chapter 4: The Role of Igneous Processes in Orogenic Systems

### Introduction

The study of igneous processes is a crucial aspect of geology, particularly in the context of orogenic systems. Orogenic systems, or mountain-building processes, are fundamental to the evolution of the Earth's crust and the formation of its diverse landscapes. This chapter will delve into the role of igneous processes in these systems, exploring how they contribute to the formation of mountains and other geological features.

Igneous processes are responsible for the creation of many of the Earth's most striking geological features. They are involved in the formation of volcanic mountains, such as the Andes and the Himalayas, as well as in the creation of intrusive igneous complexes, such as the Skaergaard intrusion in Greenland. These processes are also integral to the formation of granitic gneiss, a common type of metamorphic rock found in many mountain ranges.

In this chapter, we will explore the various types of igneous processes that contribute to orogenic systems. These include volcanic processes, such as lava flow and explosive volcanism, as well as intrusive processes, such as plutonism and sill emplacement. We will also discuss the role of these processes in the formation of different types of igneous rocks, and how these rocks can be used to understand the history of orogenic systems.

Finally, we will examine the interplay between igneous processes and other geological processes, such as metamorphism and faulting, in the context of orogenic systems. This will provide a comprehensive understanding of how these processes work together to shape the Earth's crust and create the diverse landscapes we see today.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the role of igneous processes in orogenic systems, and be able to apply this knowledge to the study of various geological features and processes. This chapter will serve as a foundation for further exploration into the fascinating world of igneous petrology.




### Subsection: 3.7a Phase equilibria and mantle sources of CFBs

The phase equilibria of the mantle sources of Continental Flood Basalts (CFBs) play a crucial role in understanding the formation and evolution of these igneous rocks. The phase equilibria of a system describe the conditions under which different phases of a substance can coexist in equilibrium. In the context of CFBs, the phase equilibria of the mantle sources can provide insights into the conditions under which the magma was formed and the processes that led to the formation of CFBs.

#### Phase Equilibria of the Mantle Sources of CFBs

The mantle sources of CFBs are typically composed of olivine, pyroxene, and feldspar. These minerals are stable at different temperatures and pressures, and their relative proportions in the mantle source can be inferred from the phase equilibria of the system.

At high temperatures and pressures, olivine is the stable phase. As the temperature decreases or the pressure increases, olivine transforms into pyroxene. Finally, at lower temperatures and pressures, pyroxene transforms into feldspar. This sequence of phase transformations can be represented by the following equation:

$$
\text{Olivine} \leftrightarrow \text{Pyroxene} \leftrightarrow \text{Feldspar}
$$

The phase equilibria of this system can be represented on a phase diagram, where the temperature and pressure are plotted against the composition of the system. The phase diagram can provide insights into the conditions under which each phase is stable, and the conditions under which the system can be in equilibrium.

#### Implications of Phase Equilibria for CFB Formation

The phase equilibria of the mantle sources of CFBs have significant implications for the formation of these igneous rocks. The phase equilibria can provide insights into the temperature and pressure conditions under which the magma was formed. For example, if the phase equilibria indicate that the mantle source was at high temperatures and pressures, this suggests that the magma was formed through a process of mantle melting.

Furthermore, the phase equilibria can also provide insights into the composition of the mantle source. For example, if the phase equilibria indicate that the mantle source was enriched in olivine, this suggests that the mantle source was enriched in iron and magnesium. Conversely, if the phase equilibria indicate that the mantle source was enriched in feldspar, this suggests that the mantle source was enriched in calcium and silicon.

In conclusion, the phase equilibria of the mantle sources of CFBs play a crucial role in understanding the formation and evolution of these igneous rocks. By studying the phase equilibria, we can gain insights into the conditions under which the magma was formed and the processes that led to the formation of CFBs.




### Subsection: 3.7b Constraints on CFB mantle sources using petrologic and geochemical data

The petrologic and geochemical data of Continental Flood Basalts (CFBs) can provide valuable insights into the nature of their mantle sources. These data can be used to constrain the composition and evolution of the mantle sources, and to understand the processes that led to the formation of CFBs.

#### Petrologic Data

The petrologic data of CFBs can be used to infer the composition of their mantle sources. The mineral assemblage of CFBs, for example, can provide insights into the temperature and pressure conditions under which the magma was formed. As discussed in the previous section, the phase equilibria of the mantle sources can be represented on a phase diagram, where the temperature and pressure are plotted against the composition of the system. The phase diagram can provide insights into the conditions under which each phase is stable, and the conditions under which the system can be in equilibrium.

#### Geochemical Data

The geochemical data of CFBs can be used to infer the evolution of their mantle sources. The geochemical composition of CFBs can change over time due to processes such as fractional melting and differentiation. Fractional melting occurs when a magma is melted in stages, with different minerals melting at different temperatures. This process can result in the separation of different minerals, each with its own geochemical composition. Differentiation, on the other hand, occurs when a magma separates into layers of different densities. This process can result in the stratification of the magma, with different layers having different geochemical compositions.

#### Implications of Petrologic and Geochemical Data for CFB Formation

The petrologic and geochemical data of CFBs can provide valuable insights into the formation of these igneous rocks. The data can be used to infer the composition and evolution of the mantle sources, and to understand the processes that led to the formation of CFBs. For example, the petrologic and geochemical data can be used to infer the temperature and pressure conditions under which the magma was formed, and the processes that led to the formation of different minerals. The data can also be used to infer the evolution of the mantle sources, and the processes that led to the formation of different layers within the magma.




### Subsection: 3.8a Geology and petrogenesis of Bushveld, Stillwater, and Skaergaard intrusions

The Bushveld, Stillwater, and Skaergaard intrusions are three of the most significant layered igneous complexes in the world. They are known for their unique geological and petrological characteristics, as well as their economic importance due to the presence of valuable mineral deposits.

#### Bushveld Igneous Complex

The Bushveld Igneous Complex, located in South Africa, is one of the largest layered intrusions in the world. It is divided into an eastern and western lobe, with a further northern extension. The complex was formed about 2 billion years ago, and it is thought to predate the nearby Vredefort impact by some 30 million years.

The formation of the Bushveld Complex is associated with the injection of molten rock from Earth's mantle through long vertical cracks in the Earth's crust. This resulted in the formation of a structure similar to a layered cake, with distinct rock strata. The complex includes three PGM-bearing layers, referred to as reefs, which are of particular interest due to their economic importance.

The extrusions were emplaced over an early diabasic sill, outcrops of which are visible on the southeastern side of the Complex. These are typically greenish in colour and composed of clinopyroxene, altered to hornblende and plagioclase, and are regarded as the earliest phase of the Complex.

The Bushveld Complex varies in thickness, reaching up to 10 km in places. Lithologies vary from largely ultramafic peridotite, chromitite, harzburgite, and bronzitite in the lower sections to mafic norite, anorthosite, and gabbro toward the top. The complex also includes the felsic Rustenburg Layered Suite and the Lebowa Granite Suite.

#### Stillwater Igneous Complex

The Stillwater Igneous Complex, located in Montana, USA, is another significant layered intrusion. It is known for its economic importance due to the presence of valuable mineral deposits, including platinum, palladium, and copper.

The formation of the Stillwater Complex is associated with the emplacement of a series of mafic to felsic intrusive igneous rocks. These rocks are thought to have been derived from the melting of the mantle and the surrounding crust, and they are characterized by their layered structure.

#### Skaergaard Intrusion

The Skaergaard Intrusion, located in Greenland, is a layered igneous complex that is known for its unique petrological characteristics. It is composed of a series of layered mafic to felsic intrusive igneous rocks, which are thought to have been derived from the melting of the mantle and the surrounding crust.

The Skaergaard Intrusion is particularly interesting due to its layered structure, which is thought to reflect the differentiation of a magma chamber. The lower layers of the intrusion are composed of mafic rocks, while the upper layers are composed of felsic rocks. This layered structure provides valuable insights into the processes that occur during the formation of igneous rocks.

In conclusion, the Bushveld, Stillwater, and Skaergaard intrusions are three of the most significant layered igneous complexes in the world. They are known for their unique geological and petrological characteristics, as well as their economic importance. The study of these complexes provides valuable insights into the processes that occur during the formation of igneous rocks, and they are of great importance to the field of igneous petrology.




### Subsection: 3.8b Petrologic and geochemical features of these large layered intrusions

The Bushveld, Stillwater, and Skaergaard intrusions are not only significant for their size and economic importance, but also for their unique petrologic and geochemical features. These features provide valuable insights into the processes that formed these intrusions and the evolution of the Earth's mantle.

#### Bushveld Igneous Complex

The Bushveld Complex is characterized by a complex layering of different rock types, including ultramafic and mafic rocks. The lower sections of the complex are dominated by ultramafic rocks such as peridotite, chromitite, harzburgite, and bronzitite. These rocks are rich in iron and magnesium, and are thought to represent the earliest stages of the complex's formation.

As one moves upwards in the complex, the rock types become progressively more mafic, with the presence of norite, anorthosite, and gabbro. These rocks are richer in silicon and calcium, and are thought to represent later stages of the complex's formation. The complex also includes the felsic Rustenburg Layered Suite and the Lebowa Granite Suite, which are thought to represent the final stages of the complex's formation.

The Bushveld Complex is also characterized by its high platinum group metal (PGM) content. The PGM-bearing layers, or reefs, are of particular interest due to their economic importance. These reefs are thought to have formed as a result of the separation of different minerals during the complex's formation, with the PGM-rich minerals settling to the bottom of the intrusion.

#### Stillwater Igneous Complex

The Stillwater Complex, like the Bushveld Complex, is characterized by a complex layering of different rock types. The lower sections of the complex are dominated by ultramafic rocks such as peridotite and harzburgite. These rocks are thought to represent the earliest stages of the complex's formation.

As one moves upwards in the complex, the rock types become progressively more mafic, with the presence of norite, anorthosite, and gabbro. These rocks are thought to represent later stages of the complex's formation. The complex also includes the felsic Rustenburg Layered Suite and the Lebowa Granite Suite, which are thought to represent the final stages of the complex's formation.

The Stillwater Complex is also characterized by its high PGM content. The PGM-bearing layers, or reefs, are of particular interest due to their economic importance. These reefs are thought to have formed as a result of the separation of different minerals during the complex's formation, with the PGM-rich minerals settling to the bottom of the intrusion.

#### Skaergaard Intrusion

The Skaergaard Intrusion, located in Greenland, is characterized by a layering of different rock types, including ultramafic and mafic rocks. The lower sections of the intrusion are dominated by ultramafic rocks such as peridotite and harzburgite. These rocks are thought to represent the earliest stages of the intrusion's formation.

As one moves upwards in the intrusion, the rock types become progressively more mafic, with the presence of norite, anorthosite, and gabbro. These rocks are thought to represent later stages of the intrusion's formation. The intrusion also includes the felsic Rustenburg Layered Suite and the Lebowa Granite Suite, which are thought to represent the final stages of the intrusion's formation.

The Skaergaard Intrusion is also characterized by its high PGM content. The PGM-bearing layers, or reefs, are of particular interest due to their economic importance. These reefs are thought to have formed as a result of the separation of different minerals during the intrusion's formation, with the PGM-rich minerals settling to the bottom of the intrusion.




### Subsection: 3.9a Occurrence and petrogenesis of anorthosites

Anorthosites are a unique type of igneous rock that are of great interest to geologists due to their composition and formation. They are characterized by their high plagioclase feldspar content, with a minimal mafic component. This composition is not common in other types of igneous rocks, and it is still not fully understood how anorthosites form.

#### Occurrence of Anorthosites

Anorthosites can be found on Earth in five main types, with the first two being the most common. These two types have different modes of occurrence and are thought to have had different origins. Anorthosites are also found on the Moon, where they constitute the light-colored areas of the lunar surface.

On Earth, anorthosites typically occur as extensive stocks or batholiths. The areal extent of anorthosite batholiths can range from relatively small (dozens or hundreds of square kilometers) to nearly 100,000 square kilometers, as seen in the Nain Plutonic Suite or Mistastin crater in northern Labrador, Canada.

Major occurrences of anorthosite are found in the southeast U.S., the Appalachian Mountains, eastern Canada, across southern Scandinavia and eastern Europe, and in the Skaergaard intrusion in Greenland. Mapped onto the Pangaean continental configuration of that eon, these occurrences are all contained in a single straight belt, and must all have been emplaced intracratonally.

#### Petrogenesis of Anorthosites

The formation of anorthosites is still not fully understood, but most models involve the separation of plagioclase crystals based on their density. As plagioclase crystallizes in a magma chamber, the plagioclase crystals float to the top, concentrating there. This process is known as fractional crystallization.

However, the exact mechanisms and conditions that lead to the formation of anorthosites are still being researched. It is thought that the composition of the magma, the temperature and pressure conditions, and the presence of other minerals can all play a role in the formation of anorthosites.

In conclusion, anorthosites are a unique and fascinating type of igneous rock that have been the subject of much research. Their high plagioclase feldspar content and unusual mode of occurrence make them a valuable case study for understanding the processes that form igneous rocks. Further research and advancements in technology will continue to shed light on the significance of anorthosites in the field of igneous petrology.


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the significance of igneous rock series in understanding the evolution of the Earth's crust.

### Subsection: 3.9b Petrologic and geochemical characteristics of anorthosites

Anorthosites are characterized by their high plagioclase feldspar content, with a minimal mafic component. This composition is not common in other types of igneous rocks, and it is still not fully understood how anorthosites form. In this section, we will explore the petrologic and geochemical characteristics of anorthosites, including their chemical and isotopic characteristics.

#### Chemical and Isotopic Characteristics of Anorthosites

Anorthosites are typically >90% plagioclase, and the plagioclase composition is commonly between An<sub>40</sub> and An<sub>60</sub> (40–60% anorthite). This compositional range is intermediate, and is one of the characteristics which distinguish Proterozoic anorthosites from Archean anorthosites (which are typically >An<sub>80</sub>).

Proterozoic anorthosites often have significant mafic components in addition to plagioclase. These phases can include olivine, pyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides, and/or apatite. Mafic minerals in Proterozoic anorthosites have a wide range of composition, but are not generally highly magnesian.

The trace-element chemistry of Proterozoic anorthosites, and the associated rock types, has been examined in some detail by researchers with the aim of arriving at a plausible genetic theory. However, there is still little agreement on just what the results mean for anorthosite genesis; see the 'Origins' section below. A very short list of results, including results for rocks thought to be related to Proterozoic anorthosites,<Clarify|date=September 2013>

Some research has focused on neodymium (Nd) and strontium (Sr) isotopic determinations for anorthosites, particularly for anorthosites of the Nain Plutonic Suite (NPS). Such isotopic determinations are of use in gauging the viability of prospective sources for magmas that gave rise to anorthosites. Some results are detailed below in the 'Origins' section.

#### High-Alumina Orthopyroxene Megacrysts (HAOMs)

Many Proterozoic-age anorthosites contain large crystals of orthopyroxene with distinctive compositions. These are the so-called high-alumina orthopyroxene megacrysts (HAOM).

HAOM are distinctive because 1) they contain higher amounts of Al than typically seen in orthopyroxenes; 2) they are cut by numerous thin lathes of plagioclase, which may represent exsolution lamellae; and 3) they appear to be older than the anorthosites in which they occur. This suggests that HAOM may have crystallized from a separate magma source, and their presence in anorthosites adds complexity to the already intriguing story of anorthosite genesis.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the origins of anorthosites, exploring the various theories and models that have been proposed to explain their formation.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the significance of igneous rock series, exploring their formation, characteristics, and the role they play in the broader context of geology.

We have also learned about the importance of understanding these rock series in order to interpret the geological history of a region. By studying the composition and structure of these rocks, we can gain insights into the conditions under which they were formed, and the processes that shaped them. 

Furthermore, we have discussed the role of igneous rock series in the formation of other geological features, such as volcanic structures and mineral deposits. This understanding is crucial for mineral exploration and resource development.

## Chapter 4: The Role of Igneous Processes in Ore Formation

### Introduction

The formation of ore is a complex process that involves a series of geological events. Among these, igneous processes play a crucial role. This chapter, "The Role of Igneous Processes in Ore Formation," delves into the intricate relationship between igneous processes and ore formation. 

Igneous processes are fundamental to the formation of many types of ore. These processes involve the crystallization of minerals from molten rock, or magma, which can result in the formation of ore deposits. The composition of the magma, as well as the conditions under which it crystallizes, can greatly influence the type and quality of ore that forms.

In this chapter, we will explore the various igneous processes involved in ore formation, including magma formation, differentiation, and crystallization. We will also discuss the role of these processes in the formation of different types of ore, such as copper, gold, and iron ore. 

Furthermore, we will examine the factors that influence the distribution and concentration of ore elements in igneous rocks. These factors include the composition of the magma, the temperature and pressure conditions during crystallization, and the presence of certain elements or compounds that can enhance ore formation.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of the role of igneous processes in ore formation, and be able to apply this knowledge to interpret the formation of ore deposits in various geological settings. This chapter will provide a foundation for further exploration into the fascinating world of igneous petrology and ore genesis.




### Subsection: 3.10a Geology and igneous activity in lunar highland and maria regions

The Moon's surface is divided into two main regions: the highlands and the maria. The highlands, also known as terrae, are the older and higher regions of the Moon's surface, while the maria, or "seas," are the younger and lower regions. These regions have distinct geological and igneous characteristics that provide valuable insights into the Moon's history and evolution.

#### Geology of the Lunar Highlands

The lunar highlands are primarily composed of mafic plutonic rocks and regolith breccias. These rocks are dominantly ferroan anorthosites, which are characterized by their high plagioclase feldspar content. The ferroan anorthosites are further divided into the ferroan anorthosite suite, the magnesian suite, and the alkali suite.

The ferroan anorthosite suite is the most common type of anorthosite in the highlands. It is characterized by its high iron content, with an average FeO content of 18–21%. The magnesian suite, on the other hand, has a lower iron content, with an average FeO content of 14–16%. The alkali suite is the least common type of anorthosite, with an average FeO content of 12–14%.

#### Igneous Activity in the Lunar Highlands

The highlands of the Moon are believed to have formed through a series of igneous processes. The most likely scenario is that the Moon's mantle was differentiated into a ferroan and magnesian layer, which then rose to the surface and formed the highlands. This process is supported by the chemical and isotopic characteristics of the highland rocks.

The highlands also exhibit evidence of impact melting, which is thought to have occurred during the formation of the Moon's large impact basins. This melting resulted in the formation of breccias, which are dominantly composed of highland lithologies. These breccias provide valuable insights into the composition and evolution of the highlands.

#### Geology of the Lunar Marias

The maria, or "seas," of the Moon are primarily composed of mare basalts. These basalts are named as such because they frequently constitute large portions of the lunar maria. They are typically characterized by their high iron content, with an average FeO content of 18–21%.

The mare basalts are also known for their high titanium content, with some basalts containing up to 13% TiO<sub>2</sub>. This high titanium content is thought to be due to the presence of ilmenite, a titanium-rich mineral, in the basalts.

#### Igneous Activity in the Lunar Marias

The maria of the Moon are believed to have formed through a series of volcanic processes. The most likely scenario is that the Moon's mantle was differentiated into a ferroan and magnesian layer, which then rose to the surface and formed the maria. This process is supported by the chemical and isotopic characteristics of the maria rocks.

The maria also exhibit evidence of impact melting, which is thought to have occurred during the formation of the Moon's large impact basins. This melting resulted in the formation of basaltic lavas, which are dominantly composed of mare basalts. These lavas provide valuable insights into the composition and evolution of the maria.

In conclusion, the geology and igneous activity of the lunar highlands and maria regions provide valuable insights into the Moon's history and evolution. The distinct characteristics of these regions highlight the complex processes that have shaped the Moon's surface over billions of years.




### Subsection: 3.10b Petrologic and geochemical features of lunar igneous rocks

The petrologic and geochemical features of lunar igneous rocks provide valuable insights into the Moon's history and evolution. These rocks are primarily composed of olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase feldspar, with some rocks also containing ilmenite and a new mineral named armalcolite.

#### Petrologic Features of Lunar Igneous Rocks

The petrologic features of lunar igneous rocks are largely similar to those found on Earth, with the main difference being the higher abundance of iron and magnesium in lunar rocks. This is particularly evident in the basaltic rocks of the maria, which contain higher abundances of olivine and pyroxene compared to the anorthositic rocks of the highlands.

The basaltic rocks of the maria are also richer in iron than terrestrial basalts, and have lower viscosities. This is due to the higher iron content, which lowers the melting point of the rocks and allows them to flow more easily. The lower viscosity also allows these rocks to spread out and form the large, flat plains that characterize the maria.

#### Geochemical Features of Lunar Igneous Rocks

The geochemical features of lunar igneous rocks are also unique and provide valuable insights into the Moon's history. The maria, for example, are composed predominantly of basalt, which is rich in iron and magnesium. This is in contrast to the highlands, which are composed primarily of anorthosite, a rock composed primarily of calcium-rich plagioclase feldspar.

The composition of the maria also varies significantly, with some regions containing higher abundances of olivine and pyroxene, while others contain more plagioclase. This variation is thought to be due to the different sources of magma that formed the maria, as well as the influence of the Moon's early atmosphere.

#### The Role of KREEP in Lunar Igneous Rocks

The KREEP (potassium, rare-earth elements, and phosphorus) component is also a significant component of the lunar crust. It is thought to be related to the petrogenesis of KREEP, and is found in the igneous "Mg-suite" rocks, such as the troctolites, norites, and KREEP-basalts.

The KREEP component is particularly important in understanding the formation of the Moon's highlands. It is thought to have been derived from the Moon's early atmosphere, which was rich in potassium and other rare-earth elements. This component is also thought to have played a role in the formation of the Moon's large impact basins, as it is found in the breccias that make up the regolith of these basins.

In conclusion, the petrologic and geochemical features of lunar igneous rocks provide valuable insights into the Moon's history and evolution. The unique composition and characteristics of these rocks continue to be a topic of research and study, as scientists strive to unravel the mysteries of the Moon's early history.

### Subsection: 3.11a Classification and petrogenesis of Howardites, Eucrites, and Diogenites

The Howardites, Eucrites, and Diogenites (HED) are a group of primitive achondrite meteorites that have been extensively studied due to their unique composition and petrologic features. These meteorites are believed to originate from the Moon, and their study has provided valuable insights into the early history of our solar system.

#### Classification of HED Meteorites

The HED meteorites are classified based on their mineral composition and texture. Howardites are fine-grained, basaltic rocks that are rich in iron and magnesium. Eucrites, on the other hand, are coarse-grained, plagioclase-rich rocks that are less iron-rich than basaltic rocks. Diogenites are intermediate in composition between howardites and eucrites, and are characterized by their high iron and magnesium content.

The classification of HED meteorites is important as it helps us understand the processes that formed these rocks. The differences in mineral composition and texture suggest that these rocks were formed under different conditions, and their study can provide insights into the early history of the Moon.

#### Petrogenesis of HED Meteorites

The petrogenesis of HED meteorites is a topic of ongoing research. The current understanding is that these rocks were formed by the melting of the Moon's early crust, which was composed of anorthosite. This melting was likely caused by impacts from asteroids and comets, which were common in the early solar system.

The melting of the Moon's early crust resulted in the formation of magma, which then differentiated into different types of rocks based on their mineral composition and texture. The basaltic rocks, such as howardites and eucrites, were formed from the melting of the lower crust, while the plagioclase-rich rocks, such as diogenites, were formed from the melting of the upper crust.

#### The Role of KREEP in HED Meteorites

The KREEP (potassium, rare-earth elements, and phosphorus) component is also a significant component of HED meteorites. It is believed to originate from the Moon's early mantle, and its presence in HED meteorites suggests that these rocks were formed from the melting of the Moon's early mantle.

The KREEP component is particularly important in the petrogenesis of HED meteorites as it provides insights into the early history of the Moon. Its presence suggests that the Moon's early mantle was rich in potassium, rare-earth elements, and phosphorus, which can be used to reconstruct the early conditions on the Moon.

In conclusion, the study of HED meteorites, particularly their classification and petrogenesis, is crucial in understanding the early history of the Moon and the solar system. The unique composition and petrologic features of these meteorites continue to be a topic of ongoing research, and their study will continue to provide valuable insights into the early history of our solar system.

These meteorites are believed to originate from the Moon, and their study has led to significant advancements in our understanding of the Moon's early history.

#### Petrologic Characteristics of HED Meteorites

The petrologic characteristics of HED meteorites are largely determined by their mineral composition and texture. As mentioned earlier, Howardites are fine-grained, basaltic rocks that are rich in iron and magnesium. Eucrites, on the other hand, are coarse-grained, plagioclase-rich rocks that are less iron-rich than basaltic rocks. Diogenites are intermediate in composition between howardites and eucrites, and are characterized by their high iron and magnesium content.

The petrologic characteristics of HED meteorites are also influenced by their formation processes. The melting of the Moon's early crust resulted in the formation of magma, which then differentiated into different types of rocks based on their mineral composition and texture. This differentiation process is believed to have occurred in the Moon's early history, and the study of HED meteorites has provided valuable insights into this process.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the topic of meteorite petrology, specifically focusing on the SNC meteorites. These meteorites, named after their respective locations of discovery (Shergotty, Nakhla, and Chassigny), are a group of primitive achondrites that have been extensively studied in the field of igneous petrology. They are believed to originate from the early history of the solar system, and their study has provided valuable insights into the formation and evolution of the Earth and other planetary bodies.

The SNC meteorites are unique in their composition and structure, making them a fascinating subject for advanced study in igneous petrology. They are characterized by their high iron and magnesium content, as well as their low silicon and aluminum content. This composition is thought to be a result of their formation in a reducing atmosphere, where the presence of oxygen was limited. This has led to the development of unique mineral assemblages and textures that are not found in other types of meteorites.

In this chapter, we will explore the petrologic and geochemical characteristics of the SNC meteorites, as well as their significance in the field of igneous petrology. We will also discuss the various theories and models proposed for their formation and evolution, and how these have been tested through laboratory experiments and observations. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of the SNC meteorites and their role in our understanding of the early solar system.

 4.1: Petrologic and Geochemical Characteristics of the SNC Meteorites

The SNC meteorites, named after their respective locations of discovery (Shergotty, Nakhla, and Chassigny), are a group of primitive achondrites that have been extensively studied in the field of igneous petrology. These meteorites are believed to originate from the early history of the solar system, and their study has provided valuable insights into the formation and evolution of the Earth and other planetary bodies.

The SNC meteorites are characterized by their high iron and magnesium content, as well as their low silicon and aluminum content. This composition is thought to be a result of their formation in a reducing atmosphere, where the presence of oxygen was limited. This has led to the development of unique mineral assemblages and textures that are not found in other types of meteorites.

### Subsection 4.1a: Classification and Petrogenesis of the SNC Meteorites

The SNC meteorites are classified as primitive achondrites, meaning they are differentiated rocks that have undergone minimal melting and differentiation. This is in contrast to other types of meteorites, such as chondrites, which are undifferentiated and have undergone minimal heating and melting. The SNC meteorites are also unique in their composition, as they have a high iron and magnesium content, with low silicon and aluminum content.

The petrogenesis, or formation, of the SNC meteorites is still a topic of debate among researchers. One theory proposes that they were formed through the melting of a chondritic precursor, which was then differentiated through the separation of minerals based on their density. This theory is supported by the presence of chondritic inclusions within the SNC meteorites.

Another theory suggests that the SNC meteorites were formed through the melting of a basaltic precursor, which was then differentiated through the separation of minerals based on their chemical affinity. This theory is supported by the presence of basaltic minerals, such as olivine and pyroxene, within the SNC meteorites.

Regardless of their exact formation process, the SNC meteorites are believed to have formed in a reducing atmosphere, where the presence of oxygen was limited. This has led to the development of unique mineral assemblages and textures that are not found in other types of meteorites.

In the next section, we will explore the various theories and models proposed for the formation and evolution of the SNC meteorites, and how these have been tested through laboratory experiments and observations. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of the SNC meteorites and their role in our understanding of the early solar system.

### Subsection 4.1b: Mineral Composition and Texture of the SNC Meteorites

The SNC meteorites are known for their unique mineral composition and texture, which is a result of their formation in a reducing atmosphere. The dominant minerals found in the SNC meteorites are olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase feldspar. These minerals are commonly found in basaltic rocks, but their presence in the SNC meteorites is significant due to their high iron and magnesium content.

The texture of the SNC meteorites is also distinct, with a fine-grained, equigranular appearance. This is in contrast to the coarse-grained texture found in other types of meteorites. The fine-grained texture of the SNC meteorites is thought to be a result of their formation through the differentiation of a molten precursor.

### Subsection 4.1c: Geochemical Characteristics of the SNC Meteorites

The geochemical characteristics of the SNC meteorites are also unique and provide valuable insights into the early history of the solar system. The SNC meteorites have a high iron and magnesium content, with low silicon and aluminum content. This composition is thought to be a result of their formation in a reducing atmosphere, where the presence of oxygen was limited.

The SNC meteorites also have a high concentration of volatile elements, such as water and carbon dioxide, which is thought to be a result of their formation through the differentiation of a molten precursor. The presence of these volatile elements is significant, as it suggests that the early solar system was more water-rich than previously thought.

### Subsection 4.1d: Implications of the SNC Meteorites for Early Solar System History

The study of the SNC meteorites has provided valuable insights into the early history of the solar system. Their unique mineral composition and texture, as well as their geochemical characteristics, suggest that they were formed through the differentiation of a molten precursor in a reducing atmosphere. This is significant, as it challenges the traditional view of the early solar system as being primarily composed of chondritic materials.

Furthermore, the presence of volatile elements in the SNC meteorites suggests that the early solar system was more water-rich than previously thought. This has implications for the formation of the Earth and other planetary bodies, as it suggests that water played a significant role in their formation.

In conclusion, the study of the SNC meteorites has provided valuable insights into the early history of the solar system. Their unique mineral composition and texture, as well as their geochemical characteristics, continue to be a topic of debate among researchers and will likely remain a key area of study in the field of igneous petrology.

These rocks are formed through the solidification of molten rock, or magma, and are a crucial component of the Earth's crust. Understanding the processes and mechanisms involved in the formation of igneous rocks is crucial for understanding the dynamics of the Earth's interior and its evolution over time.

In this chapter, we will cover a range of topics, including the use of microscopy, spectroscopy, and geochemical analysis in the study of igneous rocks. We will also explore the principles of magma formation and evolution, as well as the role of volatiles in igneous processes. Additionally, we will discuss the importance of field observations and mapping in the study of igneous rocks.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the techniques used in the study of igneous petrology and their applications in understanding the Earth's crust. So let's dive in and explore the fascinating world of igneous petrology techniques.




### Section: 4.1 Microscopy

Microscopy is a fundamental technique in the study of igneous petrology. It allows us to observe the microstructural features of rocks and minerals, providing valuable information about their formation and evolution. In this section, we will focus on optical microscopy, a commonly used technique in igneous petrology.

#### 4.1a Optical microscopy in igneous petrology

Optical microscopy is a technique that uses visible light to observe the microstructural features of rocks and minerals. It is a non-destructive and relatively quick method, making it an essential tool in the study of igneous petrology.

The basic components of an optical microscope include a light source, a condenser lens, an objective lens, an eyepiece, and a sample stage. The light source, typically a halogen lamp, provides the illumination for the sample. The condenser lens focuses the light onto the sample, while the objective lens magnifies the sample. The eyepiece further magnifies the image, allowing us to observe the microstructural features of the sample.

In igneous petrology, optical microscopy is used to study the mineral composition of rocks. The different minerals present in a rock have varying refractive indices, which determine how much they bend light. By observing the way light is bent as it passes through a thin section of a rock, we can identify the minerals present.

One of the key advantages of optical microscopy is its ability to provide information about the texture of rocks. The arrangement of minerals within a rock can provide insights into the processes involved in its formation. For example, the presence of phenocrysts, large crystals that formed before the surrounding melt, can indicate a rapid cooling process.

Optical microscopy is also used to study the fabric of rocks. The fabric refers to the arrangement of minerals and their intergrowths within a rock. By observing the fabric, we can determine the deformation history of a rock, which can provide insights into the tectonic processes that have acted upon it.

In addition to its use in studying the microstructural features of rocks, optical microscopy is also used in the determination of the chemical composition of rocks. By analyzing the color and transparency of a mineral under different polarizing conditions, we can determine its chemical composition. This technique, known as polarizing microscopy, is particularly useful in the study of silicate minerals.

In conclusion, optical microscopy is a powerful tool in the study of igneous petrology. It allows us to observe the microstructural features of rocks and minerals, providing valuable information about their formation and evolution. By combining optical microscopy with other techniques, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the processes involved in the formation of igneous rocks.





### Subsection: 4.1b Electron microscopy in igneous petrology

Electron microscopy is another powerful technique used in the study of igneous petrology. Unlike optical microscopy, which uses visible light, electron microscopy uses a beam of electrons to illuminate the sample. This allows for much higher magnification and resolution, providing a more detailed view of the microstructural features of rocks and minerals.

#### 4.1b.1 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is a type of electron microscopy that uses a focused beam of electrons to scan the surface of a sample. The electrons interact with the atoms in the sample, producing signals that can be used to determine the chemical composition and topography of the sample.

In igneous petrology, SEM is used to study the mineral composition of rocks. The electrons can penetrate the sample, allowing for the identification of minerals based on their unique electron diffraction patterns. This is particularly useful for studying minerals that are difficult to identify using optical microscopy.

SEM is also used to study the texture and fabric of rocks. The high resolution of SEM allows for the observation of small-scale features, such as grain boundaries and intergrowths, which can provide insights into the processes involved in the formation of the rock.

#### 4.1b.2 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) is another type of electron microscopy that is used in igneous petrology. Unlike SEM, which scans the surface of a sample, TEM passes a beam of electrons through a thin section of the sample. This allows for the observation of the internal structure of the sample, including the arrangement of atoms and defects.

In igneous petrology, TEM is used to study the crystal structure of minerals. The high resolution of TEM allows for the observation of individual atoms, providing valuable information about the composition and structure of minerals.

TEM is also used to study the deformation of rocks. The high resolution of TEM allows for the observation of dislocations and other defects in the crystal structure, which can provide insights into the processes involved in the deformation of rocks.

### Conclusion

Electron microscopy is a powerful tool in the study of igneous petrology. Both SEM and TEM provide valuable information about the mineral composition, texture, and fabric of rocks, allowing for a deeper understanding of the processes involved in their formation and evolution. As technology continues to advance, electron microscopy will undoubtedly play an even more important role in the field of igneous petrology.





### Subsection: 4.2a X-ray fluorescence (XRF) in igneous petrology

X-ray fluorescence (XRF) is a powerful analytical technique used in igneous petrology to determine the chemical composition of rocks and minerals. It is a non-destructive method that can provide information about the major and trace elements present in a sample.

#### 4.2a.1 Principles of XRF

XRF is based on the principle of fluorescence, where the emission of X-rays from a sample is measured after it is excited by a primary X-ray beam. The primary X-ray beam causes the atoms in the sample to emit secondary X-rays, which are characteristic of the elements present in the sample. These secondary X-rays are then measured and used to determine the elemental composition of the sample.

#### 4.2a.2 XRF in Igneous Petrology

In igneous petrology, XRF is used to study the chemical composition of rocks and minerals. It is particularly useful for studying the evolution of magmas and the processes involved in their formation. By analyzing the elemental composition of a magma, researchers can gain insights into the source of the magma, its evolutionary history, and the processes that have influenced its composition.

XRF is also used to study the effects of metamorphism on rocks. By analyzing the changes in elemental composition of a rock before and after metamorphism, researchers can understand the processes involved in metamorphic reactions and the role of different elements in these reactions.

#### 4.2a.3 Advantages and Limitations of XRF

One of the main advantages of XRF is its non-destructive nature, which allows for the analysis of valuable and rare samples without damaging them. XRF is also a rapid and accurate method for determining the elemental composition of rocks and minerals.

However, XRF also has some limitations. It is not as sensitive as other techniques, such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), and it is limited in its ability to analyze very small samples. Additionally, XRF can only provide information about the surface of a sample, and it is not as useful for studying the internal structure of rocks and minerals.

Despite these limitations, XRF remains a valuable tool in the study of igneous petrology, providing researchers with important insights into the composition and evolution of magmas and the processes involved in their formation. 





### Subsection: 4.2b Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) in igneous petrology

Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is a powerful analytical technique used in igneous petrology to determine the chemical composition of rocks and minerals. It is a non-destructive method that can provide information about the major and trace elements present in a sample.

#### 4.2b.1 Principles of ICP-MS

ICP-MS is based on the principle of mass spectrometry, where the mass-to-charge ratio of ions is measured to identify and quantify the elements present in a sample. In ICP-MS, the sample is first atomized and then excited by an inductively coupled plasma. The excited atoms emit ions, which are then separated based on their mass-to-charge ratio using a mass spectrometer. The ions are then detected and their abundance is used to determine the elemental composition of the sample.

#### 4.2b.2 ICP-MS in Igneous Petrology

In igneous petrology, ICP-MS is used to study the chemical composition of rocks and minerals. It is particularly useful for studying the evolution of magmas and the processes involved in their formation. By analyzing the elemental composition of a magma, researchers can gain insights into the source of the magma, its evolutionary history, and the processes that have influenced its composition.

ICP-MS is also used to study the effects of metamorphism on rocks. By analyzing the changes in elemental composition of a rock before and after metamorphism, researchers can understand the processes involved in metamorphic reactions and the role of different elements in these reactions.

#### 4.2b.3 Advantages and Limitations of ICP-MS

One of the main advantages of ICP-MS is its sensitivity, which allows for the detection of very small amounts of elements. It is also a rapid and accurate method for determining the elemental composition of rocks and minerals.

However, ICP-MS also has some limitations. It requires specialized equipment and expertise, making it less accessible than other techniques such as XRF. Additionally, ICP-MS is not as useful for studying the composition of very fine-grained rocks or minerals, as the analysis can be affected by the presence of other elements.

### Subsection: 4.3a Radiogenic isotopes in igneous petrology

Radiogenic isotopes play a crucial role in the study of igneous petrology. These isotopes are formed by the radioactive decay of unstable parent elements, and their presence and distribution can provide valuable information about the origin and evolution of magmas.

#### 4.3a.1 Principles of Radiogenic Isotopes

Radiogenic isotopes are formed when a parent element decays into a daughter element. The rate of this decay is governed by the half-life of the parent element, which is the time it takes for half of the parent element to decay into the daughter element. The decay process is accompanied by the emission of radiation, which can be alpha, beta, or gamma radiation.

The decay of parent elements can be represented by the following equation:

$$
^{A}_{Z}X \rightarrow ^{A}_{Z+1}Y + e^{-} + \bar{\nu}_e + \gamma
$$

where $^{A}_{Z}X$ is the parent element, $^{A}_{Z+1}Y$ is the daughter element, $e^{-}$ is an electron, $\bar{\nu}_e$ is an electron antineutrino, and $\gamma$ is a gamma ray.

#### 4.3a.2 Radiogenic Isotopes in Igneous Petrology

In igneous petrology, radiogenic isotopes are used to study the evolution of magmas. The presence of radiogenic isotopes in a magma can indicate the amount of time that has passed since the magma was formed. This is because the rate of decay of parent elements is constant, and the amount of daughter elements present in a magma can be used to calculate the age of the magma.

Radiogenic isotopes are also used to study the source of magmas. Different sources, such as the mantle or the crust, have different concentrations of parent and daughter elements. By analyzing the ratio of radiogenic isotopes in a magma, researchers can determine the source of the magma and its evolutionary history.

#### 4.3a.3 Advantages and Limitations of Radiogenic Isotopes

One of the main advantages of using radiogenic isotopes in igneous petrology is their ability to provide information about the age and source of magmas. This information can be used to reconstruct the evolution of magmas and the processes involved in their formation.

However, there are also limitations to using radiogenic isotopes. The accuracy of age determinations using radiogenic isotopes is dependent on the accuracy of the decay constants used in the calculations. These constants can vary depending on the element and the conditions under which the decay occurs. Additionally, the presence of daughter elements in a magma can be influenced by processes such as diffusion and assimilation, which can complicate the interpretation of radiogenic isotope data.

In conclusion, radiogenic isotopes are a powerful tool in the study of igneous petrology. They provide valuable information about the age and source of magmas, and their use continues to advance our understanding of the complex processes involved in the formation of igneous rocks.





### Subsection: 4.3b Stable isotopes in igneous petrology

Stable isotopes play a crucial role in the study of igneous petrology. These isotopes are stable and do not undergo radioactive decay, but their distribution and abundance can provide valuable information about the origin and evolution of magmas.

#### 4.3b.1 Principles of Stable Isotopes

Stable isotopes are atoms of the same element that have different numbers of neutrons. The number of neutrons in an atom affects its mass, and therefore its behavior in chemical reactions. Isotopes of the same element have the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons. For example, oxygen has three stable isotopes: oxygen-16, oxygen-17, and oxygen-18. These isotopes have 8, 9, and 10 neutrons, respectively.

The relative abundance of isotopes can be expressed as a ratio, known as the isotopic ratio. For example, the isotopic ratio of oxygen-18 to oxygen-16 in a sample can be expressed as δ18O. This ratio is often expressed in parts per thousand (‰) or parts per million (ppm).

#### 4.3b.2 Stable Isotopes in Igneous Petrology

In igneous petrology, stable isotopes are used to study the origin and evolution of magmas. The distribution of stable isotopes in a magma can provide information about the source of the magma, the processes it has undergone, and the conditions under which it has formed.

For example, the isotopic composition of oxygen in a magma can provide information about the source of the magma. Oxygen-18 is more abundant in water and carbon dioxide than in silicate minerals, so a magma with a high oxygen-18 content may have been in contact with water or carbon dioxide.

The isotopic composition of sulfur in a magma can also provide valuable information. Sulfur-34 is more abundant than sulfur-32 in hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide, but less abundant in sulfate minerals. Therefore, a magma with a high sulfur-34 content may have been in contact with hydrogen sulfide or carbon disulfide.

#### 4.3b.3 Advantages and Limitations of Stable Isotopes

One of the main advantages of using stable isotopes in igneous petrology is their ability to provide information about the origin and evolution of magmas. By studying the distribution and abundance of stable isotopes, researchers can gain insights into the processes that have shaped the magma and its source.

However, there are also limitations to using stable isotopes. For example, the isotopic composition of a magma can be affected by the presence of volatiles, which can introduce errors in the interpretation of the isotopic data. Additionally, the isotopic composition of a magma can change during the course of its evolution, making it difficult to determine the exact conditions under which it has formed.

Despite these limitations, stable isotopes remain a powerful tool in the study of igneous petrology. By combining stable isotope data with other geochemical and geological data, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the origin and evolution of magmas. 





### Section: 4.4 Experimental Petrology

These experiments are typically carried out in specialized facilities equipped with high-pressure and high-temperature chambers, such as the Bridgman anvil, the multi-anvil press, and the laser-heated diamond anvil cell (LHDAC).

##### The Bridgman Anvil

The Bridgman anvil is a high-pressure and high-temperature apparatus that operates by heating a sample between two anvils. The anvils are then separated, causing the sample to deform plastically. The pressure and temperature conditions can be controlled by adjusting the heating rate and the separation speed of the anvils. This technique is particularly useful for studying the behavior of magmas under extreme conditions, such as those found in the Earth's mantle.

##### The Multi-anvil Press

The multi-anvil press is another high-pressure and high-temperature apparatus used in experimental petrology. In this technique, a sample is placed between several anvils, and the pressure is applied by moving the anvils towards each other. The pressure and temperature conditions can be controlled by adjusting the number and arrangement of the anvils, as well as the heating rate. This technique is particularly useful for studying the behavior of magmas under conditions similar to those found in the Earth's lower mantle.

##### The Laser-heated Diamond Anvil Cell (LHDAC)

The LHDAC is a high-pressure and high-temperature apparatus that uses a laser to heat a sample between two diamond anvils. The pressure and temperature conditions can be controlled by adjusting the laser power and the separation distance between the anvils. This technique is particularly useful for studying the behavior of magmas under extreme conditions, such as those found in the Earth's core-mantle boundary.

#### 4.4b Experimental techniques in igneous petrology

In addition to high-pressure and high-temperature experiments, experimental petrology also involves a variety of other techniques. These include volatility experiments, which study the behavior of volatiles in magmas, and crystallization experiments, which study the formation of minerals from magmas. These techniques are crucial for understanding the processes that occur during the formation and evolution of magmas.

##### Volatility Experiments

Volatility experiments are conducted to study the behavior of volatiles, such as water and carbon dioxide, in magmas. These experiments are typically carried out in high-pressure and high-temperature chambers, such as the Bridgman anvil and the multi-anvil press. The behavior of volatiles can be studied by monitoring their release from a magma as it is heated and decompressed. This information can provide insights into the composition and evolution of magmas.

##### Crystallization Experiments

Crystallization experiments are conducted to study the formation of minerals from magmas. These experiments are typically carried out in high-pressure and high-temperature chambers, such as the Bridgman anvil and the multi-anvil press. The behavior of minerals can be studied by monitoring their growth and dissolution as a magma is heated and decompressed. This information can provide insights into the processes that occur during the crystallization of magmas.

In conclusion, experimental petrology is a crucial aspect of igneous petrology, providing a means to study the behavior of magmas under different conditions of pressure and temperature. High-pressure and high-temperature experiments, as well as other experimental techniques, are essential for understanding the formation and evolution of magmas.

#### 4.4c Applications of experimental petrology in igneous petrology

Experimental petrology plays a crucial role in the study of igneous petrology. The techniques discussed in the previous section, such as high-pressure and high-temperature experiments, volatility experiments, and crystallization experiments, have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of magmatic processes. This section will delve into some of the key applications of experimental petrology in igneous petrology.

##### Understanding Magma Formation and Evolution

One of the primary applications of experimental petrology is in understanding the formation and evolution of magmas. By subjecting synthetic magmas to high-pressure and high-temperature conditions, researchers can study how these magmas behave under conditions similar to those found in the Earth's mantle. This can provide insights into the processes that occur during the formation of magmas, such as the separation of different mineral phases and the release of volatiles.

For instance, high-pressure and high-temperature experiments have been used to study the formation of basaltic magmas. These experiments have shown that basaltic magmas can form through the melting of a peridotite source under high pressure and temperature conditions. This process is believed to be responsible for the formation of many of the Earth's oceanic crust and upper mantle rocks.

##### Studying the Effects of Volatiles on Magmas

Experimental petrology is also used to study the effects of volatiles on magmas. Volatiles, such as water and carbon dioxide, can significantly alter the behavior of magmas. For example, the presence of volatiles can reduce the melting point of a magma, leading to the formation of more fluid magmas. This can have important implications for the eruption style of a volcano, with more fluid magmas typically leading to more explosive eruptions.

Volatility experiments, such as those conducted in the LHDAC, allow researchers to study the behavior of volatiles in magmas under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions. These experiments have shown that volatiles can significantly affect the viscosity of a magma, with the release of volatiles leading to a decrease in viscosity. This can have important implications for the eruption style of a volcano, with more viscous magmas typically leading to more effusive eruptions.

##### Investigating the Role of Minerals in Magmas

Experimental petrology is also used to investigate the role of minerals in magmas. Minerals can significantly affect the behavior of a magma, influencing its viscosity, density, and other properties. For instance, the presence of minerals such as olivine and pyroxene can increase the viscosity of a magma, leading to more viscous magmas.

Crystallization experiments, such as those conducted in the Bridgman anvil and the multi-anvil press, allow researchers to study the crystallization of minerals from magmas. These experiments have shown that the crystallization of minerals can significantly affect the behavior of a magma, with the formation of certain minerals leading to changes in the viscosity, density, and other properties of the magma.

In conclusion, experimental petrology plays a crucial role in the study of igneous petrology. By providing a means to study the behavior of magmas under high-pressure and high-temperature conditions, experimental petrology has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of magmatic processes.

### Subsection: 5.1a Partial melting in the mantle

Partial melting is a crucial process in the formation of igneous rocks. It occurs when the temperature and pressure conditions in the mantle cause the melting of only a portion of the mantle material. This process is responsible for the formation of a variety of igneous rocks, including basalt, andesite, and dacite.

#### 5.1a.1 Mechanisms of Partial Melting

There are several mechanisms that can lead to partial melting in the mantle. These include adiabatic heating, conduction, and convection. Adiabatic heating occurs when the mantle material is heated as it descends into the lower mantle. This heating is due to the release of heat from the mantle's potential energy as it moves from a region of high to low pressure. Conduction is the transfer of heat through direct contact of molecules, while convection involves the movement of heat through the mantle material.

#### 5.1a.2 Factors Influencing Partial Melting

The amount of partial melting that occurs in the mantle is influenced by several factors. These include the composition of the mantle material, the temperature and pressure conditions, and the presence of volatiles. The composition of the mantle material plays a significant role in determining the melting behavior. For instance, the presence of iron and magnesium can affect the melting point of the mantle material.

Temperature and pressure conditions also play a crucial role in partial melting. As the mantle material descends into the lower mantle, it experiences an increase in temperature and pressure. This increase can cause the mantle material to reach its melting point, leading to partial melting. The presence of volatiles, such as water, can also lower the melting point of the mantle material, promoting partial melting.

#### 5.1a.3 Implications of Partial Melting

Partial melting in the mantle has significant implications for the formation of igneous rocks. The amount and composition of the melt can influence the type of igneous rock that forms. For instance, a high amount of partial melting can lead to the formation of basalt, while a low amount can result in the formation of andesite or dacite.

Partial melting also plays a crucial role in the process of mantle convection. The movement of the mantle material is driven by the transfer of heat, and partial melting can affect this transfer. The presence of a melt layer can reduce the viscosity of the mantle material, promoting convection and mixing of the mantle material.

In conclusion, partial melting is a complex process that plays a crucial role in the formation of igneous rocks. It is influenced by various factors and has significant implications for the Earth's interior dynamics. Understanding this process is essential for gaining insights into the evolution of the Earth's mantle and the formation of igneous rocks.

## Chapter: Chapter 6: Mantle Melting and Differentiation

### Introduction

The Earth's mantle, a layer of solid rock that lies between the crust and the core, is a dynamic and complex system. It is the source of all the continents and oceanic crust, and its processes play a crucial role in shaping the Earth's surface and interior. In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of mantle melting and differentiation, exploring the processes that govern the formation of the Earth's diverse and dynamic crust.

Mantle melting is a fundamental process in igneous petrology. It is the process by which the mantle, a solid rock, is transformed into a liquid or semi-liquid state. This process is driven by heat, and it is influenced by a variety of factors, including the composition of the mantle, the pressure and temperature conditions, and the presence of volatiles. The study of mantle melting is crucial for understanding the formation of the Earth's crust, as it is the primary source of magma that forms new crust.

Differentiation, on the other hand, refers to the separation of the mantle into distinct layers based on their chemical and physical properties. This process is driven by the density differences between different types of mantle material. The differentiation of the mantle is a key factor in the formation of the Earth's crust, as it leads to the formation of distinct layers of crust with different properties.

In this chapter, we will explore the mechanisms of mantle melting and differentiation, and we will discuss their implications for the formation of the Earth's crust. We will also examine the role of these processes in the evolution of the Earth's interior and surface. By the end of this chapter, you will have a deeper understanding of the complex and dynamic nature of the Earth's mantle, and you will be equipped with the knowledge to further explore this fascinating field.




### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we explored the fundamental concepts of igneous petrology, including the formation and characteristics of igneous rocks. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the process of magma differentiation, a crucial step in the formation of igneous rocks.

Magma differentiation is the process by which a molten rock, or magma, separates into distinct layers or phases based on differences in density, temperature, and chemical composition. This process is fundamental to the formation of many igneous rocks, as it allows for the creation of rocks with distinct textures and mineral assemblages.

In this chapter, we will explore the various factors that influence magma differentiation, including the role of temperature, pressure, and the composition of the magma. We will also discuss the different types of magma differentiation, including fractional melting, fractional crystallization, and differentiation by settling.

Understanding magma differentiation is crucial for understanding the formation of igneous rocks. It allows us to predict the composition and texture of different types of igneous rocks, and provides insights into the processes that shape our planet's crust.

As we delve into the complex world of magma differentiation, we will continue to use the advanced mathematical and computational techniques introduced in the previous chapters. This will allow us to model and simulate the processes of magma differentiation, providing a deeper understanding of this fundamental aspect of igneous petrology.

### 5.2a Fractional crystallization

Fractional crystallization is a common type of magma differentiation that occurs when a magma cools and solidifies, and the minerals within the magma crystallize in order of decreasing melting point. This process is driven by the principle of fractional melting, where different minerals within the magma melt at different temperatures.

#### 5.2a.1 Fractional Melting

Fractional melting is a key concept in the process of magma differentiation. It occurs when a magma is heated to a temperature above its melting point, causing it to melt. However, not all minerals within the magma melt at the same temperature. Some minerals, such as olivine and pyroxene, have lower melting points than others, such as plagioclase and alkali feldspar.

As the magma is heated, these minerals with lower melting points will melt first, forming a liquid phase. The remaining solid minerals, with higher melting points, will continue to heat and eventually melt, adding to the liquid phase. This process results in a complex mixture of melt and solid minerals, known as a magma.

#### 5.2a.2 Fractional Crystallization

As the magma cools and solidifies, the minerals within the magma will crystallize in order of decreasing melting point. This is because the minerals with lower melting points will crystallize first, as they have already been melted. The remaining melt will then cool and crystallize the minerals with higher melting points.

This process can result in the formation of distinct layers or phases within the magma, each with a different mineral assemblage. This is known as fractional crystallization. The layers can be identified by their different mineral assemblages, textures, and colors.

#### 5.2a.3 Factors Influencing Fractional Crystallization

The efficiency of fractional crystallization is influenced by several factors, including the composition of the magma, the temperature and pressure conditions, and the mineral assemblage. Magmas with higher silica content tend to be more viscous, which can slow down the crystallization process and increase the efficiency of fractional crystallization.

Temperature and pressure conditions can also affect the efficiency of fractional crystallization. Higher temperatures can promote faster crystallization, while higher pressures can inhibit crystallization. The mineral assemblage within the magma can also influence the efficiency of fractional crystallization, as different minerals have different melting points and crystallization rates.

#### 5.2a.4 Applications of Fractional Crystallization

Fractional crystallization plays a crucial role in the formation of many igneous rocks. It allows for the creation of rocks with distinct textures and mineral assemblages, providing insights into the processes that shape our planet's crust.

In addition, fractional crystallization has important applications in the petroleum industry. The separation of oil and gas from rock is often achieved through a process of fractional crystallization, where the oil and gas are separated from the solid minerals in the rock.

In the next section, we will explore another type of magma differentiation, known as differentiation by settling.

### 5.2b Differentiation by settling

Differentiation by settling is another common type of magma differentiation that occurs when minerals within a magma settle at different rates due to their density. This process is driven by the principle of density, where minerals with higher densities will settle first, followed by minerals with lower densities.

#### 5.2b.1 Density and Settling

The density of a mineral is determined by its composition and crystal structure. Minerals with higher densities, such as olivine and pyroxene, will settle first, as they are more dense than the melt. The remaining minerals, with lower densities, will continue to float in the melt until they also reach their settling point.

As the magma cools and solidifies, the minerals within the magma will also change in density. This is because the minerals will crystallize at different temperatures, and as they crystallize, their density will increase. This can lead to further settling and differentiation within the magma.

#### 5.2b.2 Factors Influencing Settling

The efficiency of differentiation by settling is influenced by several factors, including the composition of the magma, the temperature and pressure conditions, and the mineral assemblage. Magmas with higher silica content tend to be more viscous, which can slow down the settling process and increase the efficiency of differentiation by settling.

Temperature and pressure conditions can also affect the efficiency of differentiation by settling. Higher temperatures can promote faster crystallization, which can lead to more efficient settling. Higher pressures can also inhibit crystallization, which can slow down the settling process.

The mineral assemblage within the magma can also influence the efficiency of differentiation by settling. Different minerals have different densities and crystallization temperatures, which can affect how they settle within the magma.

#### 5.2b.3 Applications of Differentiation by Settling

Differentiation by settling plays a crucial role in the formation of many igneous rocks. It allows for the creation of distinct layers or phases within the magma, each with a different mineral assemblage. This can result in the formation of layered igneous rocks, such as gabbros and diorites.

In addition, differentiation by settling can also occur in the formation of plutonic rocks, where the magma is trapped beneath the Earth's crust and cools slowly. This can lead to the formation of complex layered intrusions, such as the Bushveld Complex in South Africa.

Overall, understanding the process of differentiation by settling is essential for understanding the formation of many igneous rocks and their mineral assemblages. It is a complex process that is influenced by a variety of factors, and further research is needed to fully understand its role in igneous petrogenesis.

### 5.2c Applications of magma differentiation

Magma differentiation plays a crucial role in the formation of igneous rocks. The processes of fractional crystallization and differentiation by settling are responsible for the creation of distinct layers or phases within the magma, each with a different mineral assemblage. This can result in the formation of a variety of igneous rocks, each with its own unique characteristics.

#### 5.2c.1 Fractional Crystallization and Igneous Petrology

Fractional crystallization is a key process in the formation of many igneous rocks. As a magma cools and solidifies, minerals with lower melting points will crystallize first, followed by minerals with higher melting points. This results in the formation of distinct layers or phases within the magma, each with a different mineral assemblage.

For example, the formation of granite, a common igneous rock, is often the result of fractional crystallization. As a magma cools and solidifies, minerals such as quartz and feldspar will crystallize first, followed by minerals such as mica. This results in the formation of a layered rock with distinct layers of different minerals.

#### 5.2c.2 Differentiation by Settling and Igneous Petrology

Differentiation by settling is another important process in the formation of igneous rocks. As minerals within a magma settle at different rates due to their density, distinct layers or phases can be formed within the magma. This can result in the formation of layered igneous rocks, such as gabbros and diorites.

For example, the formation of gabbros, a common igneous rock, is often the result of differentiation by settling. As a magma cools and solidifies, minerals such as olivine and pyroxene will settle first, followed by minerals such as plagioclase feldspar. This results in the formation of a layered rock with distinct layers of different minerals.

#### 5.2c.3 Applications of Magma Differentiation in Geology

The study of magma differentiation has many applications in geology. By understanding the processes of fractional crystallization and differentiation by settling, geologists can better understand the formation of igneous rocks and their mineral assemblages. This can provide valuable insights into the history of the Earth's crust and the processes that shape it.

In addition, the study of magma differentiation has important implications for the petroleum industry. The separation of oil and gas from rock is often achieved through a process of fractional crystallization, where the oil and gas are separated from the solid minerals in the rock. By understanding the principles of magma differentiation, geologists can better predict the distribution of oil and gas within a rock, aiding in the exploration and extraction of these valuable resources.

## Chapter: Chapter 6: Igneous Petrology of the Moon

### Introduction

The Moon, our closest celestial neighbor, has long been a subject of fascination and exploration. Its surface, marked by craters and seas, has been studied extensively by astronomers and geologists. However, the Moon's interior, particularly its petrology, remains a mystery. This chapter, "Igneous Petrology of the Moon," aims to shed light on this intriguing subject.

The Moon's petrology, or the study of its rocks, is a complex and multifaceted field. It involves understanding the composition, structure, and evolution of the Moon's rocks, which are primarily igneous in nature. Igneous petrology is the study of rocks that have been formed by the cooling and solidification of molten rock, or magma. This process is fundamental to the Moon's geological history and the formation of its surface features.

In this chapter, we will delve into the unique characteristics of the Moon's igneous rocks, including their mineral composition, texture, and structure. We will also explore the processes that have shaped these rocks, such as crystallization, melting, and metamorphism. Furthermore, we will discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of the Moon's history and evolution.

The study of the Moon's igneous petrology is not just an academic exercise. It has practical implications as well. For instance, the Moon's rocks could potentially be a source of valuable resources for future human exploration and settlement. Understanding their petrology could therefore be crucial for the success of such endeavors.

This chapter will provide a comprehensive overview of the Moon's igneous petrology, combining theoretical concepts with practical examples. It will be a valuable resource for advanced undergraduate students at MIT and other institutions, as well as for researchers and professionals in the field of geology and planetary science.

As we journey through the Moon's petrology, we will uncover the secrets of its igneous rocks, shedding light on the Moon's past and paving the way for its future.




#### 5.2b Magma mixing

Magma mixing is another important process in magma differentiation. It occurs when two or more magmas come into contact and form a new magma with a composition somewhere between the two end-member magmas. This process is common in volcanic magma chambers, which are open-system chambers where magmas enter, undergo some form of assimilation, fractional crystallization, and partial melt extraction, and are replenished.

#### 5.2b.1 Mechanisms of Magma Mixing

There are several mechanisms by which magma mixing can occur. These include:

- **Conduit mixing**: This occurs when two magmas meet in a conduit leading to the surface. The magmas can mix as they move down the conduit, resulting in a new magma with a composition somewhere between the two end-member magmas.

- **Reservoir mixing**: This occurs in a magma reservoir, where magmas can mix due to turbulent flow or convection. This can result in a more homogeneous magma composition.

- **Assimilation**: This occurs when a magma incorporates surrounding rocks and their minerals, changing the composition of the magma. This can result in the formation of new minerals and the crystallization of different minerals.

- **Partial melt extraction**: This occurs when a magma is erupted at the surface, resulting in the extraction of partial melt. This can change the composition of the remaining magma, leading to further differentiation.

#### 5.2b.2 Implications of Magma Mixing

Magma mixing can have significant implications for the composition and evolution of magmas. It can result in the formation of new minerals, the crystallization of different minerals, and the creation of more complex magma compositions. This can also lead to changes in the viscosity and explosivity of the magma, affecting the style of volcanic eruption.

In the case of the 1954 Kilauea caldera eruption, magma mixing played a crucial role in the evolution of the eruption. The eruption was characterized by the mixing of two different magma compositions, resulting in a more complex magma with a higher ratio of CaO to MgO. This led to changes in the eruption style, with later episodes being more explosive and resulting in the formation of different types of lava flows.

#### 5.2b.3 Magma Mixing in Other Volcanic Systems

Magma mixing is not limited to the Kilauea volcano. It is a common process in many volcanic systems, including mid-ocean ridges, where magmas can mix and form new compositions. This can have significant implications for the evolution of these volcanic systems and the formation of new igneous rocks.

In conclusion, magma mixing is a crucial process in magma differentiation. It can result in the formation of more complex magma compositions and can have significant implications for the evolution of volcanic systems. Further research and study of magma mixing are needed to fully understand its role in igneous petrogenesis.





#### 5.3a Magma ascent mechanisms

The ascent of magma is a crucial step in the formation of igneous rocks. It involves the movement of magma from the source, typically a mantle plume or a magma chamber, to the surface. The mechanisms of magma ascent are complex and involve a combination of physical processes, including buoyancy, convection, and fracture propagation.

#### 5.3a.1 Buoyancy

Buoyancy is the upward force exerted by a fluid that opposes the weight of an immersed object. In the context of magma ascent, buoyancy is the force that drives the magma upward. The density of magma is typically lower than the density of the surrounding rocks, which gives it a buoyant force. This force increases with depth, as the pressure and temperature increase with depth, causing the density of the magma to decrease.

The buoyancy force can be calculated using Archimedes' principle, which states that the buoyant force is equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. For magma ascent, the displaced fluid is the surrounding rock. The buoyancy force can be expressed as:

$$
F_b = \rho_{magma} \cdot g \cdot V - \rho_{rock} \cdot g \cdot V
$$

where $F_b$ is the buoyancy force, $\rho_{magma}$ and $\rho_{rock}$ are the densities of the magma and the rock, respectively, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $V$ is the volume of the magma.

#### 5.3a.2 Convection

Convection is the transfer of heat by the movement of a fluid. In the context of magma ascent, convection is the movement of magma caused by heat transfer. The heat transfer can be due to conduction, where heat is transferred through direct contact, or radiation, where heat is transferred through electromagnetic waves.

Convection can drive magma ascent by creating a buoyant force. As the magma moves upward, it cools and becomes denser. This denser magma sinks, creating a convective flow. The convective flow can continue until the magma reaches the surface, where it is erupted as a volcanic eruption.

#### 5.3a.3 Fracture Propagation

Fracture propagation is a mechanism of magma ascent that involves the movement of magma along fractures or faults in the surrounding rocks. The magma can enter these fractures or faults and move along them, pushing aside the surrounding rock. This mechanism is particularly important in the upper crust, where the rocks are brittle and do not deform easily.

Fracture propagation can occur through two main processes: diapirism and stoping. Diapirism is the upward movement of a magma body through the surrounding rock. Stoping, on the other hand, is the upward movement of a magma body through the roof rocks, which are removed as the magma rises.

In conclusion, the ascent of magma is a complex process that involves a combination of physical processes. These processes work together to drive the magma upward, ultimately leading to the formation of igneous rocks. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for understanding the formation of igneous rocks and the evolution of the Earth's crust.

#### 5.3b Emplacement mechanisms

The emplacement of magma is the process by which magma is injected into the crust and forms igneous intrusions. This process is crucial in the formation of many types of igneous rocks, including granite, diorite, and gabbro. The emplacement of magma can occur through various mechanisms, including diapirism, stoping, and sill formation.

#### 5.3b.1 Diapirism

Diapirism is a mechanism of magma emplacement that involves the upward movement of a magma body through the surrounding rock. This process is driven by the buoyancy of the magma, which is less dense than the surrounding rock. As the magma rises, it displaces the surrounding rock, creating a diapir.

The diapir can continue to rise until it reaches a level where its buoyancy is balanced by the weight of the overlying rock. At this point, the diapir may stop rising and form a magma chamber. Alternatively, the diapir may continue to rise and eventually reach the surface, where it can form a volcanic eruption.

#### 5.3b.2 Stoping

Stoping is a mechanism of magma emplacement that involves the upward movement of a magma body through the roof rocks. This process is similar to diapirism, but it occurs in the upper crust, where the rocks are typically more brittle and less ductile than in the lower crust.

As the magma rises, it displaces the roof rocks, which can form a pile of blocks above the magma body. This process can continue until the magma reaches the surface, where it can form a volcanic eruption.

#### 5.3b.3 Sill Formation

Sill formation is a mechanism of magma emplacement that involves the horizontal movement of magma between layers of rock. This process is driven by the pressure of the magma, which can force its way between the layers of rock.

As the magma moves horizontally, it can form a sill, which is a thin layer of magma that intrudes between the layers of rock. The sill can continue to grow until it reaches a level where its pressure is balanced by the weight of the overlying rock. At this point, the sill may stop growing and form a magma chamber.

In conclusion, the emplacement of magma is a complex process that involves a combination of physical processes, including diapirism, stoping, and sill formation. These processes can occur in different parts of the crust and can result in the formation of various types of igneous intrusions.

## Chapter: Chapter 6: Igneous Textures and Structures

### Introduction

The study of igneous petrology is a fascinating journey into the heart of the Earth, exploring the processes that shape our planet's crust and mantle. In this chapter, we delve into the intriguing world of igneous textures and structures, a critical aspect of understanding the formation and evolution of igneous rocks.

Igneous textures refer to the arrangement of minerals within a rock, which can provide valuable insights into the conditions under which the rock was formed. These textures can be coarse or fine, depending on the size of the mineral grains. They can also be crystalline or aphanitic, indicating whether the rock has undergone crystallization or not.

On the other hand, igneous structures are the result of the deformation of igneous rocks. These structures can be planar or linear, and they can provide information about the forces that acted upon the rock, such as compression or extension. They can also reveal the direction of the rock's movement, known as the flow direction.

In this chapter, we will explore these concepts in detail, using mathematical equations and diagrams to illustrate the principles involved. For instance, we might use the equation `$\Delta T = \frac{Q}{mC}$` to describe the change in temperature of a rock, where `$\Delta T$` is the change in temperature, `$Q$` is the heat added, `$m$` is the mass of the rock, and `$C$` is the specific heat capacity of the rock.

We will also discuss the various types of igneous textures and structures, and how they can be identified and interpreted. For example, we might discuss the difference between porphyritic and aphanitic textures, or the formation of joints and fractures in igneous rocks.

By the end of this chapter, you should have a solid understanding of igneous textures and structures, and be able to apply this knowledge to the study of igneous rocks. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for the subsequent chapters, where we will delve deeper into the fascinating world of igneous petrology.




#### 5.3b Magma emplacement processes

The emplacement of magma is a critical step in the formation of igneous rocks. It involves the deposition of magma at a specific location, typically a volcanic conduit or a magma chamber. The processes of magma emplacement are complex and involve a combination of physical processes, including gravity, viscosity, and pressure.

#### 5.3b.1 Gravity

Gravity is the force that drives the downward movement of magma. The force of gravity is proportional to the mass of the magma and the acceleration due to gravity. The force can be expressed as:

$$
F_g = m \cdot g
$$

where $F_g$ is the force of gravity, $m$ is the mass of the magma, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

The force of gravity can overcome the buoyancy force if the density of the magma is higher than the density of the surrounding rock. In this case, the magma will sink downward.

#### 5.3b.2 Viscosity

Viscosity is a measure of a fluid's resistance to shear or flow. In the context of magma emplacement, viscosity is the resistance of the magma to flow. The viscosity of magma is influenced by several factors, including temperature, pressure, and the composition of the magma.

Magma with high viscosity is thick and resistant to flow, while magma with low viscosity is thin and flows easily. The viscosity of magma can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
\eta = A \cdot e^{B \cdot T}
$$

where $\eta$ is the viscosity, $A$ and $B$ are constants, and $T$ is the temperature.

The viscosity of magma can affect the emplacement process. Magma with high viscosity tends to form intrusive igneous rocks, as it is resistant to flow and tends to cool and solidify in place. On the other hand, magma with low viscosity can form extrusive igneous rocks, as it flows easily and can reach the surface to form volcanic rocks.

#### 5.3b.3 Pressure

Pressure is another important factor in magma emplacement. The pressure at which magma is emplaced can affect the viscosity of the magma and the type of igneous rock that forms. High pressure can increase the viscosity of the magma, making it more resistant to flow. Conversely, low pressure can decrease the viscosity of the magma, making it more fluid and prone to flow.

The pressure at which magma is emplaced can also affect the density of the magma. As pressure increases with depth, the density of the magma decreases. This can lead to the formation of a buoyant force, which can drive the upward movement of magma.

In conclusion, the emplacement of magma is a complex process that involves the interplay of various physical processes. Understanding these processes is crucial for understanding the formation of igneous rocks and the evolution of the Earth's crust.

#### 5.3c Case studies of magma ascent and emplacement

In this section, we will explore some case studies that illustrate the processes of magma ascent and emplacement. These case studies will provide a more concrete understanding of the concepts discussed in the previous sections.

##### Cerro del Azufre

Cerro del Azufre is a volcanic complex located in the Altiplano-Puna volcanic complex (APVC) in the Andes Mountains. The APVC is linked to the Altiplano-Puna Magma Body, a large body of partially molten rock that may be the source of heat for geothermal fields and of magma for lava domes emplaced in the area during the last 120,000 years.

The volcanic activity at Cerro del Azufre has been influenced by northwest-southeast trending strike-slip faults, including the Azufre-Inacaliri lineament. These faults have been associated with the formation of ore deposits and the emplacement of lava domes.

Seismic tomography has found low-velocity anomalies under Cerro del Azufre that may be magma chambers. This suggests that magma ascent and emplacement have occurred at this location.

##### Newbury Volcanic Complex

The Newbury Volcanic Complex in New Hampshire, USA, provides another example of magma ascent and emplacement. The complex is composed of a series of rhyolite tuffs and basaltic rocks.

The basaltic rocks, found in Member 5, are dark-gray in color and contain small outlines of plagioclase grains. These rocks were deposited from a local flow or volcanic intrusion.

The rhyolite rocks, found in Member 6, are flow-banded and contain vitrophyre. These rocks were emplaced from a magma chamber at a higher level than the basaltic rocks.

The emplacement of these rocks provides an example of the complex processes involved in magma ascent and emplacement, including the role of buoyancy, viscosity, and pressure.

##### Conclusion

These case studies illustrate the complex processes involved in magma ascent and emplacement. They highlight the role of various factors, including gravity, viscosity, and pressure, in determining the path and fate of magma. They also underscore the importance of understanding these processes in interpreting the geological history of volcanic systems.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the fascinating world of igneous petrogenesis, exploring the processes that lead to the formation of igneous rocks.

#### 5.4a Eruption styles and products

Volcanic eruptions are among the most dramatic and destructive natural phenomena on Earth. They are the culmination of the complex processes involved in magma formation and emplacement, and they result in the creation of a wide range of volcanic products. These products can be broadly categorized into two types: extrusive and intrusive.

#### 5.4a.1 Extrusive Volcanic Products

Extrusive volcanic products are those that are erupted at the surface of the Earth. They include lava flows, pyroclastic flows, and volcanic ash. These products are typically formed during explosive volcanic eruptions, where the pressure and temperature conditions are such that the magma is fragmented into smaller pieces before it reaches the surface.

##### Lava Flows

Lava flows are the most common type of extrusive volcanic product. They are formed when magma is erupted at the surface and flows out in a stream. The composition of the lava flow can vary widely, depending on the composition of the magma and the conditions under which it is erupted. For example, basaltic magmas, which are rich in iron and magnesium, tend to produce dark, viscous lava flows. On the other hand, rhyolitic magmas, which are rich in silica, tend to produce light, thin lava flows.

##### Pyroclastic Flows

Pyroclastic flows are another type of extrusive volcanic product. They are formed when a mixture of hot gas and rock fragments is erupted at the surface. The mixture is typically very hot and can flow rapidly down the volcanic slope, burying everything in its path. Pyroclastic flows can be extremely destructive, as they can reach temperatures of over 700°C and can travel at speeds of up to 70 km/h.

##### Volcanic Ash

Volcanic ash is a fine-grained, powdery material that is erupted at the surface during explosive volcanic eruptions. It is formed when the magma is fragmented into small pieces by the high pressure and temperature conditions in the volcanic conduit. Volcanic ash can be highly destructive, as it can be carried long distances by the wind and can cause significant damage to infrastructure and human health.

#### 5.4a.2 Intrusive Volcanic Products

Intrusive volcanic products are those that are formed beneath the surface of the Earth. They include sills, dikes, and batholiths. These products are typically formed during effusive volcanic eruptions, where the pressure and temperature conditions are such that the magma is able to cool and solidify before it reaches the surface.

##### Sills

Sills are thin layers of igneous rock that are formed when magma is injected between two layers of rock. They are typically horizontal and can be very large, extending over areas of several square kilometers. Sills are often formed in conjunction with other intrusive igneous structures, such as dikes and batholiths.

##### Dikes

Dikes are thin, vertical sheets of igneous rock that are formed when magma is injected along a fracture in the rock. They can be very large, extending over areas of several square kilometers, and they can be found at all scales, from microscopic to mountain-sized. Dikes are often formed in conjunction with other intrusive igneous structures, such as sills and batholiths.

##### Batholiths

Batholiths are large, intrusive igneous bodies that are formed when magma is injected into the crust and cools and solidifies beneath the surface. They can be very large, extending over areas of hundreds of square kilometers, and they can be found at all scales, from microscopic to mountain-sized. Batholiths are often formed in conjunction with other intrusive igneous structures, such as sills and dikes.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the processes involved in volcanic eruptions and the formation of these extrusive and intrusive volcanic products.

#### 5.4b Volcanic hazards

Volcanic hazards are the potential dangers associated with volcanic activity. These hazards can be direct, such as lava flows, pyroclastic flows, and volcanic ash, or indirect, such as volcanic gases and hydrothermal explosions. Understanding these hazards is crucial for predicting volcanic activity and mitigating the potential impacts.

##### Lava Flows

Lava flows, as discussed in the previous section, are one of the most common types of volcanic hazards. They can be extremely destructive, particularly when they enter populated areas. The viscosity of the lava, which is a measure of its resistance to flow, plays a crucial role in determining the destructive potential of a lava flow. High-viscosity lavas, which are common in basaltic systems, can form thick, blocky flows that can destroy everything in their path. On the other hand, low-viscosity lavas, which are common in rhyolitic systems, can form thin, fluid flows that can inundate large areas and bury everything under several meters of lava.

##### Pyroclastic Flows

Pyroclastic flows, another common type of volcanic hazard, can be even more destructive than lava flows. These flows are typically composed of a mixture of hot gas and rock fragments, and they can reach temperatures of over 700°C. They can travel at speeds of up to 70 km/h and can bury everything in their path. The destructive potential of pyroclastic flows is further increased by their ability to flow down valleys and into populated areas.

##### Volcanic Ash

Volcanic ash is another type of volcanic hazard that can have far-reaching impacts. It is composed of small fragments of rock and minerals that are erupted at the surface during explosive volcanic eruptions. These fragments can be carried long distances by the wind and can cause significant damage to infrastructure and human health. Volcanic ash can also pose a threat to aviation, as it can damage aircraft engines and interfere with radar systems.

##### Volcanic Gases

Volcanic gases, including hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen chloride, can also pose significant hazards. These gases can be toxic when inhaled, and they can also contribute to the acidification of lakes and the ocean. Volcanic gases can also cause hydrothermal explosions, which can be particularly dangerous when they occur beneath the sea.

In conclusion, understanding the various types of volcanic hazards and their potential impacts is crucial for predicting volcanic activity and mitigating the potential impacts. This understanding can be used to develop early warning systems and disaster preparedness plans, which can save lives and property during volcanic eruptions.

#### 5.4c Volcanic products and processes

Volcanic products and processes are the result of the complex interplay of magmatic, hydrothermal, and atmospheric systems. These systems interact to produce a wide range of volcanic products, including lava flows, pyroclastic flows, and volcanic ash. Understanding these products and processes is crucial for predicting volcanic activity and mitigating the potential impacts.

##### Lava Flows

Lava flows are one of the most common types of volcanic products. They are formed when molten rock, or magma, reaches the surface and cools and solidifies. The composition of the lava, which is determined by the composition of the magma, plays a crucial role in determining the type of lava flow. Basaltic magmas, which are rich in iron and magnesium, tend to produce dark, viscous lava flows. On the other hand, rhyolitic magmas, which are rich in silica, tend to produce light, fluid lava flows.

##### Pyroclastic Flows

Pyroclastic flows are another common type of volcanic product. They are formed when a mixture of hot gas and rock fragments is erupted at the surface. This mixture, known as a pyroclastic flow, can reach temperatures of over 700°C and can travel at speeds of up to 70 km/h. Pyroclastic flows can be extremely destructive, as they can bury everything in their path.

##### Volcanic Ash

Volcanic ash is a fine-grained, powdery material that is erupted at the surface during explosive volcanic eruptions. It is composed of small fragments of rock and minerals that are blasted into the air and then fall back to the surface as ash. Volcanic ash can be carried long distances by the wind and can cause significant damage to infrastructure and human health.

##### Hydrothermal Processes

Hydrothermal processes are another important aspect of volcanic products and processes. These processes involve the interaction of hot fluids, typically derived from the magma, with the surrounding rocks. This interaction can lead to the formation of hydrothermal alteration assemblages, which can provide valuable information about the composition and evolution of the magma.

##### Atmospheric Processes

Atmospheric processes also play a crucial role in volcanic products and processes. These processes involve the interaction of volcanic gases with the atmosphere. Volcanic gases, including hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen chloride, can pose significant hazards to human health and the environment. They can also contribute to climate change by increasing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

In conclusion, understanding the various types of volcanic products and processes is crucial for predicting volcanic activity and mitigating the potential impacts. This understanding can be used to develop early warning systems and disaster preparedness plans, which can save lives and property during volcanic eruptions.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have delved into the fascinating world of igneous petrogenesis, exploring the processes that lead to the formation of igneous rocks. We have learned that igneous rocks are formed from the cooling and solidification of molten rock, or magma, and that the composition of these rocks can provide valuable insights into the conditions under which they were formed.

We have also examined the various factors that influence the formation of igneous rocks, including the composition of the magma, the pressure and temperature conditions under which it cools, and the presence of certain minerals or gases.

Volcano monitoring and hazard assessment are crucial components of volcanology. They involve the use of various techniques to monitor volcanic activity and assess the potential hazards associated with volcanic eruptions. This section will discuss the techniques used in volcano monitoring and hazard assessment.

#### 5.4b.1 Volcano Monitoring Techniques

Volcano monitoring techniques are used to detect and track changes in volcanic activity. These techniques can be broadly categorized into two types: direct and indirect.

##### Direct Monitoring Techniques

Direct monitoring techniques involve the direct observation of volcanic activity. This can be done through visual inspection, seismic monitoring, and gas analysis.

- Visual Inspection: This involves observing the volcano directly for signs of activity such as steam plumes, lava flows, and changes in the shape of the volcanic cone.
- Seismic Monitoring: Seismic monitoring involves the use of seismometers to detect and record seismic activity. This can provide valuable information about the location, magnitude, and frequency of earthquakes, which can be indicative of volcanic activity.
- Gas Analysis: Gas analysis involves the collection and analysis of gases emitted by the volcano. This can provide information about the composition of the magma and the rate of magma production.

##### Indirect Monitoring Techniques

Indirect monitoring techniques involve the use of remote sensing methods to detect changes in volcanic activity. These methods can be used to monitor volcanic activity from a distance, which can be particularly useful for monitoring large, remote volcanoes.

- Satellite Imagery: Satellite imagery can be used to monitor changes in the shape and size of the volcanic cone, as well as to detect changes in surface temperature, which can be indicative of volcanic activity.
- Ground Deformation Monitoring: Ground deformation monitoring involves the use of techniques such as GPS and InSAR to detect changes in the shape and size of the volcanic edifice. This can provide valuable information about the movement of magma beneath the volcano.

#### 5.4b.2 Volcano Hazard Assessment

Volcano hazard assessment involves the evaluation of the potential hazards associated with volcanic eruptions. This can be done through the use of various techniques, including volcanic risk assessment and volcanic hazard mapping.

##### Volcanic Risk Assessment

Volcanic risk assessment involves the evaluation of the potential impacts of volcanic eruptions on human populations and infrastructure. This can be done through the use of various techniques, including volcanic hazard assessment, vulnerability assessment, and risk modeling.

##### Volcanic Hazard Mapping

Volcanic hazard mapping involves the creation of maps that show the potential distribution of volcanic hazards, such as lava flows, pyroclastic flows, and ash falls. These maps can be used to identify areas that are at risk of volcanic hazards and to plan for emergency response and evacuation.

#### 5.4b.3 Volcano Monitoring and Hazard Assessment in Iceland

In Iceland, volcano monitoring and hazard assessment are particularly important due to the country's high level of volcanic activity. The Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) is responsible for monitoring volcanic activity in Iceland. The IMO uses a variety of techniques, including seismic monitoring, gas analysis, and satellite imagery, to monitor volcanic activity in Iceland. The IMO also conducts regular hazard assessments to evaluate the potential impacts of volcanic eruptions on human populations and infrastructure.

#### 5.4b.4 The 2014–2015 Eruption of Bárðarbunga

The 2014–2015 eruption of Bárðarbunga, one of Iceland's largest volcanoes, provides a recent example of the importance of volcano monitoring and hazard assessment. The eruption, which occurred in the Baugur crater, was preceded by a period of increased seismic activity and subsidence of the caldera. The IMO's regular monitoring and hazard assessment allowed them to detect and track the changes in volcanic activity, and to issue timely warnings to the local population.

The eruption resulted in the formation of a large lava field, which covered an area of approximately 76 km and had an estimated volume of 1 cubic kilometre. The eruption also resulted in significant sulphur dioxide gas pollution, which had a significant impact on air quality in the region. The IMO's regular monitoring and hazard assessment allowed them to accurately assess the potential impacts of the eruption, and to respond effectively to the emergency.

In conclusion, volcano monitoring and hazard assessment are crucial components of volcanology. They involve the use of various techniques to monitor volcanic activity and assess the potential hazards associated with volcanic eruptions.

## Chapter: - Chapter 6: Igneous Rock Associations:

### Introduction

In the previous chapters, we have explored the fundamental concepts of igneous petrology, including the formation and characteristics of different types of igneous rocks. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the study of igneous rock associations, which are groups of igneous rocks that occur together in a specific geological setting. These associations provide valuable insights into the processes and conditions that govern the formation of igneous rocks.

The study of igneous rock associations is crucial in understanding the evolution of the Earth's crust and mantle. It allows us to reconstruct the tectonic history of a region and identify the underlying processes that have shaped the Earth's surface. By examining the composition and distribution of igneous rocks, we can gain insights into the chemical and physical conditions of the magmatic system that produced them.

In this chapter, we will explore the different types of igneous rock associations, including their formation, characteristics, and significance. We will also discuss the various factors that influence the formation of these associations, such as the composition of the mantle, the presence of volatiles, and the influence of the surrounding environment. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of the complex world of igneous rock associations and their role in the study of igneous petrology.




### Subsection: 6.1a Mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs)

Mid-ocean ridges are underwater mountain ranges that form the backbone of the oceanic crust. They are sites of intense volcanic activity and are responsible for the formation of a significant portion of the Earth's crust. The volcanism at mid-ocean ridges is primarily driven by the process of seafloor spreading, where new crust is formed as the Earth's plates move apart. This process is responsible for the formation of mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs), which are the most common type of oceanic igneous rock.

#### 6.1a Mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs)

MORBs are tholeiitic basalts, meaning they have a low silica content and are rich in iron and magnesium. They are formed through the decompression melting of the Earth's mantle, which occurs as the mantle rises towards the surface along the mid-ocean ridges. The melting process is influenced by the presence of volatiles, such as water and carbon dioxide, which can lower the melting point of the mantle and increase the amount of melt produced.

The composition of MORBs is relatively uniform, with a high iron and magnesium content and a low silica content. This is due to the fact that they are formed through a relatively simple melting process, with little to no differentiation occurring between different minerals. However, there are some variations in the composition of MORBs, which can provide valuable insights into the processes occurring at mid-ocean ridges.

One of the key factors that influences the composition of MORBs is the presence of volatiles. The presence of water and carbon dioxide can significantly lower the melting point of the mantle, leading to increased melt production. This can result in the formation of more silica-rich MORBs, known as high-velocity MORBs. These rocks have a higher velocity than normal MORBs, which can be detected using seismic techniques.

Another factor that can influence the composition of MORBs is the presence of hotspots. Hotspots are areas of intense volcanic activity that are not associated with plate boundaries. They are often found above mantle plumes, which are columns of hot, buoyant mantle material that rise towards the surface. The presence of hotspots can lead to the formation of more silica-rich MORBs, known as hotspot MORBs. These rocks have a higher silica content and are often associated with the formation of oceanic plateaus, such as the Hawaiian Islands.

In addition to their role in the formation of oceanic crust, MORBs also play a crucial role in the carbon cycle. The presence of volatiles, such as carbon dioxide, in the mantle can lead to the formation of carbonate minerals in MORBs. These minerals can then be transported to the surface and released into the atmosphere, contributing to the carbon cycle.

In conclusion, MORBs are a crucial component of the Earth's oceanic crust and play a significant role in the formation of new crust through the process of seafloor spreading. Their composition and variations can provide valuable insights into the processes occurring at mid-ocean ridges, including the role of volatiles and hotspots. Furthermore, their role in the carbon cycle highlights their importance in regulating the Earth's climate. 





### Subsection: 6.1b Ocean island basalts (OIBs)

Ocean island basalts (OIBs) are a type of igneous rock that is found on oceanic islands, such as Hawaii and Iceland. They are formed through the melting of the Earth's mantle, similar to MORBs, but with some key differences in their composition and formation processes.

#### 6.1b Ocean island basalts (OIBs)

OIBs are more diverse in composition than MORBs, with a higher proportion of alkali basalt. This is due to the presence of mantle plumes, which are columns of hot, buoyant mantle material that rise from the core-mantle boundary. These plumes can bring up material from the lower mantle, which has a higher alkali content than the upper mantle.

The composition of OIBs is also influenced by the mixing of different mantle components. These components include HIMU (high-velocity, high-alkali), EM1 (enriched in lanthanides), and EM2 (enriched in heavy rare earth elements). The presence of these components can result in variations in the composition of OIBs, with some being more enriched in trace elements and others being more silica-rich.

The formation of OIBs is also closely linked to the presence of hotspots. Hotspots are areas of intense volcanic activity that are not associated with plate boundaries. They are thought to be caused by mantle plumes, which can bring up hot, buoyant material from the lower mantle. This material can then rise to the surface and form OIBs.

The composition of OIBs can also provide valuable insights into the processes occurring at mid-ocean ridges. For example, the presence of HIMU components in OIBs can indicate the presence of mantle plumes at mid-ocean ridges, which can help to better understand the formation of MORBs.

In conclusion, OIBs are a diverse and complex type of igneous rock that is formed through the melting of the Earth's mantle. Their composition is influenced by the presence of mantle plumes and the mixing of different mantle components, and they can provide valuable insights into the processes occurring at mid-ocean ridges. 





### Subsection: 6.2a Granitoids

Granitoids are a group of coarse-grained, light-colored igneous rocks that are commonly found in the continents. They are formed through the crystallization of magma at high temperatures and pressures, and are often associated with other types of igneous rocks, such as gneisses and schists.

#### 6.2a Granitoids

Granitoids are classified based on their mineral composition and texture. The most common types of granitoids include granite, gneiss, and schist. These rocks are typically light-colored, with a coarse-grained texture, and are composed of minerals such as quartz, feldspar, and mica.

Granitoids are formed through the crystallization of magma at high temperatures and pressures. This magma is often derived from the melting of the Earth's mantle, but can also be formed through the melting of older igneous rocks. As the magma cools and solidifies, it forms a coarse-grained texture, with minerals such as quartz and feldspar crystallizing first, followed by mica.

The composition of granitoids can vary greatly, depending on the source of the magma and the conditions under which it crystallizes. Some granitoids are highly silica-rich, with high concentrations of minerals such as quartz and feldspar. Others may be more iron and magnesium-rich, with higher concentrations of minerals such as olivine and pyroxene.

Granitoids are important components of the Earth's continental crust, and their formation and evolution can provide valuable insights into the processes occurring at mid-ocean ridges. For example, the presence of granitoids in a particular region can indicate the presence of mantle plumes, which can bring up hot, buoyant material from the lower mantle. This material can then rise to the surface and form granitoids, providing a link between the processes occurring at mid-ocean ridges and those on the continents.

In addition to their role in understanding the Earth's crust, granitoids also have important economic implications. Many granitoids are highly resistant to weathering and erosion, making them ideal for use in construction materials such as granite and gneiss. They are also important sources of minerals such as feldspar and mica, which are used in a variety of industrial applications.

In conclusion, granitoids are a diverse and complex group of igneous rocks that play a crucial role in the Earth's continental crust. Their formation and evolution can provide valuable insights into the processes occurring at mid-ocean ridges, and their economic importance cannot be overlooked. 





### Subsection: 6.2b Volcanic arcs

Volcanic arcs are a type of igneous rock association that are commonly found in the continents. They are formed through the process of arc volcanism, which is characterized by the eruption of basaltic magmas onto the Earth's surface. Volcanic arcs are important components of the Earth's continental crust, and their formation and evolution can provide valuable insights into the processes occurring at mid-ocean ridges.

#### 6.2b Volcanic arcs

Volcanic arcs are formed through the process of arc volcanism, which is characterized by the eruption of basaltic magmas onto the Earth's surface. These magmas are derived from the melting of the Earth's mantle, and are often associated with the subduction of oceanic crust beneath continental crust. As the oceanic crust is subducted, it is heated and partially melted, forming a basaltic magma that is then transported towards the surface.

The composition of volcanic arcs can vary greatly, depending on the source of the magma and the conditions under which it crystallizes. Some volcanic arcs are highly silica-rich, with high concentrations of minerals such as quartz and feldspar. Others may be more iron and magnesium-rich, with higher concentrations of minerals such as olivine and pyroxene.

Volcanic arcs are important components of the Earth's continental crust, and their formation and evolution can provide valuable insights into the processes occurring at mid-ocean ridges. For example, the presence of volcanic arcs in a particular region can indicate the presence of mantle plumes, which can bring up hot, buoyant material from the lower mantle. This material can then rise to the surface and form volcanic arcs, providing a link between the processes occurring at mid-ocean ridges and those on the continents.

In addition to their role in understanding the Earth's crust, volcanic arcs also have important economic implications. Many of the world's largest and most productive gold deposits are found in volcanic arcs, particularly in the Andes Mountains of South America. These deposits are often associated with hydrothermal alteration, which is thought to be caused by the circulation of hot fluids through the surrounding rocks. The presence of volcanic arcs can therefore be an important indicator of potential gold deposits.

 7.1: Metamorphic Rocks

Metamorphic rocks are a fascinating and diverse group of rocks that have been studied extensively by geologists for centuries. They are formed through the process of metamorphism, which is the transformation of one rock type into another due to changes in temperature, pressure, and chemical reactions. In this section, we will explore the different types of metamorphic rocks, their formation processes, and their unique characteristics.

#### 7.1a: Metamorphic Facies

Metamorphic facies are the different types of metamorphic rocks that are formed under specific conditions of temperature, pressure, and chemical reactions. These facies are classified based on the mineral assemblages and textures that they exhibit. There are three main types of metamorphic facies: low-grade, high-grade, and ultra-high-grade.

Low-grade metamorphic facies are formed at relatively low temperatures and pressures, typically less than 500°C and 1 kbar. These facies are characterized by the preservation of the original rock's mineral assemblage and texture, with only minor changes. Examples of low-grade metamorphic facies include greenschist, chlorite schist, and albite-muscovite schist.

High-grade metamorphic facies are formed at higher temperatures and pressures, typically between 500°C and 800°C and 1-2 kbar. These facies are characterized by the recrystallization of the original rock's mineral assemblage, resulting in a more uniform texture. Examples of high-grade metamorphic facies include biotite gneiss, sillimanite gneiss, and kyanite gneiss.

Ultra-high-grade metamorphic facies are formed at extremely high temperatures and pressures, typically above 800°C and 2 kbar. These facies are characterized by the complete recrystallization of the original rock's mineral assemblage, resulting in a highly metamorphosed texture. Examples of ultra-high-grade metamorphic facies include omphacite gneiss, sillimanite gneiss, and kyanite gneiss.

The formation of metamorphic facies is influenced by a variety of factors, including the composition of the original rock, the temperature and pressure conditions, and the duration of the metamorphic process. These factors can result in the formation of different types of metamorphic rocks, each with its own unique characteristics.

#### 7.1b: Metamorphic Rocks

Metamorphic rocks are formed through the process of metamorphism, which is the transformation of one rock type into another due to changes in temperature, pressure, and chemical reactions. These rocks are classified based on their mineral assemblages and textures, and can be found in a variety of locations, from deep within the Earth's crust to the surface of mountains.

One type of metamorphic rock is the gneiss, which is a high-grade metamorphic rock characterized by its banded texture and mineral assemblage. Gneisses are commonly found in the upper levels of the Earth's crust, and are often used in construction due to their strength and durability.

Another type of metamorphic rock is the schist, which is a low-grade metamorphic rock characterized by its foliated texture and mineral assemblage. Schists are commonly found in the lower levels of the Earth's crust, and are often used in the production of building materials such as bricks and tiles.

Metamorphic rocks play a crucial role in the Earth's history and have been studied extensively by geologists. They provide valuable insights into the processes that shape our planet, and their unique characteristics make them a fascinating subject of study for advanced petrology students.

### Subsection: 6.3a Continental flood basalts

Continental flood basalts (CFBs) are a type of igneous rock association that are commonly found in the continents. They are formed through the process of flood volcanism, which is characterized by the eruption of large volumes of basaltic magmas onto the Earth's surface. CFBs are important components of the Earth's continental crust, and their formation and evolution can provide valuable insights into the processes occurring at mid-ocean ridges.

#### 6.3a Continental flood basalts

Continental flood basalts are formed through the process of flood volcanism, which is characterized by the eruption of large volumes of basaltic magmas onto the Earth's surface. These magmas are derived from the melting of the Earth's mantle, and are often associated with the formation of large igneous provinces (LIPs). As the mantle plume rises towards the surface, it can cause the melting of the Earth's crust, leading to the formation of basaltic magmas. These magmas then erupt onto the surface, forming extensive lava flows that can cover large areas of the continents.

The composition of CFBs can vary greatly, depending on the source of the magma and the conditions under which it crystallizes. Some CFBs are highly silica-rich, with high concentrations of minerals such as quartz and feldspar. Others may be more iron and magnesium-rich, with higher concentrations of minerals such as olivine and pyroxene. The composition of CFBs can also be influenced by the presence of volatiles, which can significantly alter the melting behavior of the mantle and the composition of the resulting magmas.

CFBs are important components of the Earth's continental crust, and their formation and evolution can provide valuable insights into the processes occurring at mid-ocean ridges. For example, the presence of CFBs can indicate the presence of mantle plumes, which can bring up hot, buoyant material from the lower mantle. This material can then rise to the surface and form volcanic arcs, providing a link between the processes occurring at mid-ocean ridges and those on the continents.

In addition to their role in understanding the Earth's crust, CFBs also have important economic implications. Many of the world's largest and most productive gold deposits are associated with CFBs, highlighting the potential for these igneous rock associations to yield valuable mineral resources. 





### Subsection: 6.3b Layered mafic intrusions

Layered mafic intrusions are another important component of large igneous provinces (LIPs). These intrusions are formed when basaltic magmas are injected into the Earth's crust, creating layers of different minerals and compositions. The layers can range from a few meters to several kilometers in thickness, and can be composed of a variety of minerals, including olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase feldspar.

#### 6.3b Layered mafic intrusions

Layered mafic intrusions are formed when basaltic magmas are injected into the Earth's crust. These magmas can originate from a variety of sources, including mantle plumes, mid-ocean ridges, and hotspots. As the magmas rise towards the surface, they can interact with the surrounding crust, leading to the formation of different layers with varying mineral compositions.

The formation of layered mafic intrusions can provide valuable insights into the processes occurring at mid-ocean ridges. For example, the presence of olivine-rich layers can indicate the presence of a mantle plume, while the presence of plagioclase feldspar can suggest the involvement of crustal melting. Additionally, the thickness and composition of the layers can provide information about the rate and duration of magma injection, as well as the source of the magma.

Layered mafic intrusions are also important for understanding the evolution of the Earth's continental crust. As the layers cool and solidify, they can undergo metamorphism, leading to the formation of new minerals and the redistribution of elements. This process can provide insights into the composition and evolution of the Earth's early crust, as well as the role of magmatic processes in shaping the continents.

In conclusion, layered mafic intrusions are an important component of large igneous provinces and can provide valuable insights into the processes occurring at mid-ocean ridges. Their study is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of the Earth's continental crust, and their presence can be used as a marker for the presence of mantle plumes and other geological features. 





### Subsection: 6.4a Lunar basalts

Lunar basalts are a type of igneous rock found on the Moon. They are formed from the cooling and solidification of basaltic magma, which is a type of mafic (dark-colored) magma. Basaltic magma is commonly found on the Moon due to its high iron and magnesium content, which is a result of the Moon's high iron and magnesium abundance.

#### 6.4a Lunar basalts

Lunar basalts are classified into three main series based on their major element chemistry: high-Ti basalts, low-Ti basalts, and very-low-Ti (VLT) basalts. These series are further divided into subgroups based on their minor and trace element chemistry. The high-Ti basalts, for example, are further divided into the "high-Ti" and "low-Ti" subgroups.

The composition of lunar basalts is highly variable, with some samples showing a high concentration of titanium (TiO<sub>2</sub>) up to 15 wt.%. This is in contrast to terrestrial basalts, which typically have TiO<sub>2</sub> concentrations less than 4 wt.%. The high concentration of titanium in lunar basalts is thought to be a result of the Moon's high iron and magnesium abundance.

One of the most unique types of lunar basalts is the KREEP basalts. KREEP stands for "potassium, rare-earth elements, and phosphorus," and these basalts are abnormally rich in these elements. This is thought to be a result of the Moon's early history, when the Moon's mantle was still molten and these elements were able to concentrate in the basaltic magma.

The study of lunar basalts is crucial for understanding the Moon's geologic evolution. By analyzing the composition and structure of these rocks, scientists can gain insights into the processes that shaped the Moon's surface and interior. Additionally, the study of lunar basalts can also provide valuable information about the Moon's early history and the conditions that existed during its formation.

In the next section, we will explore another type of extraterrestrial igneous rock - Martian basalts.


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the various types of igneous rock associations found on Earth. We have learned about the different processes that contribute to the formation of these associations, such as fractional melting, magma mixing, and crystal settling. We have also discussed the importance of understanding these associations in order to decipher the history of the Earth's crust and mantle.

One of the key takeaways from this chapter is the concept of fractional melting. This process plays a crucial role in the formation of igneous rock associations, as it allows for the separation of different minerals and elements based on their melting points. This results in the formation of different types of igneous rocks, each with its own unique composition and characteristics.

Another important aspect of igneous rock associations is magma mixing. This process occurs when two or more magmas of different compositions interact with each other, resulting in the formation of a new magma with a unique composition. This can lead to the formation of complex igneous rock associations, with a variety of different minerals and elements present.

Finally, we have discussed the role of crystal settling in the formation of igneous rock associations. This process occurs when minerals with different densities settle at different rates, resulting in the formation of layers of different minerals within a single igneous rock. This can provide valuable insights into the conditions and processes that were present during the formation of the rock.

In conclusion, the study of igneous rock associations is crucial for understanding the history and evolution of the Earth's crust and mantle. By studying the different types of igneous rocks and their associations, we can gain a deeper understanding of the processes that shape our planet.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of igneous rocks and tectonics. Igneous rocks are formed through the cooling and solidification of molten rock, or magma, and they play a crucial role in shaping the Earth's crust. Tectonics, on the other hand, is the study of the movement and deformation of the Earth's crust, which is largely influenced by the presence and behavior of igneous rocks.

We will begin by exploring the different types of igneous rocks, their formation processes, and their unique characteristics. We will then move on to discuss the role of igneous rocks in tectonic processes, such as plate movements and volcanic activity. We will also examine how the study of igneous rocks can provide insights into the history of the Earth's crust and the forces that have shaped it over time.

Throughout this chapter, we will use mathematical expressions and equations to explain complex concepts and processes. For example, we might use the equation `$\Delta w = ...$` to represent the change in a variable `$w$` over time. We will also use the popular Markdown format to present our content, allowing for easy navigation and readability.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between igneous rocks and tectonics, and how they contribute to the dynamic nature of our planet. So, let's embark on this exciting journey together, exploring the intricate world of igneous rocks and tectonics.




### Subsection: 7.1a Mid-ocean ridges and seafloor spreading

Mid-ocean ridges are underwater mountain ranges that form the backbone of the world's ocean basins. They are sites of intense igneous activity and are a key component of the Earth's tectonic system. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge, for instance, is a mid-ocean ridge that stretches from the Arctic Ocean to the tip of Africa. It is a divergent plate boundary where the North American and Eurasian Plates are pulling apart.

#### Morphology of Mid-ocean ridges

The morphology of mid-ocean ridges is largely influenced by the process of seafloor spreading. At the spreading center of a mid-ocean ridge, the depth of the seafloor is approximately 2,000 meters. As one moves away from the spreading center, the depth of the seafloor increases, correlating with the age of the lithosphere. This depth-age relation can be modeled by the cooling of a lithosphere plate or by Pratt isostacy.

Pratt isostacy proposes that close to the ridge axis, there is a hot, low-density mantle supporting the oceanic crust. As the oceanic plate cools, away from the ridge axis, the oceanic mantle lithosphere thickens, and the density increases. Thus, older seafloor is underlain by denser material and is deeper.

#### Spreading Rate of Mid-ocean ridges

The spreading rate of a mid-ocean ridge is the rate at which an ocean basin widens due to seafloor spreading. This rate can be computed by mapping marine magnetic anomalies that span mid-ocean ridges. As crystallized basalt extruded at a ridge axis cools below Curie points of appropriate iron-titanium oxides, magnetic field directions parallel to the Earth's magnetic field are recorded in those oxides. The orientations of the field preserved in the oceanic crust comprise a record of directions of the Earth's magnetic field with time. Because the field has reversed directions at known intervals throughout its history, the pattern of geomagnetic reversals in the ocean crust can be used as an indicator of age; given the crustal age and distance from the ridge axis, spreading rates can be calculated.

Spreading rates range from approximately 10–200 mm/yr. Slow-spreading ridges such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge have spread much less far (showing a steeper profile) than faster ridges such as the East Pacific Rise.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the igneous processes that occur at mid-ocean ridges and how they contribute to the formation of igneous rocks.




### Subsection: 7.1b Subduction zones and volcanic arcs

Subduction zones are another key component of the Earth's tectonic system. They are sites of intense igneous activity and are a result of one tectonic plate being forced beneath another plate at a convergent plate boundary. The Pacific Ring of Fire, for instance, is a series of volcanic arcs that form the result of subduction zones.

#### Morphology of Subduction Zones

The morphology of subduction zones is largely influenced by the process of subduction. At the trench of a subduction zone, the depth of the seafloor is approximately 2,000 meters. As one moves away from the trench, the depth of the seafloor increases, correlating with the age of the lithosphere. This depth-age relation can be modeled by the cooling of a lithosphere plate or by Pratt isostacy.

Pratt isostacy proposes that close to the trench, there is a hot, low-density mantle supporting the oceanic crust. As the oceanic plate cools, away from the trench, the oceanic mantle lithosphere thickens, and the density increases. Thus, older seafloor is underlain by denser material and is deeper.

#### Volcanic Arcs

Volcanic arcs are a series of volcanoes that form along the edge of a continent or an ocean basin. They are a result of subduction zones and are a key component of the Earth's tectonic system. The Izu–Bonin–Mariana Arc, for instance, is a volcanic arc that forms the result of the Pacific Plate being forced beneath the Philippine Plate.

##### Arc Volcanism

Arc volcanism is a type of volcanism that occurs along the edge of a continent or an ocean basin. It is a result of subduction zones and is characterized by the formation of volcanic edifices. The Izu–Bonin–Mariana Arc, for instance, has been identified to have 76 volcanic edifices along 1370 km of the Mariana arc, grouped into 60 "volcanic centers", of which at least 26 (20 submarine) are hydrothermally or volcanically active. The overall volcanic center density is 4.4/100 km of arc, and that of active centers is 1.9/100 km.

##### Arc Hydrothermal Activity

Hydrothermal activity is a key component of arc volcanism. It is a result of the interaction between hot magma and seawater, which can lead to the formation of hydrothermal vents. These vents can support unique ecosystems and can also contribute to the overall hydrothermal emissions from the Earth's oceans. The Izu–Bonin–Mariana Arc, for instance, has been estimated to contribute hydrothermal emissions equal to ~10% of that from the global mid-ocean ridge system.

### Conclusion

### Subsection: 7.2a Intraplate volcanism

Intraplate volcanism is a type of volcanism that occurs within the interior of a tectonic plate, away from plate boundaries. This type of volcanism is often associated with hotspots and mantle plumes, which are regions of intense heat and convection within the Earth's mantle.

#### Hotspots and Mantle Plumes

Hotspots are regions of the Earth's surface where volcanic activity is significantly higher than the surrounding areas. They are often associated with mantle plumes, which are vertical columns of hot, buoyant material that rise from the core-mantle boundary to the Earth's surface. The Hawaiian Islands and the Yellowstone Caldera are examples of hotspots associated with mantle plumes.

The Hawaiian Islands, for instance, are a chain of volcanic islands formed by a mantle plume. The Hawaiian-Emperor volcanic system is notoriously difficult to study due to its remote location and the lack of accurate age variations in the lithosphere. However, observations suggest that the volcanoes in this system are local thermal features, indicating the presence of a mantle plume.

#### Intraplate Volcanism and Plate Tectonics

Intraplate volcanism plays a crucial role in plate tectonics. The movement of tectonic plates is driven by convection currents in the mantle, which are influenced by the heat generated by the Earth's core and the heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements. Intraplate volcanism, particularly hotspots and mantle plumes, can significantly influence these convection currents, leading to changes in plate movement and the formation of new landforms.

For example, the Hawaiian Islands are a chain of volcanic islands formed by a mantle plume. As the Pacific Plate moves over the hotspot, a new volcano is formed, and the older volcanoes are subducted. This process has been ongoing for millions of years, resulting in the formation of the Hawaiian Islands as we know them today.

#### Intraplate Volcanism and the Earth's Surface

Intraplate volcanism can also have a significant impact on the Earth's surface. The Hawaiian Islands, for instance, are a chain of volcanic islands formed by a mantle plume. The volcanic activity in this region has resulted in the formation of a variety of landforms, including volcanic cones, calderas, and lava flows. These landforms not only provide valuable insights into the processes of volcanism and plate tectonics but also contribute to the unique and diverse ecosystems found on the Hawaiian Islands.

In conclusion, intraplate volcanism, particularly hotspots and mantle plumes, plays a crucial role in shaping the Earth's surface and influencing plate tectonics. The study of these phenomena is essential for understanding the complex processes that shape our planet.




### Subsection: 7.2b Mantle plume theory

The mantle plume theory is a hypothesis that explains the formation of hotspots and intraplate volcanism. It proposes that mantle plumes, which are columns of hot, buoyant material, rise from the core-mantle boundary to the Earth's surface. These plumes can cause volcanic activity and the formation of hotspots, such as the Hawaiian Islands and the Yellowstone Caldera.

#### The Role of Mantle Plumes in Intraplate Volcanism

Mantle plumes play a crucial role in intraplate volcanism. As these plumes rise from the core-mantle boundary, they can cause volcanic activity and the formation of hotspots. The Hawaiian Islands, for instance, are a chain of volcanic islands formed by a mantle plume. As the Pacific Plate moves over the hotspot, a new volcano is formed, and the older volcanoes are subducted. This process has been ongoing for millions of years, resulting in the formation of the Hawaiian Islands as we know them today.

#### The Paradox of Hotspots and Mantle Plumes

The mantle plume theory has been a subject of debate since its inception. One of the main challenges is the paradox of hotspots and mantle plumes. The observations suggest that a broad plume with a relatively low temperature anomaly is in better agreement with the observed crustal thickness, topography, and gravity than a thin, hot plume. However, the seismological and geochemical observations suggest a thin, hot plume.

To resolve this paradox, several attempts have been made to explain the observations with numerical geodynamical models of mantle convection. These models prefer a plume that is 180–200 °C hotter than the surrounding mantle and has a stem with a radius of ca. 100 km. Such temperatures have not yet been confirmed by petrology, however.

#### The Role of Mantle Plumes in Plate Tectonics

Mantle plumes also play a significant role in plate tectonics. The movement of tectonic plates is driven by convection currents in the mantle, which are influenced by the heat generated by the Earth's core and the heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements. Mantle plumes can significantly influence these convection currents, leading to changes in plate movement and the formation of new landforms.

For example, the Hawaiian Islands are a chain of volcanic islands formed by a mantle plume. As the Pacific Plate moves over the hotspot, a new volcano is formed, and the older volcanoes are subducted. This process has been ongoing for millions of years, resulting in the formation of the Hawaiian Islands as we know them today.

#### The Role of Mantle Plumes in the Earth's Interior

Mantle plumes also play a crucial role in the Earth's interior. They can cause convection currents in the mantle, which can influence the movement of tectonic plates. They can also cause volcanic activity and the formation of hotspots, such as the Hawaiian Islands and the Yellowstone Caldera.

Furthermore, mantle plumes can also cause changes in the Earth's magnetic field. As they rise from the core-mantle boundary, they can interact with the Earth's magnetic field, causing changes in its strength and direction. This interaction can provide valuable insights into the Earth's interior and its evolution over time.

In conclusion, mantle plumes play a crucial role in intraplate volcanism, plate tectonics, and the Earth's interior. While there are still many unanswered questions and ongoing debates, the mantle plume theory continues to be a fundamental concept in the study of igneous petrology and geodynamics.

## Chapter 8: Volcanic Processes

### Introduction

Volcanic processes are a fascinating and complex aspect of igneous petrology. They are responsible for the creation of some of the most visually stunning and geologically significant features on Earth, from towering volcanoes to vast lava fields. This chapter will delve into the intricate world of volcanic processes, exploring the mechanisms behind volcanic eruptions, the formation of different types of volcanic rocks, and the role of volcanism in shaping the Earth's surface.

Volcanic processes are governed by a complex interplay of physical, chemical, and geological factors. They involve the movement of molten rock (magma) through the Earth's crust, its interaction with the surrounding rocks, and its eventual eruption at the surface. The composition of the magma, the pressure and temperature conditions it experiences, and the structure of the crust all play a crucial role in determining the nature of the volcanic processes and the resulting volcanic rocks.

In this chapter, we will explore the different types of volcanic eruptions, from explosive Plinian eruptions to effusive Hawaiian eruptions, and the factors that influence their intensity and type. We will also delve into the formation of different types of volcanic rocks, including basalt, andesite, and rhyolite, and the processes that govern their composition and texture.

We will also discuss the role of volcanism in shaping the Earth's surface. Volcanic activity can have profound impacts on the environment, influencing climate, altering landscapes, and even driving evolutionary changes in species. Understanding these processes is not only fascinating from a scientific perspective, but also crucial for predicting and managing the impacts of volcanic activity.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of volcanic processes, combining theoretical explanations with practical examples and case studies. It is designed to be accessible to advanced undergraduate students, while also providing a solid foundation for further study in the field of igneous petrology. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or simply a curious reader, we hope that this chapter will deepen your understanding and appreciation of the fascinating world of volcanic processes.




### Section: 7.3 Rifting and Continental Breakup:

#### 7.3a Rift-related volcanism

Rift-related volcanism is a type of volcanism that occurs along the boundaries of tectonic plates, particularly in areas of plate divergence. This type of volcanism is characterized by the formation of mid-ocean ridges, oceanic islands, and continental rifts. The study of rift-related volcanism is crucial for understanding the processes that drive plate tectonics and the evolution of the Earth's crust.

#### 7.3a.1 Mid-ocean ridges

Mid-ocean ridges are underwater mountain ranges that form along the boundaries of tectonic plates. They are sites of intense volcanic activity and are responsible for the formation of new oceanic crust. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge, for instance, is a mid-ocean ridge that extends from the Arctic Ocean to the tip of South America. It is a site of ongoing seafloor spreading and is responsible for the formation of new oceanic crust at a rate of about 2.5 cm per year.

The volcanism associated with mid-ocean ridges is primarily basaltic in nature. Basalt is a common igneous rock that is formed from the cooling and solidification of molten rock, or magma. The composition of basalt is typically high in iron and magnesium and low in silica, giving it a dark color and fine-grained texture. The volcanism associated with mid-ocean ridges is characterized by the extrusion of basaltic lava flows, which can form large shield volcanoes.

#### 7.3a.2 Oceanic Islands

Oceanic islands are another type of feature associated with rift-related volcanism. These islands are formed when a hotspot in the mantle causes the melting of the oceanic crust, leading to the formation of new land. The Hawaiian Islands, for instance, are a chain of volcanic islands formed by a mantle plume. As the Pacific Plate moves over the hotspot, a new volcano is formed, and the older volcanoes are subducted. This process has been ongoing for millions of years, resulting in the formation of the Hawaiian Islands as we know them today.

The volcanism associated with oceanic islands is also primarily basaltic in nature. However, the composition of the basalt can vary depending on the composition of the mantle beneath the hotspot. For instance, the basalt of the Hawaiian Islands is enriched in iron and magnesium, reflecting the composition of the mantle plume beneath the islands.

#### 7.3a.3 Continental Rifts

Continental rifts are another type of feature associated with rift-related volcanism. These are linear depressions in the Earth's crust that are typically found in areas of plate divergence. The Great Rift Valley in East Africa is a well-known example of a continental rift. The volcanism associated with continental rifts is typically more complex than that of mid-ocean ridges or oceanic islands. This is because the composition of the mantle beneath continental rifts can vary significantly, leading to the formation of a variety of igneous rocks.

In the next section, we will explore the role of mantle plumes in rift-related volcanism and their implications for plate tectonics.

#### 7.3a.4 Volcanic Activity in the Afar Triple Junction

The Afar Triple Junction, located in the Afar Region of Ethiopia, is a site of intense volcanic activity due to its position at the intersection of three tectonic plates: the Arabian Plate, the Somali Plate, and the Nubian Plate. The Afar Depression, a large, desolate basin in the Afar Region, is a result of the triple junction and is one of the lowest points on Earth.

The volcanism associated with the Afar Triple Junction is primarily basaltic in nature, similar to that found in mid-ocean ridges and oceanic islands. However, the composition of the basalt can vary significantly due to the complex interplay of the three tectonic plates. This results in the formation of a variety of igneous rocks, including basalt, gabbro, and diorite.

The Afar Triple Junction is also a site of significant geothermal activity. The Dabbahu volcano, located in the Afar Depression, is one of the most active volcanoes in the world, with frequent eruptions and high levels of geothermal activity. The volcanism and geothermal activity in the Afar Triple Junction are still ongoing, providing valuable insights into the processes that drive plate tectonics and the evolution of the Earth's crust.

#### 7.3a.5 Implications of Volcanism in the Afar Triple Junction

The volcanism and geothermal activity in the Afar Triple Junction have significant implications for our understanding of plate tectonics and the Earth's crust. The Afar Triple Junction is a site of intense crustal extension, with the Afar Depression being one of the largest and deepest rifts on Earth. This extension is driven by the relative movement of the three tectonic plates, with the Nubian Plate being pulled apart by the Somali Plate and the Arabian Plate.

The volcanism associated with the Afar Triple Junction provides valuable insights into the processes that drive plate tectonics. The frequent eruptions and high levels of geothermal activity at the Dabbahu volcano, for instance, suggest that the Afar Triple Junction is a site of significant mantle upwelling. This upwelling is likely driven by the triple junction itself, with the three tectonic plates creating a triple point of mantle upwelling.

The composition of the volcanic rocks found in the Afar Triple Junction also provides valuable insights into the composition of the mantle beneath the triple junction. The basalt, gabbro, and diorite found in the Afar Depression suggest that the mantle beneath the triple junction is enriched in iron and magnesium, with lower levels of silica. This composition is similar to that found in mid-ocean ridges and oceanic islands, further supporting the idea of mantle upwelling at the Afar Triple Junction.

In conclusion, the volcanism and geothermal activity in the Afar Triple Junction provide valuable insights into the processes that drive plate tectonics and the evolution of the Earth's crust. The Afar Triple Junction is a site of intense crustal extension, with the Afar Depression being one of the largest and deepest rifts on Earth. The volcanism associated with the Afar Triple Junction is primarily basaltic in nature, with the composition of the basalt providing insights into the composition of the mantle beneath the triple junction.

#### 7.3b Seafloor spreading

Seafloor spreading is a fundamental process in plate tectonics that occurs at mid-ocean ridges. It is a result of the movement of tectonic plates, which are large sections of the Earth's lithosphere that float on the asthenosphere. The movement of these plates is driven by convection currents in the mantle, which is the layer of hot, semi-fluid rock beneath the lithosphere.

At mid-ocean ridges, where the lithosphere is thin and the asthenosphere is hot, the lithosphere can be pulled apart. This process is known as seafloor spreading. As the lithosphere separates, new crust is formed at the mid-ocean ridge. This new crust is formed by the cooling and solidification of molten rock, or magma, which is derived from the mantle.

The process of seafloor spreading can be visualized as a conveyor belt. As the lithosphere moves away from the mid-ocean ridge, it cools and becomes denser. This denser lithosphere sinks back into the mantle at a subduction zone, which is a site of convergence where one tectonic plate is forced beneath another. The process then repeats, with new crust being formed at the mid-ocean ridge and old crust being destroyed at the subduction zone.

The rate of seafloor spreading can be determined by measuring the age of the oceanic crust. This is typically done by analyzing the radiometric age of the rocks, which can be done using techniques such as potassium-argon dating or rubidium-strontium dating. The age of the oceanic crust can also be determined by measuring the magnetic properties of the rocks. The Earth's magnetic field changes over time, and these changes can be recorded in the magnetization of the rocks. By measuring the magnetic properties of the rocks, scientists can determine the age of the oceanic crust.

The process of seafloor spreading is a key mechanism in plate tectonics. It is responsible for the formation of new oceanic crust and the destruction of old crust. This process also plays a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, as it is responsible for the sequestration of carbon dioxide in the oceanic crust. Understanding the process of seafloor spreading is therefore crucial for understanding the dynamics of the Earth's lithosphere and the role of plate tectonics in the evolution of the Earth's crust.

#### 7.3c Continental breakup

Continental breakup is a process that occurs when a continent is pulled apart by tectonic forces. This process is often associated with the formation of mid-ocean ridges and the creation of new oceanic crust. The breakup of a continent can be a complex process, involving a combination of plate movements, volcanic activity, and the formation of new landforms.

The breakup of a continent can be initiated by a variety of mechanisms. For example, the movement of hotspots, such as the Hawaiian hotspot, can cause a continent to split apart. The movement of these hotspots is driven by convection currents in the mantle, which can cause the lithosphere to stretch and thin. As the lithosphere thins, it can break apart, leading to the formation of a mid-ocean ridge.

The breakup of a continent can also be driven by the movement of other tectonic plates. For example, the movement of the Pacific Plate can cause the breakup of the North American continent. As the Pacific Plate moves northward, it can cause the lithosphere beneath North America to stretch and thin. This stretching and thinning can lead to the formation of a mid-ocean ridge, marking the boundary between the North American and Pacific plates.

The breakup of a continent can have significant implications for the Earth's climate. For example, the breakup of the supercontinent Pangea, which occurred about 200 million years ago, led to a significant increase in the Earth's surface area. This increase in surface area led to an increase in the Earth's albedo, or reflectivity, which in turn led to a cooling of the Earth's climate.

The breakup of a continent can also lead to the formation of new landforms. For example, the breakup of the North American continent led to the formation of the Great Rift Valley in East Africa. This valley is a result of the separation of the North American and African plates, which caused the lithosphere beneath East Africa to stretch and thin. This stretching and thinning led to the formation of a mid-ocean ridge, which is now exposed on land as the Great Rift Valley.

In conclusion, the breakup of a continent is a complex process that involves a combination of plate movements, volcanic activity, and the formation of new landforms. This process can have significant implications for the Earth's climate and the formation of new landforms. Understanding the process of continental breakup is therefore crucial for understanding the dynamics of the Earth's lithosphere and the role of plate tectonics in the evolution of the Earth's crust.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the fascinating world of rift-related volcanism and its implications for plate tectonics. We have seen how the movement of tectonic plates can lead to the formation of rifts, which in turn can result in volcanic activity. This process is not only important for understanding the Earth's interior dynamics, but also plays a crucial role in shaping the Earth's surface and its evolution over time.

We have also delved into the various types of volcanic activity that can occur in the context of rift-related volcanism, including the formation of basaltic lava flows, the extrusion of sills and dikes, and the eruption of silicic magmas. Each of these processes has its own unique characteristics and implications, and together they provide a comprehensive picture of the complex interplay between volcanism and plate tectonics.

Finally, we have discussed the role of mantle plumes in rift-related volcanism, and how these plumes can contribute to the formation of hotspots and the generation of heat in the Earth's interior. This discussion has highlighted the importance of mantle plumes in the broader context of plate tectonics, and has underscored the need for further research in this area.

In conclusion, the study of rift-related volcanism is a rich and rewarding field that offers many opportunities for further exploration and discovery. It is our hope that this chapter has provided you with a solid foundation upon which to build your understanding of this fascinating topic.

## Chapter 8: Igneous Petrology

### Introduction

Welcome to Chapter 8: Igneous Petrology. This chapter delves into the fascinating world of igneous rocks, their formation, and the processes that shape them. Igneous petrology is a critical field of study in geology, as it provides insights into the Earth's interior dynamics and the forces that drive plate tectonics.

Igneous rocks are formed from the solidification of molten rock, or magma, which is generated by various processes within the Earth. The study of these rocks, known as petrology, is a crucial aspect of understanding the Earth's composition and evolution. This chapter will provide a comprehensive overview of the principles and techniques used in the study of igneous rocks.

We will explore the different types of igneous rocks, including their mineral composition, texture, and structure. We will also discuss the processes that govern their formation, such as crystallization, cooling, and solidification. Additionally, we will delve into the role of igneous rocks in the Earth's history, particularly in the context of plate tectonics.

This chapter will also touch on the importance of igneous petrology in various fields, including mineral exploration, environmental science, and geothermal energy. We will discuss how the principles and techniques of igneous petrology are applied in these fields, and how they contribute to our understanding of the Earth's processes.

In the realm of igneous petrology, the MIT community has made significant contributions. For instance, MIT researchers have been instrumental in the development of techniques for the analysis of igneous rocks, such as electron microprobe analysis and laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. These techniques have greatly enhanced our ability to study the composition and evolution of igneous rocks.

As we journey through this chapter, we will also touch on the latest advancements in the field, such as the use of advanced imaging techniques for the study of igneous rocks. These techniques, including scanning electron microscopy and cathodoluminescence, have revolutionized the study of igneous petrology, allowing for a more detailed and nuanced understanding of these rocks.

In conclusion, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of igneous petrology, from the formation of igneous rocks to their role in the Earth's history and current applications. Whether you are a seasoned geologist or a curious student, we hope that this chapter will deepen your understanding of the fascinating world of igneous rocks.




### Section: 7.3b Continental flood basalts and breakup

Continental flood basalts (CFBs) are a type of volcanic rock that is formed when large volumes of basaltic magma flood over the Earth's continents. These events are often associated with the breakup of continents and the formation of new oceanic crust. The Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG) in North America is a well-studied example of a CFB province.

#### 7.3b.1 Columbia River Basalt Group

The Columbia River Basalt Group (CRBG) is a large igneous province (LIP) that formed in the mid-Miocene, approximately 17.5 million years ago. Prior to this time, the Western Cascade stratovolcanoes erupted with periodic regularity for over 20 million years. However, an abrupt transition to shield volcanic flooding took place, marking the onset of the CRBG.

The CRBG can be divided into four major categories: The Steens Basalt, Grande Ronde Basalt, the Wanapum Basalt, and the Saddle Mountains Basalt. The various lava flows have been dated by radiometric dating, particularly through measurement of the ratios of isotopes of potassium to argon. The Columbia River flood basalt province comprises more than 300 individual basalt lava flows that have an average volume of .

The transition to flood volcanism in the CRBG, similar to other large igneous provinces, was also marked by atmospheric loading through the mass exsolution and emission of volatiles, via the process of volcanic degassing. Comparative analysis of volatile concentrations in source feeder dikes to associated extruded flow units have been quantitatively measured to determine the magnitude of degassing exhibited in CRBG eruptions. Of the more than 300 individual flows associated with the CRBG, the Roza flow contains some of the most well chemically preserved basalts for volatile analysis. Contained within the Wanapum formation, Roza is one of the most extensive members of the CRBG with an area of 40,300 square kilometres and a volume of 1,300 cubic kilometres. With magmatic volatile values assumed at 1 - 1.5 percent by weight concentration for source feeder dikes, the emission of sulphur for the Roza flow is calculated to be on the order of 12Gt (12,000 million tonnes) at a rate of 1.2Gt (1,200 million tonnes) annually, in the form of sulphur dioxide. However, other research through petrologic analysis has yielded SO2 mass degassing values at 0.12% - 0.28% of the total erupted mass of the magma, translating to lower emission estimates in the range of 1.8 - 4.5 Gt (1.8 - 4.5 billion tonnes) of sulphur.

#### 7.3b.2 Continental Breakup and the CRBG

The formation of the CRBG is closely linked to the breakup of the North American continent. The breakup of continents is a complex process that involves the separation of landmasses due to plate tectonics. In the case of the North American continent, the breakup was marked by the formation of the CRBG, which is believed to have been caused by the melting of the mantle beneath the continent.

The CRBG is a prime example of how volcanic activity can be used to study the breakup of continents. The timing and location of the CRBG eruptions provide valuable insights into the processes that led to the breakup of the North American continent. Furthermore, the chemical and isotopic composition of the CRBG rocks can provide information about the composition of the mantle beneath the continent, which can also shed light on the processes involved in continental breakup.

In conclusion, the study of continental flood basalts, such as the CRBG, is crucial for understanding the complex processes involved in the breakup of continents. These events have far-reaching implications for the Earth's crust and mantle, and their study can provide valuable insights into the dynamics of plate tectonics.

We have seen how the study of these rocks can help us understand the history of the Earth's crust and the ongoing processes that shape our planet.

In addition, we have explored the concept of plate boundaries and how they interact with igneous processes. We have learned that the majority of volcanic activity occurs at these boundaries, and that the type of volcanism seen at these locations can provide clues about the nature of the plate boundaries.

Overall, the study of igneous rocks and tectonics is a complex and multifaceted field, requiring a deep understanding of geology, chemistry, and physics.

## Chapter 8: Plate Tectonics and Volcanism

### Introduction

The study of igneous petrology is a fascinating journey into the heart of the Earth, exploring the processes that shape our planet's crust and mantle. In this chapter, we delve deeper into the intricate relationship between plate tectonics and volcanism, two fundamental concepts in the field of geology. 

Plate tectonics is a theory that describes the large-scale motion of the Earth's lithosphere. It is a theory that has revolutionized our understanding of the Earth's structure and dynamics. The theory posits that the Earth's lithosphere, which includes the crust and the uppermost mantle, is divided into several large and small plates that float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere. These plates move relative to each other, driven by the heat flow from the Earth's interior. This movement is responsible for many of the Earth's geological features, including mountain building, ocean floor spreading, and volcanic activity.

Volcanism, on the other hand, is a process that involves the eruption of molten rock, or magma, from the Earth's interior. This process is closely linked to plate tectonics, as volcanic activity is often associated with plate boundaries. The composition and behavior of volcanic eruptions can provide valuable insights into the processes occurring beneath the Earth's crust.

In this chapter, we will explore the interplay between plate tectonics and volcanism, examining how these processes shape the Earth's surface and influence its evolution. We will also delve into the role of igneous petrology in understanding these phenomena, focusing on the composition and behavior of volcanic rocks and their implications for our understanding of the Earth's dynamics.

As we journey through this chapter, we will use mathematical expressions, rendered using the TeX and LaTeX style syntax, to explain and illustrate these concepts. For example, we might write inline math like `$y_j(n)$` and equations like `$$
