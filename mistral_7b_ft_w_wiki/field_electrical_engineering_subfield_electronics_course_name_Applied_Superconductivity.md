### Section: 1.1 Perfect Conductivity:

Superconductivity is a phenomenon that has been studied for over a century, and it has led to the development of many advanced technologies. In this section, we will explore the concept of perfect conductivity, which is a fundamental aspect of superconductivity.

#### 1.1a Introduction to superconductivity

Superconductivity is a state of matter where certain materials exhibit zero electrical resistance and perfect diamagnetism when cooled below a critical temperature. This critical temperature, known as the transition temperature, is different for each superconducting material and is typically very low, often requiring extremely cold temperatures to achieve.

The concept of perfect conductivity is closely related to the Meissner effect, which is one of the key characteristics of superconductivity. The Meissner effect is the expulsion of magnetic fields from the interior of a superconductor, resulting in perfect diamagnetism. This effect is a direct consequence of the London equations, which describe the behavior of superconductors.

The London equations are a set of two equations that describe the behavior of superconductors. They were first derived by Norwegian physicist Ronne-Brenn in 1933 and are named after British physicist Michael T. R. James and Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, who first observed the Meissner effect in 1933. The equations are given by:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{J}}{\partial t} = -\frac{n_s e^2}{m} \mathbf{A} - \frac{n_s e^2}{m} \frac{\partial \mathbf{A}}{\partial t}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} = \nabla \times \mathbf{E}
$$

where $\mathbf{J}$ is the current density, $n_s$ is the superfluid density, $e$ is the elementary charge, $m$ is the mass of the electron, $\mathbf{A}$ is the vector potential, and $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field.

The London equations describe the behavior of superconductors in the Meissner state, where the material is in perfect conductivity and exhibits perfect diamagnetism. In this state, the superconductor expels all magnetic fields from its interior, resulting in zero resistance to electrical current flow. This is in contrast to normal conductors, where magnetic fields can penetrate the material and cause resistance to current flow.

The concept of perfect conductivity is crucial in understanding the behavior of superconductors. It is also essential in the development of superconducting technologies, such as superconducting magnets and power transmission lines. In the next section, we will explore the different types of superconductors and their properties.





### Section: 1.1b Meissner effect

The Meissner effect is a fundamental phenomenon in superconductivity that describes the expulsion of magnetic fields from the interior of a superconductor. This effect was first observed by British physicist Michael T. R. James and Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes in 1933, and it is a direct consequence of the London equations.

The Meissner effect is characterized by the complete absence of magnetic fields within the superconductor, known as perfect diamagnetism. This means that the magnetic field within the superconductor is zero, and there is no magnetic induction. This effect is observed when the superconductor is cooled below its critical temperature, and it is a key factor in the practical applications of superconductivity.

The Meissner effect can be understood in terms of the London equations. The first equation describes the behavior of the current density $\mathbf{J}$ in the superconductor, and it shows that the current density is proportional to the vector potential $\mathbf{A}$. This means that as the magnetic field changes, the current density also changes, and this change is responsible for the expulsion of the magnetic field from the superconductor.

The second equation describes the behavior of the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ in the superconductor, and it shows that the magnetic field is related to the electric field $\mathbf{E}$. This relationship is crucial for understanding the Meissner effect, as it shows that any change in the magnetic field will result in a change in the electric field, which in turn will affect the current density and the expulsion of the magnetic field.

The Meissner effect has many practical applications, particularly in the field of levitation. Superconducting levitation, for example, is a technology that uses the Meissner effect to levitate objects, such as trains, without any physical contact. This technology has been used in high-speed trains in Japan and Germany, and it has the potential to revolutionize transportation systems.

In conclusion, the Meissner effect is a fundamental phenomenon in superconductivity that describes the expulsion of magnetic fields from the interior of a superconductor. It is a direct consequence of the London equations and has many practical applications, particularly in the field of levitation. Understanding the Meissner effect is crucial for understanding the behavior of superconductors and their applications.





### Section: 1.1c Zero resistivity

The concept of zero resistivity is a fundamental aspect of superconductivity. In a superconductor, the resistivity is defined as the ratio of the electric field to the current density. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$
\rho = \frac{E}{J}
$$

where $\rho$ is the resistivity, $E$ is the electric field, and $J$ is the current density. In a superconductor, the resistivity is zero, meaning that there is no opposition to the flow of electric current. This is a direct consequence of the London equations, which describe the behavior of superconductors.

The London equations are given by:

$$
\mathbf{J} = \frac{n_s e^2}{m} \mathbf{A}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} = \nabla \times \mathbf{E}
$$

where $\mathbf{J}$ is the current density, $n_s$ is the superfluid density, $e$ is the charge of the carrier, $m$ is the mass of the carrier, $\mathbf{A}$ is the vector potential, $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field, $t$ is time, and $\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field.

From these equations, we can see that the current density is proportional to the vector potential, and the magnetic field is related to the electric field. This means that any change in the magnetic field will result in a change in the electric field, which in turn will affect the current density and the resistivity.

The concept of zero resistivity has many practical applications in superconductivity. For example, it allows for the creation of superconducting magnets, which can produce extremely strong magnetic fields. These magnets have a wide range of applications, from medical imaging to particle accelerators.

Furthermore, the concept of zero resistivity is also crucial for the development of superconducting quantum computing. In these systems, the zero resistivity allows for the manipulation of quantum states without any loss of information, which is essential for the operation of a quantum computer.

In conclusion, the concept of zero resistivity is a fundamental aspect of superconductivity. It is a direct consequence of the London equations and has many practical applications in various fields. Understanding this concept is crucial for anyone studying or working in the field of applied superconductivity.





### Subsection: 1.2a Magnetic field expulsion

Magnetic field expulsion is a fundamental phenomenon in superconductivity that occurs when a superconductor is placed in a magnetic field. This phenomenon is a direct consequence of the London equations and the concept of zero resistivity.

When a superconductor is placed in a magnetic field, the magnetic field lines will try to penetrate the superconductor. However, due to the zero resistivity of the superconductor, the magnetic field lines are unable to penetrate the superconductor. This results in the formation of a boundary layer, known as the London penetration depth, where the magnetic field lines are expelled from the superconductor.

The London penetration depth, denoted by $\lambda_L$, is given by:

$$
\lambda_L = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2m^*k_BT_c}}
$$

where $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, $m^*$ is the effective mass of the carrier, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T_c$ is the critical temperature of the superconductor.

The London penetration depth is a crucial parameter in superconductivity as it determines the behavior of the superconductor in a magnetic field. For example, if the magnetic field is stronger than the critical field, $H_c$, the superconductor will lose its superconducting properties and become a normal conductor. This is known as the Meissner effect.

The Meissner effect is a direct consequence of the London equations and the concept of zero resistivity. When the magnetic field exceeds the critical field, the superconductor is unable to expel the magnetic field lines, and the magnetic field lines penetrate the superconductor. This results in the formation of vortices, known as magnetic vortices, where the magnetic field lines are trapped. These vortices disrupt the superconducting state and cause the superconductor to lose its superconducting properties.

In conclusion, magnetic field expulsion is a crucial phenomenon in superconductivity that occurs when a superconductor is placed in a magnetic field. It is a direct consequence of the London equations and the concept of zero resistivity. Understanding this phenomenon is crucial for the development of superconducting devices and applications.





### Subsection: 1.2b Flux quantization

Flux quantization is another fundamental phenomenon in superconductivity that occurs when a superconductor is placed in a magnetic field. This phenomenon is a direct consequence of the London equations and the concept of zero resistivity.

When a superconductor is placed in a magnetic field, the magnetic field lines will try to penetrate the superconductor. However, due to the zero resistivity of the superconductor, the magnetic field lines are unable to penetrate the superconductor. This results in the formation of a boundary layer, known as the London penetration depth, where the magnetic field lines are expelled from the superconductor.

The London penetration depth, denoted by $\lambda_L$, is given by:

$$

$$

where $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, $m^*$ is the effective mass of the carrier, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T_c$ is the critical temperature of the superconductor.

The London penetration depth is a crucial parameter in superconductivity as it determines the behavior of the superconductor in a magnetic field. For example, if the magnetic field is stronger than the critical field, $H_c$, the superconductor will lose its superconducting properties and become a normal conductor. This is known as the Meissner effect.

The Meissner effect is a direct consequence of the London equations and the concept of zero resistivity. When the magnetic field exceeds the critical field, the superconductor is unable to expel the magnetic field lines, and the magnetic field lines penetrate the superconductor. This results in the formation of vortices, known as magnetic vortices, where the magnetic field lines are trapped. These vortices disrupt the superconducting state and cause the superconductor to lose its superconducting properties.

However, if the magnetic field is below the critical field, the superconductor will exhibit a phenomenon known as flux quantization. This phenomenon is a direct consequence of the London equations and the concept of zero resistivity. When the magnetic field is below the critical field, the superconductor is able to expel the magnetic field lines, and the magnetic field lines are confined to the London penetration depth. This results in the formation of a magnetic field that is quantized in units of the flux quantum, denoted by $\Phi_0$:

$$
\Phi_0 = \frac{\hbar c}{2e}
$$

where $c$ is the speed of light and $e$ is the elementary charge. This quantization of the magnetic field is a unique property of superconductors and is not observed in normal conductors.

Flux quantization is a crucial phenomenon in superconductivity as it allows for the precise control of the magnetic field within the superconductor. This property has numerous applications, such as in the design of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) and superconducting quantum computing.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of vortices in more detail and discuss their role in superconductivity.





### Subsection: 1.2c Critical magnetic field

The critical magnetic field, denoted by $H_c$, is a crucial parameter in superconductivity. It is the maximum magnetic field that a superconductor can withstand before losing its superconducting properties. The critical magnetic field is a function of the temperature and the type of superconductor.

The critical magnetic field can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
H_c = \frac{\Phi_0}{2\pi\xi(T)}
$$

where $\Phi_0 = h/e$ is the flux quantum, $h$ is the Planck's constant, $e$ is the elementary charge, and $\xi(T)$ is the coherence length. The coherence length is a measure of the spatial extent over which the wave function of the superconducting electron pair can be considered to be uniform. It is given by:

$$
\xi(T) = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2m^*k_BT}}
$$

where $m^*$ is the effective mass of the carrier, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature.

The critical magnetic field is a crucial parameter in superconductivity as it determines the maximum magnetic field that a superconductor can withstand before losing its superconducting properties. If the magnetic field exceeds the critical field, the superconductor will lose its superconducting properties and become a normal conductor. This is known as the Meissner effect.

The Meissner effect is a direct consequence of the London equations and the concept of zero resistivity. When the magnetic field exceeds the critical field, the superconductor is unable to expel the magnetic field lines, and the magnetic field lines penetrate the superconductor. This results in the formation of vortices, known as magnetic vortices, where the magnetic field lines are trapped. These vortices disrupt the superconducting state and cause the superconductor to lose its superconducting properties.

In the next section, we will discuss the critical current density, another important parameter in superconductivity.





#### 1.3a London penetration depth

The London penetration depth, denoted by $\lambda_L$, is a crucial parameter in superconductivity. It is a measure of the depth to which a magnetic field can penetrate a superconductor before losing its superconducting properties. The London penetration depth is a function of the temperature and the type of superconductor.

The London penetration depth can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
\lambda_L = \frac{\Phi_0}{\sqrt{2\pi\mu_0\mu_rH_c}}
$$

where $\Phi_0 = h/e$ is the flux quantum, $h$ is the Planck's constant, $e$ is the elementary charge, $\mu_0$ is the vacuum permeability, $\mu_r$ is the relative permeability, and $H_c$ is the critical magnetic field.

The London penetration depth is a crucial parameter in superconductivity as it determines the depth to which a magnetic field can penetrate a superconductor before losing its superconducting properties. If the magnetic field exceeds the critical field, the superconductor will lose its superconducting properties and become a normal conductor. This is known as the Meissner effect.

The Meissner effect is a direct consequence of the London equations and the concept of zero resistivity. When the magnetic field exceeds the critical field, the superconductor is unable to expel the magnetic field lines, and the magnetic field lines penetrate the superconductor. This results in the formation of vortices, known as magnetic vortices, where the magnetic field lines are trapped. These vortices disrupt the superconducting state and cause the superconductor to lose its superconducting properties.

The London penetration depth is also closely related to the London equations, which describe the behavior of superconductors in the presence of a magnetic field. These equations are given by:

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{J} = -i\frac{e}{\hbar c}\mathbf{A}
$$

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0\mathbf{J}
$$

where $\mathbf{J}$ is the current density, $\mathbf{A}$ is the vector potential, and $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field. These equations describe the expulsion of magnetic field lines from a superconductor, known as the Meissner effect, and the formation of vortices when the magnetic field exceeds the critical field.

In the next section, we will discuss the critical current density, another important parameter in superconductivity.





#### 1.3b Fluxoid quantization

Fluxoid quantization is a fundamental concept in superconductivity that is closely related to the London equations. It is a phenomenon where the magnetic flux through a superconducting loop is quantized, meaning it can only take on certain discrete values. This effect is a direct consequence of the London equations and the concept of zero resistivity.

The fluxoid quantization can be understood by considering a superconducting loop in the presence of a magnetic field. According to the London equations, the magnetic field inside the superconductor is zero, and the magnetic field outside the superconductor is expelled. This means that the magnetic field lines are confined to the region outside the superconductor, forming a closed loop around the superconductor.

The magnetic flux through this loop can be calculated using the formula:

$$
\Phi = \oint_C \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{l}
$$

where $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field, $C$ is the closed loop, and $d\mathbf{l}$ is the differential element along the loop. According to the fluxoid quantization, the magnetic flux through the loop is quantized, meaning it can only take on certain discrete values. This effect is a direct consequence of the London equations and the concept of zero resistivity.

The fluxoid quantization is a crucial concept in superconductivity as it provides a deeper understanding of the behavior of superconductors in the presence of a magnetic field. It also has practical applications in the design of superconducting devices, such as SQUIDs (Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices), which are highly sensitive magnetic field detectors.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of vortices in superconductors, which are another important consequence of the London equations.

#### 1.3c Magnetic field screening

Magnetic field screening is a crucial concept in superconductivity that is closely related to the London equations. It is a phenomenon where the magnetic field inside a superconductor is completely screened, meaning it is completely expelled from the superconductor. This effect is a direct consequence of the London equations and the concept of zero resistivity.

The magnetic field screening can be understood by considering a superconductor in the presence of a magnetic field. According to the London equations, the magnetic field inside the superconductor is zero, and the magnetic field outside the superconductor is expelled. This means that the magnetic field lines are confined to the region outside the superconductor, forming a closed loop around the superconductor.

The magnetic field screening can be mathematically described by the London equations, which state that the magnetic field inside a superconductor is zero. This can be expressed as:

$$
\mathbf{B} = 0
$$

where $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field. This equation is a direct consequence of the London equations and the concept of zero resistivity.

The magnetic field screening has important implications for the behavior of superconductors. For example, it allows for the creation of superconducting magnets, which can produce extremely strong magnetic fields. This is because the magnetic field inside the superconductor is completely screened, meaning the superconductor can carry a large current without any energy loss due to resistance.

In addition, the magnetic field screening also plays a crucial role in the phenomenon of fluxoid quantization. As discussed in the previous section, the magnetic flux through a superconducting loop is quantized, meaning it can only take on certain discrete values. This is a direct consequence of the magnetic field screening, as the magnetic field lines are confined to the region outside the superconductor, forming a closed loop around the superconductor.

In conclusion, magnetic field screening is a fundamental concept in superconductivity that is closely related to the London equations. It plays a crucial role in the behavior of superconductors and has important applications in the creation of superconducting magnets and the understanding of fluxoid quantization.

#### 1.4a Drude model

The Drude model, named after physicist Paul Drude, is a classical model of a superconductor that provides a microscopic explanation for the macroscopic behavior of superconductors. It is based on the concept of electron scattering and is particularly useful in understanding the behavior of superconductors at high temperatures.

The Drude model assumes that the electrons in a superconductor behave as a gas of free particles. These electrons move through the lattice of the superconductor, experiencing collisions with the lattice atoms. These collisions are assumed to be elastic, meaning that the electrons retain their kinetic energy after the collision.

The Drude model can be used to derive the London equations, which describe the behavior of superconductors. The model assumes that the electrons in a superconductor move with a constant velocity, and that the magnetic field is expelled from the superconductor due to the scattering of electrons with the lattice atoms.

The Drude model can be mathematically described by the following equations:

$$
\mathbf{v} = \frac{\mathbf{E} \times \mathbf{B}}{m}
$$

$$
\mathbf{j} = nq\mathbf{v}
$$

where $\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity of the electrons, $\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field, $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field, $m$ is the mass of the electrons, $n$ is the number density of the electrons, $q$ is the charge of the electrons, and $\mathbf{j}$ is the current density.

The Drude model is particularly useful in understanding the behavior of superconductors at high temperatures, where the London equations may not be applicable. However, it is less accurate at low temperatures, where the behavior of superconductors is better described by the BCS theory.

In the next section, we will discuss the BCS theory, which provides a more comprehensive understanding of superconductivity.

#### 1.4b Ginzburg-Landau theory

The Ginzburg-Landau theory, named after physicists Lev Landau and Vitaly Ginzburg, is a phenomenological theory that describes the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature. It is particularly useful in understanding the behavior of superconductors at low temperatures, where the Drude model may not be applicable.

The Ginzburg-Landau theory is based on the concept of order parameter, which is a complex-valued function that describes the state of the superconductor. The order parameter, denoted by $\psi$, is zero in the normal state and non-zero in the superconducting state. The magnitude of the order parameter, $|\psi|$, is related to the superconducting density, while its phase, $\arg(\psi)$, is related to the superconducting phase.

The Ginzburg-Landau theory can be used to derive the London equations, which describe the behavior of superconductors. The theory assumes that the order parameter is a smooth function of the position, and that the superconducting state is a small perturbation of the normal state.

The Ginzburg-Landau theory can be mathematically described by the following equations:

$$
\psi = \sqrt{n_s}e^{i\theta}
$$

$$
\Delta = 2\hbar\omega_c\sqrt{n_s}
$$

$$
\Delta = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $\Delta$ is the energy gap, $n_s$ is the superconducting density, $\theta$ is the superconducting phase, $\omega_c$ is the critical frequency, $m$ is the mass of the electrons, and $x$ is the position.

The Ginzburg-Landau theory is particularly useful in understanding the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature. However, it is less accurate at high temperatures, where the behavior of superconductors is better described by the Drude model.

In the next section, we will discuss the BCS theory, which provides a more comprehensive understanding of superconductivity.

#### 1.4c BCS theory

The BCS theory, named after physicists John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Schrieffer, is a microscopic theory that provides a comprehensive understanding of superconductivity. It is particularly useful in understanding the behavior of superconductors at low temperatures, where the Ginzburg-Landau theory may not be applicable.

The BCS theory is based on the concept of Cooper pairs, which are pairs of electrons that interact with each other through the exchange of phonons. These pairs are formed due to an attractive interaction between the electrons, which is mediated by the phonons. The formation of Cooper pairs leads to the formation of a macroscopic wave function, which describes the collective behavior of all the Cooper pairs in the superconductor.

The BCS theory can be used to derive the London equations, which describe the behavior of superconductors. The theory assumes that the wave function of the Cooper pairs is a smooth function of the position, and that the superconducting state is a small perturbation of the normal state.

The BCS theory can be mathematically described by the following equations:

$$
\Psi = \sqrt{N_s}e^{i\phi}
$$

$$
\Delta = 2\hbar\omega_c\sqrt{N_s}
$$

$$
\Delta = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{\partial^2\Psi}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $\Psi$ is the wave function of the Cooper pairs, $N_s$ is the number of Cooper pairs, $\phi$ is the phase of the wave function, $\omega_c$ is the critical frequency, $m$ is the mass of the electrons, and $x$ is the position.

The BCS theory is particularly useful in understanding the behavior of superconductors at low temperatures. However, it is less accurate at high temperatures, where the behavior of superconductors is better described by the Ginzburg-Landau theory.

In the next section, we will discuss the applications of superconductivity, which are numerous and diverse.

## Chapter: Josephson junctions

### Introduction

The second chapter of "Applied Superconductivity: A Comprehensive Guide" delves into the fascinating world of Josephson junctions. Named after physicist Brian D. Josephson, these junctions are a fundamental component in superconducting electronics and quantum computing. They are known for their unique properties that allow for the transfer of supercurrents between two superconductors, even in the absence of an external electromagnetic field.

Josephson junctions are formed when two superconductors are separated by a thin insulating layer. This insulating layer, typically a few nanometers thick, prevents the flow of electric current but allows for the transfer of Cooper pairs, the fundamental particles of superconductivity. This phenomenon, known as the Josephson effect, is the basis for many superconducting devices and applications.

#### 1.4c BCS theory

The BCS theory, named after physicists John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Schrieffer, is a microscopic theory of superconductivity that provides a deeper understanding of the phenomenon. It is based on the concept of Cooper pairs, which are pairs of electrons that move through the lattice of the superconductor without experiencing scattering, unlike the Drude model.

The BCS theory assumes that the electrons in a superconductor interact with each other through the exchange of phonons, which are quanta of lattice vibrations. These interactions lead to the formation of Cooper pairs, which are bosonic in nature due to their integer spin.

The BCS theory can be mathematically described by the following equations:

$$
\Delta(\mathbf{k}) = \Delta_0 \frac{\tanh(\frac{1.74 \hbar \omega_c}{\Delta_0})}{\hbar \omega_c} \tanh(\frac{\hbar \omega_c}{2\Delta_0})
$$

$$
\Delta(\mathbf{k}) = \Delta_0 \frac{\tanh(\frac{1.74 \hbar \omega_c}{\Delta_0})}{\hbar \omega_c} \tanh(\frac{\hbar \omega_c}{2\Delta_0})
$$

where $\Delta(\mathbf{k})$ is the energy gap, $\Delta_0$ is the energy gap at zero temperature, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, $\omega_c$ is the characteristic frequency, and $\tanh$ is the hyperbolic tangent function.

The BCS theory is particularly useful in understanding the behavior of superconductors at low temperatures, where the London equations may not be applicable. It provides a microscopic explanation for the macroscopic behavior of superconductors, and has been validated by numerous experimental observations.

In the next section, we will discuss the Ginzburg-Landau theory, which provides a phenomenological description of superconductivity.

$$
\Delta(\mathbf{k}) = \Delta_0 \frac{\tanh(\frac{1.74 \hbar \omega_c}{\Delta_0})}{\hbar \omega_c} \tanh(\frac{\hbar \omega_c}{2\Delta_0})
$$

$$
\Delta(\mathbf{k}) = \Delta_0 \frac{\tanh(\frac{1.74 \hbar \omega_c}{\Delta_0})}{\hbar \omega_c} \tanh(\frac{\hbar \omega_c}{2\Delta_0})
$$

where $\Delta(\mathbf{k})$ is the energy gap, $\Delta_0$ is the energy gap at zero temperature, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, $\omega_c$ is the characteristic frequency, and $\tanh$ is the hyperbolic tangent function.

In the next section, we will discuss the Ginzburg-Landau theory, which provides a phenomenological description of superconductivity.

#### 1.4e Ginzburg-Landau theory

The Ginzburg-Landau theory, named after physicists V. Ginzburg and L. Landau, is a phenomenological theory of superconductivity that provides a macroscopic description of the phenomenon. Unlike the Maki-Thompson theory, which is a microscopic theory, the Ginzburg-Landau theory does not make specific assumptions about the underlying microscopic interactions between electrons and phonons. Instead, it describes the macroscopic behavior of superconductors in terms of a complex-valued order parameter, which is a measure of the degree of superconductivity in a given region of the material.

The Ginzburg-Landau theory can be mathematically described by the following equations:

$$
\Delta(\mathbf{k}) = \Delta_0 \frac{\tanh(\frac{1.74 \hbar \omega_c}{\Delta_0})}{\hbar \omega_c} \tanh(\frac{\hbar \omega_c}{2\Delta_0})
$$

$$
\Delta(\mathbf{k}) = \Delta_0 \frac{\tanh(\frac{1.74 \hbar \omega_c}{\Delta_0})}{\hbar \omega_c} \tanh(\frac{\hbar \omega_c}{2\Delta_0})
$$

where $\Delta(\mathbf{k})$ is the order parameter, $\Delta_0$ is the order parameter at zero temperature, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, $\omega_c$ is the characteristic frequency, and $\tanh$ is the hyperbolic tangent function.

The Ginzburg-Landau theory is particularly useful in understanding the behavior of superconductors at intermediate temperatures, where the London equations may not be applicable. It provides a macroscopic explanation for the macroscopic behavior of superconductors, and has been validated by numerous experimental observations.

In the next section, we will discuss the Ginzburg-Landau theory in more detail, and explore its implications for the behavior of superconductors.

#### 1.4c Cooper pairs

The Cooper pairs, named after physicist Leon Cooper, are a fundamental concept in the BCS theory of superconductivity. They are pairs of electrons that move through the lattice of the superconductor without experiencing scattering, unlike the Drude model. This phenomenon is known as superconductivity.

The Cooper pairs are formed due to the attractive interaction between electrons, which is mediated by the exchange of phonons. These interactions lead to the formation of Cooper pairs, which are bosonic in nature due to their integer spin.

The formation of Cooper pairs can be mathematically described by the following equations:

$$
\Delta(\mathbf{k}) = \Delta_0 \frac{\tanh(\frac{1.74 \hbar \omega_c}{\Delta_0})}{\hbar \omega_c} \tanh(\frac{\hbar \omega_c}{2\Delta_0})
$$

$$
\Delta(\mathbf{k}) = \Delta_0 \frac{\tanh(\frac{1.74 \hbar \omega_c}{\Delta_0})}{\hbar \omega_c} \tanh(\frac{\hbar \omega_c}{2\Delta_0})
$$

where $\Delta(\mathbf{k})$ is the energy gap, $\Delta_0$ is the energy gap at zero temperature, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, $\omega_c$ is the characteristic frequency, and $\tanh$ is the hyperbolic tangent function.

The Cooper pairs play a crucial role in the BCS theory, as they are responsible for the macroscopic behavior of superconductors. They provide a microscopic explanation for the macroscopic behavior of superconductors, and have been validated by numerous experimental observations.

In the next section, we will discuss the Maki-Thompson theory, another microscopic theory of superconductivity that provides a deeper understanding of the phenomenon.

#### 1.4d Maki-Thompson theory

The Maki-Thompson theory, named after physicists T. Maki and D. Thompson, is a microscopic theory of superconductivity that provides a deeper understanding of the phenomenon. It is based on the concept of Cooper pairs, which are pairs of electrons that move through the lattice of the superconductor without experiencing scattering, unlike the Drude model. This phenomenon is known as superconductivity.

The Maki-Thompson theory extends the BCS theory by considering the effects of impurities and disorder in the superconductor. In the BCS theory, the Cooper pairs are assumed to be perfect, with no impurities or disorder. However, in real-world superconductors, there are always impurities and disorder present, which can affect the behavior of the Cooper pairs.

The Maki-Thompson theory takes into account these impurities and disorder by introducing the concept of the impurity potential. This potential is a random potential that is added to the Hamiltonian of the system. It represents the random energy that the Cooper pairs experience due to the impurities and disorder in the superconductor.

The Maki-Thompson theory can be mathematically described by the following equations:

$$
\Delta(\mathbf{k}) = \Delta_0 \frac{\tanh(\frac{1.74 \hbar \omega_c}{\Delta_0})}{\hbar \omega_c} \tanh(\frac{\hbar \omega_c}{2\Delta_0}) + \Delta_I \frac{\tanh(\frac{1.74 \hbar \omega_c}{\Delta_I})}{\hbar \omega_c} \tanh(\frac{\hbar \omega_c}{2\Delta_I})
$$

$$
\Delta(\mathbf{k}) = \Delta_0 \frac{\tanh(\frac{1.74 \hbar \omega_c}{\Delta_0})}{\hbar \omega_c} \tanh(\frac{\hbar \omega_c}{2\Delta_0}) + \Delta_I \frac{\tanh(\frac{1.74 \hbar \omega_c}{\Delta_I})}{\hbar \omega_c} \tanh(\frac{\hbar \omega_c}{2\Delta_I})
$$

where $\Delta(\mathbf{k})$ is the energy gap, $\Delta_0$ is the energy gap at zero temperature, $\Delta_I$ is the energy gap due to the impurity potential, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, $\omega_c$ is the characteristic frequency, and $\tanh$ is the hyperbolic tangent function.

The Maki-Thompson theory provides a more realistic description of superconductivity, as it takes into account the effects of impurities and disorder. It has been used to explain many experimental observations, and has been a crucial tool in the development of superconducting materials.




#### 1.5a Power dissipation in superconductors

Superconductors, due to their unique properties, have the potential to revolutionize the field of electromagnetics. However, understanding the power dissipation in superconductors is crucial for their practical application.

In conventional conductors, power dissipation occurs due to the resistance of the material. However, in superconductors, the zero electrical resistance means that there is no power dissipation due to resistance. Instead, power dissipation in superconductors occurs due to two main factors: thermal conduction and quantum fluctuations.

Thermal conduction is a result of the temperature dependence of the superconducting state. As the temperature increases, the superconducting state becomes less stable, leading to a decrease in the critical current. This results in an increase in the power dissipation.

Quantum fluctuations, on the other hand, are a result of the quantum nature of superconductivity. These fluctuations can cause the superconducting state to become unstable, leading to a decrease in the critical current and an increase in the power dissipation.

The power dissipation in superconductors can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
P = \frac{1}{R} \int I^2 R dt
$$

where $P$ is the power dissipation, $I$ is the current, $R$ is the resistance, and $t$ is time. In superconductors, the resistance is zero, so the power dissipation is zero. However, due to thermal conduction and quantum fluctuations, the power dissipation is not zero.

#### 1.5b Energy storage in superconducting circuits

Superconducting circuits have the ability to store large amounts of energy in a compact and efficient manner. This is due to the unique properties of superconductors, which allow for the creation of circuits with extremely low resistance and high inductance. In this section, we will explore the concept of energy storage in superconducting circuits and its applications.

#### 1.5b.1 Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES)

Superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) is a technology that utilizes superconducting coils to store large amounts of energy in the form of a magnetic field. This technology was first invented by M. Ferrier in 1970 and has since been used in various applications, including power quality improvement and grid stabilization.

The basic principle behind SMES is the use of superconducting coils, which are cooled to extremely low temperatures to achieve superconductivity. Once the coils are charged, the current flowing through them creates a strong magnetic field, which can be used to store energy. This energy can then be released back to the network by discharging the coils.

One of the key advantages of SMES is its ability to store and release energy almost instantaneously. This makes it a viable option for short-term energy storage, particularly for improving power quality and grid stability. However, the high cost of superconducting wire and the energy requirements for refrigeration limit its use to short-term energy storage.

#### 1.5b.2 Superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs)

Superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) are another type of superconducting circuit that has the ability to store energy. SQUIDs are made up of two Josephson junctions, which are superconducting devices that exhibit a phenomenon known as the Josephson effect. This effect allows for the creation of extremely low-resistance circuits, which can be used to store large amounts of energy.

SQUIDs have been used in various applications, including high-speed computing and quantum computing. They have also been proposed as a potential solution for long-term energy storage, as they can store energy in the form of a superconducting state for extended periods of time.

#### 1.5b.3 Challenges and future developments

Despite the potential of superconducting circuits for energy storage, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed. One of the main challenges is the high cost of superconducting materials, which limits the scalability of these technologies. Additionally, the need for extremely low temperatures for superconductivity also adds to the overall cost and complexity of these systems.

However, with advancements in superconducting materials and refrigeration technology, these challenges may be overcome in the future. This could lead to the widespread adoption of superconducting circuits for long-term energy storage, making them a crucial component in the transition towards a more sustainable energy future.

### Section 2.1 Perfect Diamagnetism:

Superconductivity is a phenomenon that has been studied extensively since its discovery in 1911. It is a state of matter where certain materials exhibit zero electrical resistance and perfect diamagnetism when cooled below a critical temperature. This critical temperature, known as the transition temperature, is different for each superconducting material and is a key factor in determining its practical applications.

In this section, we will explore the concept of perfect diamagnetism in superconductors. Diamagnetism is a property of materials where they exhibit a repulsion to magnetic fields. In superconductors, this repulsion is perfect, meaning that the material completely expels the magnetic field from its interior. This is in contrast to normal conductors, where the magnetic field is only partially expelled.

#### 2.1a London's equation for perfect diamagnetism

The perfect diamagnetism observed in superconductors is a result of the London equations, named after the physicists Fritz London and Lev Landau. These equations describe the behavior of superconductors in the Meissner effect, where the magnetic field is completely expelled from the interior of the superconductor.

The London equations can be written as:

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{J} = -i\frac{e}{\hbar c} \mathbf{A}
$$

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J}
$$

where $\mathbf{J}$ is the current density, $\mathbf{A}$ is the vector potential, $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field, $e$ is the charge of the electron, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space.

These equations describe the behavior of superconductors in the Meissner effect, where the magnetic field is completely expelled from the interior of the superconductor. This is achieved by the superconducting material creating a counter magnetic field that opposes the external magnetic field. This counter magnetic field is created by the superconducting electrons moving in response to the external magnetic field, resulting in a perfect diamagnetic response.

The London equations also describe the behavior of superconductors in the Meissner effect, where the magnetic field is completely expelled from the interior of the superconductor. This is achieved by the superconducting material creating a counter magnetic field that opposes the external magnetic field. This counter magnetic field is created by the superconducting electrons moving in response to the external magnetic field, resulting in a perfect diamagnetic response.

In summary, the London equations play a crucial role in understanding the perfect diamagnetism observed in superconductors. They describe the behavior of superconductors in the Meissner effect and are essential in understanding the properties of superconductors. In the next section, we will explore the applications of perfect diamagnetism in superconductors.

## Electromagnetic properties

Properties depend greatly on composition and fabrication process. Many properties are anisotropic due to the layered structure. 'Dirty' samples, e.g., with oxides at the crystal boundaries, are different from 'clean' samples.


### Improvement by doping

Various means of doping MgB<sub>2</sub> with carbon (e.g. using 10% malic acid) can improve the upper critical field and the maximum current density
(also with polyvinyl acetate).

5% doping with carbon can raise H<sub>c2</sub> from 16 to 36 T while lowering "T"<sub>c</sub> only from 39 K to 34 K. The maximum critical current ("J"<sub>c</sub>) is reduced, but doping with TiB<sub>2</sub> can reduce the decrease. (Doping MgB<sub>2</sub> with Ti is patented.)

The maximum critical current ("J"<sub>c</sub>) in magnetic field is enhanced greatly (approx double at 4.2 K) by doping with ZrB<sub>2</sub>.

Even small amounts of doping lead both bands into the type II regime and so no semi-Meissner state may be expected.

## Thermal conductivity

MgB<sub>2</sub> is a multi-band superconductor, that is each Fermi surface has different superconducting energy gap. For MgB<sub>2</sub>, sigma bond of boron is strong, and it induces large s-wave superconducting gap, and pi bond is weak and induces small s-wave gap. 
The quasiparticle states of the vortices of large gap are highly confined to the vortex core.
On the other hand, the quasiparticle states of small gap are loosely bound to the vortex core. Thus they can be delocalized and overlap easily between adjacent vortices. Such delocalization can strongly contribute to the thermal conductivity, which shows abrupt increase above H<sub>c1</sub>.

## London's flux quantization in a superconductor

A principal property of superconductors is that they expel magnetic fields; this is called the Meissner effect. If the magnetic field becomes sufficiently strong it will, in some cases, âquenchâ the superconductive state. This is known as the critical field, and it is dependent on the type of superconductor. For example, in MgB<sub>2</sub>, the critical field is 16 T for the "clean" sample and 10 T for the "dirty" sample.

The Meissner effect is described by London's equation, which states that the magnetic field in a superconductor is proportional to the current density. This equation is given by:

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{J} = -i\frac{e}{\hbar c} \mathbf{A}
$$

where $\mathbf{J}$ is the current density, $\mathbf{A}$ is the vector potential, $e$ is the charge of the electron, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, and $c$ is the speed of light.

This equation is a consequence of the London equations, which describe the behavior of superconductors in the Meissner effect. These equations can be written as:

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{J} = -i\frac{e}{\hbar c} \mathbf{A}
$$

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J}
$$

where $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field, $\mu_0$ is the permeability of free space, and $\mathbf{J}$ is the current density.

These equations describe the behavior of superconductors in the Meissner effect, where the magnetic field is completely expelled from the interior of the superconductor. This is achieved by the superconducting material creating a counter magnetic field that opposes the external magnetic field. This counter magnetic field is created by the superconducting material's ability to carry current without any resistance, which allows for the creation of a strong magnetic field.

### Section: 2.1 Perfect Diamagnetism:

In the previous section, we discussed the Meissner effect, which is a fundamental property of superconductors that allows them to expel magnetic fields. In this section, we will explore the concept of perfect diamagnetism, which is a more general phenomenon that occurs in superconductors.

#### 2.1a London's equation for perfect diamagnetism

London's equation is a fundamental equation in the theory of superconductivity. It describes the behavior of superconductors in the presence of an external magnetic field. In the case of perfect diamagnetism, London's equation takes a simplified form.

The London equation for perfect diamagnetism can be written as:

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{J} = -i \frac{e}{\hbar c} \mathbf{A}
$$

where $\mathbf{J}$ is the current density, $\mathbf{A}$ is the vector potential, $e$ is the charge of the electron, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, and $c$ is the speed of light.

This equation describes the behavior of superconductors in the presence of an external magnetic field. The left-hand side of the equation represents the current density, which is proportional to the vector potential. The right-hand side of the equation represents the magnetic field, which is proportional to the current density. This equation shows that in a superconductor, the magnetic field and the current density are inversely proportional to each other.

In the case of perfect diamagnetism, the magnetic field is completely expelled from the superconductor. This means that the current density is zero, and the vector potential is also zero. Therefore, the London equation for perfect diamagnetism simplifies to:

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{J} = 0
$$

This equation shows that in perfect diamagnetism, there is no current density, and therefore no magnetic field. This is in contrast to the behavior of normal conductors, where the current density is proportional to the magnetic field.

The concept of perfect diamagnetism is closely related to the Meissner effect. In fact, the Meissner effect can be seen as a special case of perfect diamagnetism. In the Meissner effect, the magnetic field is completely expelled from the superconductor, and the current density is zero. This results in a perfect diamagnetic response.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of perfect diamagnetism and its applications in superconductivity.

#### 2.1b Diamagnetic response of superconductors

The diamagnetic response of superconductors is a crucial aspect of their behavior in the presence of an external magnetic field. As we have seen in the previous section, the London equation describes the behavior of superconductors in terms of the current density and the vector potential. In the case of perfect diamagnetism, the current density is zero, and the vector potential is also zero. This results in a diamagnetic response, where the magnetic field is completely expelled from the superconductor.

The diamagnetic response of superconductors can be understood in terms of the Meissner effect. When a superconductor is placed in an external magnetic field, the magnetic field induces a current density in the superconductor. This current density creates a magnetic field that opposes the external magnetic field. As the magnetic field opposes the external magnetic field, it creates a force that expels the magnetic field from the superconductor. This is the Meissner effect.

The Meissner effect is a direct consequence of the London equation. The equation shows that the magnetic field and the current density are inversely proportional to each other. As the current density is zero in a superconductor, the magnetic field is also zero. This results in the complete expulsion of the magnetic field from the superconductor.

The diamagnetic response of superconductors is not limited to perfect diamagnetism. In fact, there are two types of diamagnetism that can occur in superconductors: perfect diamagnetism and imperfect diamagnetism. In perfect diamagnetism, the magnetic field is completely expelled from the superconductor, and the current density is zero. In imperfect diamagnetism, the magnetic field is not completely expelled, and the current density is non-zero.

The diamagnetic response of superconductors has important implications for their applications. For example, the Meissner effect is used in superconducting magnets, where the expulsion of the magnetic field allows for the creation of strong and stable magnetic fields. The diamagnetic response also plays a crucial role in the design of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), which are highly sensitive to magnetic fields.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of imperfect diamagnetism and its implications for superconductivity.

#### 2.1c Magnetic field expulsion in type I superconductors

In the previous section, we discussed the diamagnetic response of superconductors, which is a direct consequence of the London equation. In this section, we will delve deeper into the behavior of superconductors in the presence of an external magnetic field, focusing on type I superconductors.

Type I superconductors are characterized by a single critical magnetic field, known as the critical field, above which they lose their superconducting properties. Below this critical field, type I superconductors exhibit perfect diamagnetism, where the magnetic field is completely expelled from the superconductor. This is due to the Meissner effect, which we discussed in the previous section.

The behavior of type I superconductors can be understood in terms of the Ginzburg-Landau theory, which describes the transition from the normal state to the superconducting state in a superconductor. According to this theory, the order parameter, which describes the superconducting state, is a complex-valued function that varies smoothly from zero in the normal state to a constant value in the superconducting state.

The Ginzburg-Landau theory also introduces the concept of the coherence length, which is the characteristic length scale over which the order parameter varies significantly. In type I superconductors, the coherence length is typically much smaller than the London penetration depth, which is the characteristic length scale over which the magnetic field penetrates the superconductor.

The coherence length plays a crucial role in the behavior of type I superconductors. In particular, it determines the critical field above which the superconductor loses its superconducting properties. As the magnetic field increases, the order parameter decreases, and eventually reaches zero at the critical field. This results in the loss of superconductivity.

The behavior of type I superconductors in the presence of an external magnetic field can be described by the Ginzburg-Landau equations, which are a set of nonlinear partial differential equations. These equations describe the evolution of the order parameter and the magnetic field in the superconductor.

In the next section, we will discuss the behavior of type II superconductors, which exhibit a more complex response to an external magnetic field.

#### 2.1d Magnetic field expulsion in type II superconductors

In the previous section, we discussed the behavior of type I superconductors in the presence of an external magnetic field. We saw that these superconductors exhibit perfect diamagnetism, where the magnetic field is completely expelled from the superconductor. In this section, we will explore the behavior of type II superconductors, which exhibit a more complex response to an external magnetic field.

Type II superconductors are characterized by two critical magnetic fields, known as the lower and upper critical fields. The lower critical field is the minimum magnetic field that can be applied to a superconductor before it loses its superconducting properties. The upper critical field, on the other hand, is the maximum magnetic field that can be applied before the superconductor transitions back to the normal state.

Between these two critical fields, type II superconductors exhibit a phenomenon known as the mixed state, where the magnetic field is only partially expelled from the superconductor. This is due to the presence of vortices, which are regions within the superconductor where the magnetic field is not completely expelled.

The behavior of type II superconductors can be understood in terms of the Ginzburg-Landau theory, just like type I superconductors. However, in type II superconductors, the coherence length is typically of the same order as the London penetration depth. This results in a more complex behavior, where the magnetic field can penetrate the superconductor in the form of vortices.

The Ginzburg-Landau theory also introduces the concept of the coherence length, which is the characteristic length scale over which the order parameter varies significantly. In type II superconductors, the coherence length is typically much smaller than the London penetration depth, which is the characteristic length scale over which the magnetic field penetrates the superconductor.

The coherence length plays a crucial role in the behavior of type II superconductors. In particular, it determines the critical field above which the superconductor loses its superconducting properties. As the magnetic field increases, the order parameter decreases, and eventually reaches zero at the upper critical field. This results in the loss of superconductivity.

The behavior of type II superconductors in the presence of an external magnetic field can be described by the Ginzburg-Landau equations, which are a set of nonlinear partial differential equations. These equations describe the evolution of the order parameter and the magnetic field in the superconductor.

In the next section, we will discuss the applications of superconductivity in the field of quantum computing.

## Chapter: Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices

### Introduction

Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices, or SQUIDs, are a class of superconducting devices that exploit the quantum mechanical properties of superconductors. These devices have found applications in a wide range of fields, from medical imaging to geophysical exploration. The unique properties of superconductors, such as zero electrical resistance and perfect diamagnetism, make SQUIDs a powerful tool for detecting and manipulating quantum states.

In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of SQUIDs, exploring their principles of operation, their construction, and their applications. We will begin by discussing the basics of superconductivity and the Meissner effect, which are fundamental to understanding SQUIDs. We will then move on to the principles of quantum interference and how it is harnessed in SQUIDs.

We will also discuss the construction of SQUIDs, including the fabrication techniques used to create these delicate devices. This will involve a discussion of the materials used, the fabrication processes, and the challenges faced in creating these devices.

Finally, we will explore the applications of SQUIDs. This will include their use in medical imaging, where their high sensitivity and low noise make them ideal for detecting subtle changes in the body's magnetic field. We will also discuss their use in geophysical exploration, where their sensitivity to extremely small magnetic fields makes them invaluable for studying the Earth's magnetic field.

Throughout this chapter, we will use the mathematical language of quantum mechanics and electromagnetism to describe these devices. This will involve the use of complex numbers, vector calculus, and differential equations. For example, the Meissner effect can be described by the London equations, which can be written as:

$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{J} = -i \frac{e}{\hbar c} \mathbf{A}
$$

where $\mathbf{J}$ is the current density, $\mathbf{A}$ is the vector potential, $e$ is the charge of the electron, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, and $c$ is the speed of light.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of SQUIDs, their principles of operation, their construction, and their applications. You will also have the mathematical tools to describe these devices and their behavior.




### Section: 2.2 Macroscopic Quantum Model:

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of perfect diamagnetism and London's equation. In this section, we will explore the macroscopic quantum model, which is a more general model that describes the behavior of superconductors.

#### 2.2a Ginzburg-Landau theory

The Ginzburg-Landau theory is a phenomenological theory that describes the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature. It was first proposed by Lev Landau and Vitaly Ginzburg in 1950. The theory is based on the concept of order parameter, which is a complex-valued function that describes the state of the superconductor.

The Ginzburg-Landau theory is based on the following assumptions:

1. The order parameter is a complex-valued function that describes the state of the superconductor.
2. The order parameter is continuous and differentiable.
3. The order parameter is zero above the critical temperature and non-zero below the critical temperature.
4. The order parameter is complex conjugate symmetric, i.e. $\psi^*(\mathbf{r}) = \psi(\mathbf{r})$.
5. The order parameter is related to the superconducting wave function $\Psi(\mathbf{r})$ by the relation $\psi(\mathbf{r}) = \sqrt{2} |\Psi(\mathbf{r})| e^{i \theta(\mathbf{r})}$, where $\theta(\mathbf{r})$ is the phase of the wave function.

Using these assumptions, the Ginzburg-Landau theory can be used to derive the following equations:

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} |\nabla \psi|^2 + \alpha |\psi|^2 + \frac{\beta}{2} |\psi|^4 = 0
$$

$$
\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} |\nabla \psi^*|^2 + \alpha |\psi^*|^2 + \frac{\beta}{2} |\psi^*|^4 = 0
$$

where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants that depend on the material properties and the temperature. These equations describe the behavior of the order parameter in the superconductor.

The Ginzburg-Landau theory is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature. It has been used to derive many important properties of superconductors, such as the critical temperature, the energy gap, and the Meissner effect. However, it is important to note that the theory is only valid near the critical temperature and cannot be used to describe the behavior of superconductors at lower temperatures.

In the next section, we will explore the macroscopic quantum model in more detail and discuss its applications in superconductivity.





#### 2.2b Coherence length and penetration depth

The Ginzburg-Landau theory also provides a way to understand the coherence length and penetration depth of a superconductor. The coherence length, denoted by $\xi$, is a measure of the spatial extent over which the superconductor behaves as a single entity. It is related to the order parameter by the equation:

$$
\xi = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2m\alpha}}
$$

The penetration depth, denoted by $\lambda$, is a measure of the distance over which the superconducting wave function can penetrate into a normal metal. It is related to the order parameter by the equation:

$$
\lambda = \frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2m\beta}}
$$

These equations show that the coherence length and penetration depth are both inversely proportional to the square root of the mass and the square root of the material properties $\alpha$ and $\beta$. This means that materials with a higher mass or a lower value of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ will have a longer coherence length and a deeper penetration depth.

The coherence length and penetration depth are important properties of a superconductor as they determine the behavior of the superconductor near the critical temperature. A longer coherence length and a deeper penetration depth indicate a stronger superconducting state and a higher critical temperature.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of the Ginzburg-Landau theory for the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature.

#### 2.2c Macroscopic quantum effects

The Ginzburg-Landau theory also provides a way to understand the macroscopic quantum effects that occur in superconductors. These effects are a direct consequence of the wave-like nature of the superconducting wave function and the macroscopic quantum model.

One of the most important macroscopic quantum effects is the Meissner effect, which is the expulsion of magnetic fields from the interior of a superconductor. This effect is a direct consequence of the wave-like nature of the superconducting wave function and the macroscopic quantum model. The Meissner effect is described by London's equation, which states that the magnetic field inside a superconductor is zero.

Another important macroscopic quantum effect is the Josephson effect, which is the phenomenon of supercurrent flow between two superconductors separated by a thin insulating barrier. This effect is a direct consequence of the wave-like nature of the superconducting wave function and the macroscopic quantum model. The Josephson effect is described by the Josephson equation, which states that the supercurrent between two superconductors is proportional to the sine of the phase difference across the insulating barrier.

The macroscopic quantum effects have been experimentally observed and have important applications in superconducting devices. For example, the Meissner effect is used in superconducting levitation and the Josephson effect is used in superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs).

In the next section, we will explore the implications of the Ginzburg-Landau theory for the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature.




#### 2.2c Macroscopic wave function

The macroscopic wave function, also known as the Ginzburg-Landau wave function, is a key concept in the Ginzburg-Landau theory. It describes the collective behavior of the superconducting electrons in a macroscopic scale, and is a direct consequence of the wave-like nature of the superconducting wave function.

The macroscopic wave function, denoted by $\Psi$, is defined as:

$$
\Psi = \sqrt{\frac{m}{2\hbar}}\psi
$$

where $m$ is the mass of the electron, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, and $\psi$ is the wave function of the superconductor. The macroscopic wave function is a complex-valued function, and its absolute square $|\Psi|^2$ gives the probability density of finding a superconducting electron at a given point in space.

The macroscopic wave function plays a crucial role in the Ginzburg-Landau theory. It is used to derive the Ginzburg-Landau equations, which describe the behavior of a superconductor near the critical temperature. These equations show that the macroscopic wave function is a function of the order parameter $\Psi$, which is a measure of the superconducting state of the material.

The macroscopic wave function also plays a key role in the macroscopic quantum effects that occur in superconductors. For example, the Meissner effect, which is the expulsion of magnetic fields from the interior of a superconductor, is a direct consequence of the wave-like nature of the macroscopic wave function.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of the macroscopic wave function for the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature.




#### 2.3a Josephson effect

The Josephson effect is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that describes the flow of supercurrent across a thin insulating barrier between two superconductors. This effect is a direct consequence of the Josephson equations, which describe the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature.

The Josephson effect is characterized by three main effects: the DC Josephson effect, the AC Josephson effect, and the inverse AC Josephson effect.

##### DC Josephson effect

The DC Josephson effect is a direct current that flows across the insulator in the absence of any external electromagnetic field. This effect is a result of the tunneling of Cooper pairs across the insulating barrier. The DC Josephson current is proportional to the sine of the Josephson phase, which is the phase difference across the insulator. This phase difference remains constant over time and can take values between $-I_c$ and $I_c$, where $I_c$ is the critical current of the junction.

##### AC Josephson effect

When a fixed voltage $V_{DC}$ is applied across the junction, the Josephson phase varies linearly with time, and the current becomes an alternating current (AC) with amplitude $I_c$ and frequency $K_J V_{DC}$. This means that a Josephson junction can act as a perfect voltage-to-frequency converter.

##### Inverse AC Josephson effect

The inverse AC Josephson effect describes the behavior of a Josephson junction when it is subjected to microwave radiation of a single frequency $\omega$. In this case, the Josephson phase takes the form $\varphi (t) = \varphi_0 + n \omega t + a \sin(\omega t)$, and the voltage and current across the junction are given by:

$$
V(t) = \frac{\hbar}{2 e} \omega ( n + a \cos( \omega t) ), \text{ and } I(t) = I_c \sum_{m = -\infty}^\infty J_m (a) \sin (\varphi_0 + (n + m) \omega t),
$$

where $J_m (a)$ is the Bessel function of the first kind. The DC components of the voltage and current are:

$$
V_\text{DC} = n \frac{\hbar}{2 e} \omega, \text{ and } I_\text{DC} = I_c J_{-n} (a) \sin \varphi_0.
$$

This means that a Josephson junction can act like a perfect frequency-to-voltage converter, which is the theoretical basis for the Josephson voltage standard.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical formulation of the Josephson effect, providing a comprehensive understanding of the underlying principles and their implications for superconductivity.

#### 2.3b AC Josephson effect

The AC Josephson effect is a phenomenon that occurs when a Josephson junction is subjected to an alternating current (AC) voltage. This effect is a direct consequence of the Josephson equations and is characterized by the sinusoidal variation of the current with the applied voltage.

The AC Josephson effect can be described by the following equations:

$$
I(t) = I_c \sin(\varphi(t)),
$$

where $I(t)$ is the current at time $t$, $I_c$ is the critical current of the junction, and $\varphi(t)$ is the Josephson phase at time $t$. The Josephson phase is given by:

$$
\varphi(t) = \varphi_0 + \frac{\hbar}{2e} \int_0^t V(t') dt',
$$

where $\varphi_0$ is the initial phase of the junction, $V(t')$ is the voltage at time $t'$, and the integral is taken from $t' = 0$ to $t' = t$.

The AC Josephson effect is a fundamental property of superconductors and is used in a variety of applications, including superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) and superconducting quantum computing.

#### 2.3c DC-SQUID

A DC-SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) is a type of SQUID that operates in the DC regime. It is a superconducting device that exploits the AC Josephson effect to measure extremely small magnetic fields. The DC-SQUID is a key component in many applications, including magnetic field imaging, magnetometers, and quantum computing.

The DC-SQUID consists of a superconducting loop interrupted by two Josephson junctions. The loop is biased with a DC current, and the junctions are capacitively coupled. The magnetic flux through the loop can be varied by an external magnetic field. The AC Josephson effect causes the current through the junctions to vary sinusoidally with the magnetic flux.

The operation of the DC-SQUID can be described by the following equations:

$$
I(t) = I_c \sin(\varphi(t)),
$$

where $I(t)$ is the current at time $t$, $I_c$ is the critical current of the junction, and $\varphi(t)$ is the Josephson phase at time $t$. The Josephson phase is given by:

$$
\varphi(t) = \varphi_0 + \frac{\hbar}{2e} \int_0^t V(t') dt',
$$

where $\varphi_0$ is the initial phase of the junction, $V(t')$ is the voltage at time $t'$, and the integral is taken from $t' = 0$ to $t' = t$.

The DC-SQUID is a highly sensitive device that can detect extremely small changes in the magnetic flux. This makes it an invaluable tool in many applications, including the detection of extremely weak magnetic fields, the study of quantum phenomena, and the development of quantum computing technologies.




#### 2.3b AC Josephson effect

The AC Josephson effect is a phenomenon that occurs when a Josephson junction is subjected to an alternating voltage. This effect is a direct consequence of the AC Josephson equation, which describes the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature.

V(t) = \frac{\hbar}{2 e} \omega ( n + a \cos( \omega t) ), \text{ and } I(t) = I_c \sum_{m = -\infty}^\infty J_m (a) \sin (\varphi_0 + (n + m) \omega t),
$$

where $J_m (a)$ is the Bessel function of the first kind. The DC components of the voltage and current are:

$$
V_\text{DC} = n \frac{\hbar}{2 e} \omega, \text{ and } I_\text{DC} = I_c J_{-n} (a) \sin \varphi_0.
$$

This means that a Josephson junction can act as a perfect frequency-to-voltage converter.

#### 2.3c Inverse AC Josephson effect

The inverse AC Josephson effect is a phenomenon that occurs when a Josephson junction is subjected to microwave radiation of a single frequency $\omega$. This effect is a direct consequence of the AC Josephson equation, which describes the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature.

The inverse AC Josephson effect is characterized by three main effects: the DC Josephson effect, the AC Josephson effect, and the inverse AC Josephson effect.

##### DC Josephson effect

The DC Josephson effect is a direct current that flows across the insulator in the absence of any external electromagnetic field. This effect is a result of the tunneling of Cooper pairs across the insulating barrier. The DC Josephson current is proportional to the sine of the Josephson phase, which is the phase difference across the insulator. This phase difference remains constant over time and can take values between $-I_c$ and $I_c$, where $I_c$ is the critical current of the junction.

##### AC Josephson effect

When a fixed voltage $V_{DC}$ is applied across the junction, the phase will vary linearly with time and the current will be a sinusoidal AC with amplitude $I_c$ and frequency $K_J V_{DC}$. This means a Josephson junction can act as a perfect voltage-to-frequency converter.

##### Inverse AC Josephson effect

The inverse AC Josephson effect describes the behavior of a Josephson junction when it is subjected to microwave radiation of a single frequency $\omega$. In this case, the Josephson phase takes the form $\varphi (t) = \varphi_0 + n \omega t + a \sin(\omega t)$, and the voltage and current across the junction are given by:

$$
V(t) = \frac{\hbar}{2 e} \omega ( n + a \cos( \omega t) ), \text{ and } I(t) = I_c \sum_{m = -\infty}^\infty J_m (a) \sin (\varphi_0 + (n + m) \omega t),
$$

where $J_m (a)$ is the Bessel function of the first kind. The DC components of the voltage and current are:

$$
V_\text{DC} = n \frac{\hbar}{2 e} \omega, \text{ and } I_\text{DC} = I_c J_{-n} (a) \sin \varphi_0.
$$

This means that a Josephson junction can act as a perfect frequency-to-voltage converter, which is the theoretical basis for the Josephson voltage standard.




#### 2.3c DC-SQUID

The DC-SQUID (Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) is a type of superconducting quantum interference device that operates in the DC regime. It is a highly sensitive magnetic field detector and has been used in a variety of applications, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetometers, and quantum computing.

The DC-SQUID operates based on the principle of superconductivity, where Cooper pairs of electrons can flow without resistance. The device consists of a superconducting loop interrupted by two Josephson junctions. When a magnetic field is applied to the loop, it induces a current in the loop, which in turn induces a voltage across the junctions. This voltage can be measured and is proportional to the applied magnetic field.

The operation of the DC-SQUID can be described by the AC Josephson equation, which we discussed in the previous section. When a magnetic field is applied to the loop, the Josephson phase across the junctions changes, leading to a change in the current and voltage across the junctions. This change can be measured and used to detect the magnetic field.

The DC-SQUID has a number of advantages over other types of magnetic field detectors. It has a high sensitivity, with the ability to detect extremely small magnetic fields. It also has a high bandwidth, allowing it to detect rapid changes in magnetic fields. Furthermore, the DC-SQUID is a non-invasive detector, meaning it does not require physical contact with the object being measured.

In the next section, we will discuss the applications of the DC-SQUID in more detail.




#### 2.4a Josephson junctions in series

In the previous section, we discussed the DC-SQUID, a device that operates based on the principles of superconductivity and the Josephson effect. In this section, we will delve deeper into the Josephson effect and explore the behavior of Josephson junctions in series.

The Josephson effect is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that allows for the flow of direct current across an insulator, owing to tunneling. This effect is described by the Josephson equations, which predict three main effects: the DC Josephson effect, the AC Josephson effect, and the Shapiro effect.

The DC Josephson effect is a direct current that flows across the insulator in the absence of any external electromagnetic field. This current is proportional to the sine of the Josephson phase, which is the phase difference across the insulator. The DC Josephson current can take values between $-I_c$ and $I_c$, where $I_c$ is the critical current of the junction.

When two Josephson junctions are connected in series, the total current flowing through the system is the sum of the currents flowing through each junction. This can be understood by applying Kirchhoff's circuit laws. According to Kirchhoff's current law (KCL), the total current at any point in the circuit must be equal to the sum of the currents entering and leaving that point. Therefore, for two junctions in series, we have:

$$
I = I_1 + I_2
$$

where $I$ is the total current, and $I_1$ and $I_2$ are the currents flowing through the first and second junctions, respectively.

Similarly, according to Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL), the total voltage across a series circuit must be equal to the sum of the voltages across each component. Applying this law to our system, we have:

$$
V = V_1 + V_2
$$

where $V$ is the total voltage, and $V_1$ and $V_2$ are the voltages across the first and second junctions, respectively.

These equations can be used to calculate the total current and voltage in the system, and to understand the behavior of the junctions in series. In the next section, we will explore the AC Josephson effect and the Shapiro effect, and how they are affected by the series connection of Josephson junctions.

#### 2.4b Josephson junctions in parallel

In the previous section, we explored the behavior of Josephson junctions in series. Now, we will turn our attention to junctions in parallel. 

When two Josephson junctions are connected in parallel, the total voltage across the system is the same across each junction. This can be understood by applying Kirchhoff's circuit laws. According to Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL), the total voltage at any point in the circuit must be equal to the sum of the voltages entering and leaving that point. Therefore, for two junctions in parallel, we have:

$$
V = V_1 = V_2
$$

where $V$ is the total voltage, and $V_1$ and $V_2$ are the voltages across the first and second junctions, respectively.

The total current flowing through the system is the sum of the currents flowing through each junction. This can be understood by applying Kirchhoff's current law (KCL). According to KCL, the total current at any point in the circuit must be equal to the sum of the currents entering and leaving that point. Therefore, for two junctions in parallel, we have:

$$
I = I_1 + I_2
$$

where $I$ is the total current, and $I_1$ and $I_2$ are the currents flowing through the first and second junctions, respectively.

These equations can be used to calculate the total voltage and current in the system, and to understand the behavior of the junctions in parallel. In the next section, we will explore the AC Josephson effect and the Shapiro effect, and how they are affected by the parallel connection of Josephson junctions.

#### 2.4c Josephson junctions in parallel and series

In the previous sections, we have explored the behavior of Josephson junctions in series and in parallel. Now, we will discuss the behavior of junctions when they are connected in both series and parallel.

When two Josephson junctions are connected in series and parallel, the total voltage across the system is the same across each junction. This can be understood by applying Kirchhoff's circuit laws. According to Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL), the total voltage at any point in the circuit must be equal to the sum of the voltages entering and leaving that point. Therefore, for two junctions in series and parallel, we have:

$$
V = V_1 = V_2
$$

where $V$ is the total voltage, and $V_1$ and $V_2$ are the voltages across the first and second junctions, respectively.

These equations can be used to calculate the total voltage and current in the system, and to understand the behavior of the junctions in both series and parallel. In the next section, we will explore the AC Josephson effect and the Shapiro effect, and how they are affected by the connection of junctions in series and parallel.




#### 2.4b Josephson junctions in parallel

In the previous section, we discussed the behavior of Josephson junctions in series. Now, we will explore the behavior of Josephson junctions in parallel.

When two Josephson junctions are connected in parallel, the total voltage across the system is the sum of the voltages across each junction. This can be understood by applying Kirchhoff's circuit laws. According to Kirchhoff's voltage law (KVL), the total voltage across a parallel circuit must be equal to the sum of the voltages across each component. Therefore, for two junctions in parallel, we have:

$$
V = V_1 = V_2
$$

where $V$ is the total voltage, and $V_1$ and $V_2$ are the voltages across the first and second junctions, respectively.

The total current flowing through the system is the sum of the currents flowing through each junction. This can be understood by applying Kirchhoff's current law (KCL).

$$
I = I_1 + I_2
$$

where $I$ is the total current, and $I_1$ and $I_2$ are the currents flowing through the first and second junctions, respectively.

These equations can be used to calculate the total voltage and current in the system. However, it is important to note that the behavior of Josephson junctions in parallel can be more complex than in series, due to the potential for current sharing and the effects of the McCumberâStewart model.

The McCumberâStewart model describes the behavior of the Josephson junction itself, including the effects of the Josephson element and the parallel capacitance $C$. The external circuit is usually modeled as a resistor $R$ in parallel with the Josephson element. The set of three parallel circuit elements is biased by an external current source $I$, thus the current-biased Josephson junction. Solving the circuit equations yields a single dynamic equation for the phase, which can be used to describe the behavior of the Josephson junction in parallel.

In the next section, we will explore the applications of Josephson junctions in parallel, including their use in superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) and their role in the quantum Hall effect.

#### 2.4c Josephson junctions in series and parallel

$$

where $I$ is the total current, and $I_1$ and $I_2$ are the currents flowing through the first and second junctions, respectively.

These equations can be used to calculate the total voltage and current in the system. However, it is important to note that the behavior of Josephson junctions in series and parallel can be more complex than in either series or parallel alone, due to the potential for current sharing and the effects of the McCumberâStewart model.

The McCumberâStewart model describes the behavior of the Josephson junction itself, including the effects of the Josephson element and the parallel capacitance $C$. The external circuit is usually modeled as a resistor $R$ in parallel with the Josephson element.

In the next section, we will explore the applications of Josephson junctions in series and parallel, including their use in superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) and their role in the quantum Hall effect.




#### 2.4c Shapiro steps

In the previous sections, we have discussed the behavior of Josephson junctions in series and parallel. Now, we will explore a phenomenon known as Shapiro steps, which is a manifestation of the quantum mechanical nature of Josephson junctions.

Shapiro steps are a series of discrete voltage steps that occur when a microwave signal is applied to a Josephson junction. These steps are named after the physicist Norman Shapiro, who first observed them in 1969.

The Shapiro steps occur due to the quantum mechanical nature of the Josephson junction. According to the Josephson effect, the junction can only allow current to flow in discrete steps, known as Cooper pairs. When a microwave signal is applied, it can cause the junction to switch between these steps, resulting in a series of discrete voltage steps.

The voltage steps are given by the equation:

$$
V = n \hbar \omega / 2e
$$

where $V$ is the voltage, $n$ is an integer, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, $\omega$ is the frequency of the microwave signal, and $e$ is the charge of an electron.

The Shapiro steps have been observed in a variety of experiments, and they have been used to study the quantum mechanical nature of Josephson junctions. They have also been used in quantum computing, where they can be used to manipulate the quantum state of a system.

In the next section, we will explore another important aspect of Josephson junctions: their use in superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs).

SQUIDs are essentially Josephson junctions that are connected in a specific way. The junctions are typically made of superconducting materials, such as niobium or titanium nitride, and they are cooled to extremely low temperatures, typically below 10 K.

The key feature of SQUIDs is their ability to exhibit quantum interference. This means that when two or more SQUIDs are connected in parallel, the total current flowing through the system can be greater than the sum of the individual currents. This is a direct consequence of the quantum mechanical nature of superconductors, where the current is carried by Cooper pairs.

The behavior of SQUIDs can be described using the Josephson equations, which are a set of coupled differential equations that describe the behavior of Josephson junctions. These equations take into account the quantum mechanical nature of the junctions, and they can be used to predict the behavior of SQUIDs under different conditions.

#### 2.5b Superconducting quantum computing

Superconducting quantum computing is a promising approach to building a quantum computer. It leverages the unique properties of superconductors to create quantum bits, or qubits, that can exist in a superposition of states. This allows for the parallel processing of quantum algorithms, which can solve certain problems much more efficiently than classical computers.

One of the key challenges in superconducting quantum computing is the extremely low temperatures at which superconductors exist. This is typically below 10 K, which requires the use of cryogenic cooling systems. However, recent advancements in superconducting materials have led to the discovery of high-temperature superconductors, which could potentially reduce the need for such extreme cooling.

Another challenge is shaping the potential well and choosing particle mass such that energy separation between two specific energy levels is unique. This is crucial for creating qubits that can be reliably manipulated and read out. Researchers are also working to mitigate quantum noise and leakage, which can disrupt the system and cause information to be lost to the environment.

The journey of superconducting quantum computing began in the latter half of the 1990s when quantum tunneling across Josephson junctions was discovered. This led to the realization that quantum computing could be achieved through these superconducting qubits.

In 1999, a paper was published by Yasunobu Nakamura, which introduced the initial design of a superconducting qubit known as the "charge qubit". This design served as the basis for later developments, although it had its limitations. These initial qubits were limited in their coherence time and scalability, among other factors.

Despite these challenges, superconducting quantum computing has made significant progress in recent years. Researchers have been able to create larger-scale devices, improve qubit coherence, and develop scalable calibration software. They have also made strides in determining the fidelity of quantum states across an entire chip and improving qubit and gate fidelity.

These include the strength of the magnetic field, the temperature, and the properties of the superconductor. The formation of vortices can be described by the Ginzburg-Landau theory, which provides a mathematical framework for understanding the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature.

#### Flux Pinning in Type-II Superconductors

One of the most significant advantages of type-II superconductors is their ability to trap magnetic fields, a phenomenon known as flux pinning. This is not possible with type-I superconductors, since they cannot be penetrated by magnetic fields. Flux pinning allows type-II superconductors to be suspended over a magnet, with the potential for a frictionless joint or bearing. This property has numerous practical applications, including in the design of levitating trains and frictionless joints in machinery.

The strength of the pinning that occurs when a superconductor is exposed to a magnetic field is dependent on the thickness of the superconducting layer. Thinner layers result in stronger pinning, which can be beneficial in applications where high critical currents are required.

#### Materials for Type-II Superconductors

Type-II superconductors can be made from a variety of materials, including metal alloys, complex oxide ceramics, and intermetallic compounds. High-temperature superconductors, which exhibit superconductivity at temperatures above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen, are all type-II superconductors. These include materials like La<sub>1.85</sub>Ba<sub>0.15</sub>CuO<sub>4</sub>, BSCCO, and YBCO (Yttrium-Barium-Copper-Oxide).

The cuprates, in particular, are known for their strong vortex pinning, making them ideal for applications that require high critical currents. However, the high cost of producing these materials and the difficulty in controlling their properties make them less practical for many applications.

In conclusion, type-II superconductors, with their unique ability to trap magnetic fields and their potential for high critical currents, offer a promising avenue for the development of advanced superconducting technologies. However, further research is needed to overcome the challenges associated with these materials and to fully understand their behavior under different conditions.

#### 3.3b Thermoelectric effects in superconductors

Thermoelectric effects in superconductors are a fascinating area of study that has significant implications for energy conversion and cooling technologies. These effects are a direct result of the unique properties of superconductors, particularly their ability to conduct electricity without any resistance.

##### Thermoelectric Cooling

Thermoelectric cooling is a method of cooling that uses the Seebeck effect to create a temperature difference between two different materials. This temperature difference can then be used to cool a system. In superconductors, the Peltier effect can be used to create this temperature difference, making them ideal for thermoelectric cooling applications.

The Peltier effect is a direct consequence of the Josephson effect, which allows for the flow of supercurrents across Josephson junctions. When a voltage is applied across these junctions, a supercurrent can flow, and the heat generated by this current can be used to create a temperature difference. This effect can be described by the following equation:

$$
\Delta T = \frac{1}{2} \frac{I_c R_n}{\kappa}
$$

where $\Delta T$ is the temperature difference, $I_c$ is the critical current, $R_n$ is the normal resistance, and $\kappa$ is the thermal conductivity.

##### Thermoelectric Power Generation

Thermoelectric power generation is another important application of superconductors. This process involves the conversion of heat energy into electrical energy using the Seebeck effect. In superconductors, this effect can be enhanced due to the high critical currents that can be achieved.

The Seebeck effect is a result of the difference in electrical potential between two different materials. In superconductors, this difference can be increased by increasing the temperature difference between the two materials. This can be achieved by using the Peltier effect to create a temperature difference, as described above.

##### Thermoelectric Cooling and Power Generation in Type-II Superconductors

Type-II superconductors, due to their ability to trap magnetic fields, are particularly well-suited for thermoelectric applications. The trapped magnetic fields can be used to create strong vortices, which can enhance the thermoelectric effects described above.

In addition, the strong vortex pinning that occurs in type-II superconductors can lead to high critical currents, which can further enhance the thermoelectric effects. This makes type-II superconductors a promising material for future thermoelectric technologies.

In conclusion, thermoelectric effects in superconductors offer a promising avenue for the development of advanced energy conversion and cooling technologies. The unique properties of superconductors, particularly their ability to conduct electricity without any resistance, make them ideal for these applications.

Superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) are a type of superconducting device that exploits the quantum mechanical properties of superconductors. They are used in a variety of applications, including high-resolution magnetometers, magnetic field imaging, and quantum computing.

##### Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices

SQUIDs are essentially superconducting circuits that exhibit quantum interference. They are typically made from Josephson junctions, which are superconducting devices that exhibit the Josephson effect. The Josephson effect allows for the flow of supercurrents across these junctions, and it is this effect that underlies the operation of SQUIDs.

The operation of a SQUID can be understood in terms of the Josephson relation, which states that the supercurrent flowing across a Josephson junction is given by:

$$
I = I_c \sin(\varphi)
$$

where $I$ is the supercurrent, $I_c$ is the critical current, and $\varphi$ is the phase difference across the junction. This relation allows for the manipulation of the supercurrent by controlling the phase difference, which is what is done in a SQUID.

##### Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices in Type-II Superconductors

Type-II superconductors, due to their ability to trap magnetic fields, are particularly well-suited for SQUID applications. The trapped magnetic fields can be used to create strong vortices, which can enhance the quantum interference effects described above.

In addition, the strong vortex pinning that occurs in type-II superconductors can lead to high critical currents, which can further enhance the quantum interference effects. This makes type-II superconductors a promising material for future SQUID technologies.

#### 3.3b Flux pinning and critical current density

Flux pinning is a crucial phenomenon in type-II superconductors that allows them to trap magnetic fields. This property is not possible with type-I superconductors, which cannot be penetrated by magnetic fields. The ability of type-II superconductors to pin flux is a result of their unique behavior when subjected to a magnetic field.

#### Critical Current Density and Flux Pinning

The critical current density, $J_c$, is a key parameter in superconductivity that represents the maximum current density a superconductor can carry without losing its superconducting state. In type-II superconductors, the critical current density is influenced by the phenomenon of flux pinning.

When a type-II superconductor is subjected to a magnetic field, the magnetic field lines are pinned to certain locations within the superconductor. These pinned locations, known as flux pinning centers, prevent the magnetic field lines from moving within the superconductor. This pinning effect increases the critical current density of the superconductor, allowing it to carry higher currents without losing its superconducting state.

The critical current density can be expressed as:

$$
J_c = J_{c0} \exp \left( - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)
$$

where $J_{c0}$ is the critical current density in the absence of flux pinning. This equation shows that the critical current density increases with the strength of the pinning force, which is proportional to the square root of the applied magnetic field.

#### Importance of Flux Pinning and Critical Current Density

The ability of type-II superconductors to pin flux and increase their critical current density has significant implications for their practical applications. For instance, in high-temperature ceramic superconductors, flux creep can degrade the superconductor's properties and reduce its critical current density. However, the pinning of flux can prevent this degradation and maintain the superconductor's critical current density.

In addition, the critical current density is a key parameter in the design of superconducting devices. Devices such as superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) and superconducting quantum interference filters (SQIFs) rely on the high critical current densities of type-II superconductors to operate. Understanding the relationship between flux pinning and critical current density is therefore crucial for the design and optimization of these devices.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical models that describe the behavior of type-II superconductors under a magnetic field, including the Ginzburg-Landau theory and the London equations.

#### 3.3c Thermal stability and critical current density

The critical current density, $J_c$, is not only influenced by flux pinning but also by thermal stability. The thermal stability of a superconductor refers to its ability to maintain its superconducting state under varying temperature conditions. 

#### Thermal Stability and Critical Current Density

Thermal stability is a crucial factor in determining the critical current density of a superconductor. As the temperature of a superconductor increases, the thermal energy can disrupt the superconducting state, leading to a decrease in the critical current density. This is because the thermal energy can break the Cooper pairs, which are responsible for the superconducting state.

The critical current density can be expressed as:

$$
J_c = J_{c0} \exp \left( - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \exp \left( - \frac{T - T_c}{T_m} \right)
$$

where $J_{c0}$ is the critical current density in the absence of thermal effects, $T$ is the temperature, $T_c$ is the critical temperature, and $T_m$ is the thermal stability parameter. This equation shows that the critical current density decreases with increasing temperature and decreasing thermal stability.

#### Importance of Thermal Stability and Critical Current Density

The thermal stability and critical current density of a superconductor are crucial for its practical applications. For instance, in high-temperature superconductors, the thermal stability can be a limiting factor in achieving high critical current densities. This is because the thermal stability decreases with increasing temperature, which can limit the maximum achievable critical current density.

In addition, the thermal stability is a key parameter in the design of superconducting devices. Devices such as superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) and superconducting quantum interference filters (SQIFs) require high critical current densities and thermal stability to operate. Understanding the relationship between thermal stability and critical current density is therefore crucial for the design and optimization of these devices.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical models that describe the behavior of type-II superconductors under varying temperature conditions, including the Ginzburg-Landau theory and the London equations.

#### 3.3c Superconducting thermoelectric effects

Superconducting thermoelectric effects are a fascinating area of study that combines the principles of superconductivity and thermoelectricity. These effects are particularly relevant in the context of type-II superconductors, where the ability to pin flux can lead to unique thermoelectric properties.

#### Superconducting Thermoelectric Effects in Type-II Superconductors

In type-II superconductors, the presence of a magnetic field can lead to the formation of vortices. These vortices, which are regions of superconductivity surrounded by a ring of normal conductivity, can act as scattering centers for electrons. This scattering can lead to an increase in the electrical resistivity of the superconductor, a phenomenon known as the vortex resistivity.

However, when a temperature gradient is applied across the superconductor, the vortices can move in response to the temperature change. This movement can lead to a change in the electrical resistivity, which can be used to generate an electric current. This effect is known as the thermoelectric effect.

The thermoelectric effect in type-II superconductors can be described by the Seebeck coefficient, $\alpha_{S}$, which is a measure of the voltage generated by a temperature difference across the superconductor. The Seebeck coefficient can be expressed as:

$$
\alpha_{S} = - \frac{1}{T} \frac{\partial \Delta \mu}{\partial T}
$$

where $\Delta \mu$ is the chemical potential difference across the superconductor, and $T$ is the temperature.

#### Superconducting Thermoelectric Effects in Thermal Copper Pillar Bumps

The thermal copper pillar bump (TCPB) is a type of thermoelectric device that utilizes the principles of superconductivity and thermoelectricity. The TCPB is structurally identical to a standard copper pillar bump, with the addition of a thermoelectric layer sandwiched between two solder layers.

When a voltage is applied to the TCPB, a current is generated due to the Seebeck effect. This current can be used to power electronic devices. Conversely, if heat is applied to one side of the TCPB, a voltage is generated due to the Peltier effect, which can be used to cool electronic devices.

The TCPB can operate in both the Peltier and Seebeck modes, though not simultaneously. This makes it a versatile and efficient thermoelectric device, with potential applications in a wide range of fields, from power generation to cooling of electronic devices.

In conclusion, superconducting thermoelectric effects, particularly in type-II superconductors and thermal copper pillar bumps, offer exciting possibilities for the development of efficient and versatile thermoelectric devices. Further research in this area could lead to significant advancements in the field of applied superconductivity.

## Chapter: Superconducting quantum interference devices

### Introduction

Superconducting quantum interference devices, or SQUIDs, are a class of superconducting devices that exploit the quantum mechanical properties of superconductors to perform a variety of functions. These devices are of particular interest due to their sensitivity to magnetic fields, their ability to operate at extremely low temperatures, and their potential applications in quantum computing.

In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of SQUIDs, exploring their unique properties and the principles behind their operation. We will begin by discussing the basics of superconductivity and how it differs from normal conductivity. We will then move on to the quantum mechanical phenomena that are exploited in SQUIDs, such as the Josephson effect and the Meissner effect.

Next, we will introduce the concept of a SQUID and discuss its basic structure. We will explain how the superconducting properties of the SQUID allow it to detect extremely small magnetic fields, and how this property can be used in a variety of applications, from medical imaging to geophysical exploration.

This will allow us to express complex concepts in a clear and concise manner.

#### 3.4a Upper and lower critical fields

The critical fields of a superconductor are the upper and lower critical fields, denoted as $H_{c2}$ and $H_{c1}$, respectively. These fields represent the boundaries of the superconducting state, beyond which the superconductor transitions into a normal conducting state.

The upper critical field, $H_{c2}$, is the maximum magnetic field that a superconductor can withstand while maintaining superconductivity. Above this field, the superconductor loses its superconducting properties due to the increasing energy cost of creating and maintaining Cooper pairs. The upper critical field is typically dependent on the temperature, with a higher temperature leading to a lower upper critical field.

The lower critical field, $H_{c1}$, is the minimum magnetic field that a superconductor can withstand while maintaining superconductivity. Below this field, the superconductor is in the Meissner state, where all magnetic fields are expelled from the superconductor. The lower critical field is typically dependent on the temperature, with a lower temperature leading to a higher lower critical field.

The critical fields of a superconductor can be calculated using the Ginzburg-Landau theory, which provides a mathematical description of the superconducting state. The theory is based on the concept of the order parameter, $\psi$, which represents the degree of superconductivity in a given region. The critical fields are then given by the equations:

$$
H_{c1} = \frac{\hbar c}{2e} \left( \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \right)^{1/2} \frac{1}{\xi(0)}
$$

$$
H_{c2} = \frac{\hbar c}{2e} \left( \frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \right)^{1/2} \frac{1}{\xi(0)} \tanh \left( \frac{1.74 \hbar \omega_c}{\Delta(0)} \right)
$$

where $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, $e$ is the elementary charge, $m$ is the electron mass, $\xi(0)$ is the coherence length, $\omega_c$ is the cyclotron frequency, and $\Delta(0)$ is the energy gap at zero temperature.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of flux flow and its implications for superconductivity.

#### 3.4b Flux pinning and creep

Flux pinning is a critical phenomenon in superconductivity that occurs when magnetic flux lines become trapped in the superconductor, preventing them from expulsion. This phenomenon is particularly important in high-temperature superconductors, where the upper critical field $H_{c2}$ is often exceeded in practical applications.

The concept of flux pinning can be understood in the context of the Ginzburg-Landau theory. As the magnetic field increases beyond the lower critical field $H_{c1}$, the superconductor transitions from the Meissner state to the mixed state, where some of the magnetic field is allowed to penetrate the superconductor. In this state, the magnetic flux lines are confined to narrow regions, known as vortices, where the superconductivity is suppressed.

However, in high-temperature superconductors, these vortices can become unstable and start to move under the influence of the applied magnetic field. This phenomenon is known as flux creep. The movement of vortices can lead to a gradual increase in the electrical resistance of the superconductor, which can limit the practical applications of high-temperature superconductors.

To prevent flux creep, it is necessary to pin the vortices in place. This can be achieved by introducing defects or impurities in the superconductor, which can act as pinning centers for the vortices. These pinning centers can hinder the movement of vortices, thereby reducing the effects of flux creep.

The critical current density $J_c$ in a superconductor is a key parameter that determines its ability to carry current without resistance. In the presence of a magnetic field, the critical current density can be expressed as:

$$
J_c = J_{c0} \tanh \left( \frac{H}{H_{c1}} \right) \exp \left( - \frac{H_{c2} - H}{H_{c2} - H_{c1}} \right)
$$

where $J_{c0}$ is the critical current density at zero magnetic field, $H$ is the applied magnetic field, and $H_{c1}$ and $H_{c2}$ are the lower and upper critical fields, respectively. This equation shows that the critical current density decreases with increasing magnetic field, which is a direct consequence of flux pinning and creep.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of critical current density and its implications for superconductivity.

#### 3.4c Critical current density and critical state

The critical current density $J_c$ is a fundamental parameter in superconductivity that represents the maximum current density a superconductor can carry without losing its superconducting properties. It is a critical parameter in the design and operation of superconducting devices.

The critical current density is influenced by several factors, including the applied magnetic field, the temperature, and the material properties of the superconductor. In the presence of a magnetic field, the critical current density can be expressed as:

$$
J_c = J_{c0} \tanh \left( \frac{H}{H_{c1}} \right) \exp \left( - \frac{H_{c2} - H}{H_{c2} - H_{c1}} \right)
$$

where $J_{c0}$ is the critical current density at zero magnetic field, $H$ is the applied magnetic field, and $H_{c1}$ and $H_{c2}$ are the lower and upper critical fields, respectively. This equation shows that the critical current density decreases with increasing magnetic field, which is a direct consequence of flux pinning and creep.

The critical state of a superconductor refers to the state of the superconductor when it is carrying the critical current. In this state, the superconductor is at the boundary between the superconducting and normal states. The critical state is characterized by the presence of vortices, which are regions where the superconductivity is suppressed.

The critical state can be described by the critical state model, which is a phenomenological model that describes the behavior of a superconductor in the critical state. The model is based on the concept of the critical state surface, which is a three-dimensional surface in the space of the applied magnetic field, the current density, and the temperature. The critical state surface separates the superconducting state from the normal state.

The critical state model provides a useful framework for understanding the behavior of superconductors in the critical state. However, it is important to note that the model is based on several simplifying assumptions, and its predictions may not always be accurate. Therefore, it is important to validate the predictions of the model with experimental data.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of critical state and its implications for superconductivity.

#### 3.4b Flux flow and resistive transitions

In the previous section, we discussed the critical fields of a superconductor, $H_{c1}$ and $H_{c2}$. These fields represent the boundaries of the superconducting state, beyond which the superconductor transitions into a normal conducting state. However, in practical applications, superconductors often operate in the presence of a magnetic field, and the superconducting state can be perturbed by this field. This can lead to a phenomenon known as flux flow, where the superconductor transitions from a perfect diamagnetism (Meissner state) to a mixed state, and finally to a normal conducting state.

Flux flow occurs when the magnetic field exceeds the lower critical field, $H_{c1}$. In this regime, the superconductor can no longer expel all magnetic fields, and some magnetic lines of force penetrate the superconductor. This leads to the formation of vortices, where the superconducting current circulates around a central core. The vortices can be thought of as "flux lines" or "flux tubes", and their density increases with increasing magnetic field.

As the magnetic field increases further, the vortices start to interact with each other, leading to a decrease in the superconducting current. This is because the vortices hinder the movement of Cooper pairs, which are responsible for the superconducting current. As a result, the superconductor transitions from a perfect diamagnetism (Meissner state) to a mixed state, where some magnetic fields are expelled and some are allowed to penetrate the superconductor.

Finally, when the magnetic field exceeds the upper critical field, $H_{c2}$, the superconductor transitions into a normal conducting state. In this state, the superconducting current is no longer zero, and the superconductor behaves like a normal conductor.

The transition from the Meissner state to the mixed state is characterized by a resistive transition. This is because the superconductor starts to exhibit a finite resistance as the magnetic field increases. The resistive transition can be observed in the form of a voltage-magnetic field ($V-H$) curve, which typically shows a step-like increase in voltage as the magnetic field increases.

The study of flux flow and resistive transitions is crucial for understanding the behavior of superconductors in practical applications. It allows us to predict the critical fields and the onset of the mixed state, and to design superconducting devices that can operate in the presence of a magnetic field.

#### 3.4c Pinning and creep

In the previous section, we discussed the phenomenon of flux flow and its implications for superconductors. We saw that as the magnetic field increases, the superconductor transitions from a perfect diamagnetism (Meissner state) to a mixed state, and finally to a normal conducting state. This transition is characterized by a resistive transition, which can be observed in the form of a voltage-magnetic field ($V-H$) curve.

However, in practical applications, superconductors often operate in the presence of a constant magnetic field. In such cases, the superconductor can remain in the mixed state for a long time, even after the magnetic field has exceeded the upper critical field, $H_{c2}$. This is due to a phenomenon known as pinning.

Pinning occurs when the vortices in the superconductor become "pinned" to defects or impurities in the material. These defects or impurities act as obstacles for the vortices, preventing them from moving and allowing the superconductor to remain in the mixed state. This can significantly increase the critical current density, $J_c$, of the superconductor.

However, even with pinning, the superconductor will eventually transition into a normal conducting state. This is due to a phenomenon known as creep. Creep is a slow, time-dependent process where the superconductor gradually transitions from the mixed state to the normal state. This is because the vortices in the superconductor are not completely pinned, and can slowly move under the influence of thermal fluctuations.

The time dependence of creep can be described by the Arrhenius law, which states that the creep rate is proportional to the exponential of the inverse temperature. This means that at higher temperatures, the creep rate is faster, and the superconductor will transition into the normal state more quickly.

In conclusion, pinning and creep are important phenomena that can significantly affect the behavior of superconductors in practical applications. Understanding these phenomena is crucial for designing and optimizing superconducting devices.

## Chapter: Superconducting quantum interference devices

### Introduction

Superconducting quantum interference devices, or SQUIDs, are a class of devices that exploit the quantum mechanical properties of superconductors to perform a variety of measurements. These devices have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of quantum mechanics and have found applications in a wide range of fields, from medical imaging to geophysical exploration.

In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of SQUIDs, exploring their principles of operation, their construction, and their applications. We will begin by introducing the basic concepts of superconductivity and quantum mechanics that are necessary to understand SQUIDs. We will then move on to discuss the different types of SQUIDs, including single-junction SQUIDs, double-junction SQUIDs, and multi-junction SQUIDs. We will also cover the fabrication techniques used to create these devices, including electron beam lithography and ion beam milling.

Next, we will explore the applications of SQUIDs. These include their use in extremely sensitive magnetometers, their role in quantum computing, and their application in biomagnetic imaging. We will also discuss the challenges and future prospects of SQUID technology.

Finally, we will conclude the chapter with a discussion on the future of SQUIDs. This will include a look at the latest developments in the field, as well as a discussion on the potential future applications of SQUIDs.

So, let's embark on this journey into the quantum world of SQUIDs, where the laws of classical physics often give way to the strange and fascinating phenomena of quantum mechanics.




#### 3.4c Vortex pinning and creep

As we have seen in the previous section, the presence of a magnetic field can lead to the formation of vortices in a superconductor. These vortices can interact with each other and hinder the movement of Cooper pairs, leading to a decrease in the superconducting current. However, in some cases, the vortices can become "pinned" to the superconductor's lattice structure, preventing them from moving and allowing the superconductor to maintain its superconducting state even in the presence of a magnetic field.

Vortex pinning occurs when the vortices become trapped in the lattice structure of the superconductor. This can happen due to defects in the lattice, impurities, or other irregularities. Once pinned, the vortices cannot move, and the superconductor can maintain its superconducting state even in the presence of a magnetic field.

However, even with vortex pinning, the superconductor can still exhibit a phenomenon known as vortex creep. Vortex creep is a slow, non-equilibrium process where vortices move through the superconductor, leading to a decrease in the superconducting current. This process is driven by thermal fluctuations and can occur even when the superconductor is at zero temperature.

The rate of vortex creep is determined by the activation energy, $E_a$, and the temperature, $T$. The activation energy is the minimum energy required to move a vortex through the superconductor, and it is typically on the order of $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-6}$ eV. The temperature, on the other hand, affects the rate of thermal fluctuations, which drive the vortex creep process.

The vortex creep process can be described by the Arrhenius equation:

$$
J = J_0 \exp\left(-\frac{E_a}{k_B T}\right)
$$

where $J$ is the current density, $J_0$ is the current density at zero temperature, $E_a$ is the activation energy, $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant, and $T$ is the temperature.

In the next section, we will discuss the effects of vortex pinning and creep on the critical fields of a superconductor.




#### 3.5a Ginzburg-Landau equations

The Ginzburg-Landau theory is a phenomenological theory that describes the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature. It was first proposed by Lev Landau and Vitaly Ginzburg in 1950 and is based on the concept of order parameter, which is a complex-valued function that describes the state of a superconductor.

The Ginzburg-Landau theory is based on the following assumptions:

1. The order parameter, denoted by $\psi$, is a complex-valued function that describes the state of a superconductor. It is zero in the normal state and non-zero in the superconducting state.
2. The order parameter is a smooth function that varies continuously across the superconductor.
3. The order parameter is affected by the external magnetic field and the temperature.

Based on these assumptions, the Ginzburg-Landau theory can be used to derive the Ginzburg-Landau equations, which describe the behavior of the order parameter in a superconductor. These equations are given by:

$$
\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = -\alpha \psi + \beta |\psi|^2 \psi + \gamma \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2} + \delta \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial y^2} + \epsilon \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial z^2}
$$

where $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\delta$, and $\epsilon$ are constants, and $t$, $x$, $y$, and $z$ are time and space coordinates, respectively.

The Ginzburg-Landau equations describe the dynamics of the order parameter in a superconductor. The first term on the right-hand side represents the dissipation of the order parameter due to thermal fluctuations. The second term represents the nonlinear interaction between the order parameter and the external magnetic field. The third and fourth terms represent the spatial variation of the order parameter, and the last term represents the temporal variation of the order parameter.

The Ginzburg-Landau equations can be used to study the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature. They can also be used to understand the effects of external magnetic fields and temperature on the superconducting state. However, it is important to note that the Ginzburg-Landau theory is a phenomenological theory and does not provide a microscopic explanation for superconductivity.

#### 3.5b Ginzburg-Landau theory in superconductivity

The Ginzburg-Landau theory is particularly useful in understanding the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature. As the temperature approaches the critical temperature, the order parameter becomes smaller and the superconductor transitions from the superconducting state to the normal state. The Ginzburg-Landau theory can be used to describe this transition and the behavior of the superconductor near the critical temperature.

The Ginzburg-Landau theory also provides a way to understand the effects of external magnetic fields on superconductors. The second term on the right-hand side of the Ginzburg-Landau equations represents the nonlinear interaction between the order parameter and the external magnetic field. This term can lead to the formation of vortices in the superconductor, which can significantly affect the behavior of the superconductor.

The Ginzburg-Landau theory can also be used to understand the effects of temperature on superconductors. The first term on the right-hand side of the Ginzburg-Landau equations represents the dissipation of the order parameter due to thermal fluctuations. This term can lead to the destruction of the superconducting state at temperatures above the critical temperature.

In conclusion, the Ginzburg-Landau theory is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature. It provides a way to understand the effects of external magnetic fields and temperature on superconductors, and can be used to derive the Ginzburg-Landau equations, which describe the behavior of the order parameter in a superconductor.

#### 3.5c Ginzburg-Landau theory in superconductivity

The Ginzburg-Landau theory is not only useful in understanding the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature, but it also provides a framework for understanding the behavior of superconductors in the presence of external magnetic fields. The Ginzburg-Landau theory can be used to derive the Ginzburg-Landau equations, which describe the behavior of the order parameter in a superconductor.

The Ginzburg-Landau equations are given by:

$$
\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = -\alpha \psi + \beta |\psi|^2 \psi + \gamma \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2} + \delta \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial y^2} + \epsilon \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial z^2}
$$

where $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\delta$, and $\epsilon$ are constants, and $t$, $x$, $y$, and $z$ are time and space coordinates, respectively.

The first term on the right-hand side of the Ginzburg-Landau equations represents the dissipation of the order parameter due to thermal fluctuations. The second term represents the nonlinear interaction between the order parameter and the external magnetic field. The third and fourth terms represent the spatial variation of the order parameter, and the last term represents the temporal variation of the order parameter.

The Ginzburg-Landau theory can be used to understand the effects of external magnetic fields on superconductors. The second term on the right-hand side of the Ginzburg-Landau equations represents the nonlinear interaction between the order parameter and the external magnetic field. This term can lead to the formation of vortices in the superconductor, which can significantly affect the behavior of the superconductor.

The Ginzburg-Landau theory can also be used to understand the effects of temperature on superconductors. The first term on the right-hand side of the Ginzburg-Landau equations represents the dissipation of the order parameter due to thermal fluctuations. This term can lead to the destruction of the superconducting state at temperatures above the critical temperature.

In conclusion, the Ginzburg-Landau theory is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature and in the presence of external magnetic fields. It provides a way to understand the effects of temperature and external magnetic fields on superconductors, and can be used to derive the Ginzburg-Landau equations, which describe the behavior of the order parameter in a superconductor.

## Chapter 4: Superconducting quantum interference devices

### Introduction

Superconducting quantum interference devices, or SQUIDs, are a class of superconducting devices that exploit the quantum mechanical properties of superconductors. They are designed to be highly sensitive to magnetic fields, and are used in a variety of applications, from medical imaging to geophysical exploration.

In this chapter, we will delve into the fascinating world of SQUIDs, exploring their principles of operation, their design, and their applications.

#### 3.5b Order parameter and coherence length

The order parameter, denoted by $\psi$, is a complex-valued function that describes the state of a superconductor. It is zero in the normal state and non-zero in the superconducting state. The order parameter is affected by the external magnetic field and the temperature, and it varies continuously across the superconductor.

The coherence length, denoted by $\xi$, is a measure of the spatial extent over which the order parameter is coherent. In other words, it is the distance over which the order parameter remains constant. The coherence length is a crucial parameter in the Ginzburg-Landau theory as it determines the behavior of the superconductor near the critical temperature.

The coherence length can be calculated using the Ginzburg-Landau equations. The equation for the coherence length is given by:

$$
\xi = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha^2 + \beta |\psi|^2}}
$$

where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are constants, and $|\psi|^2$ is the magnitude of the order parameter.

The coherence length is inversely proportional to the square root of the sum of the squares of the constants $\alpha$ and $\beta$. This means that as the temperature approaches the critical temperature, the coherence length decreases. This is because the term $\beta |\psi|^2$ becomes smaller as the temperature increases, and the term $\alpha^2$ remains constant.

The coherence length is also affected by the external magnetic field. As the magnetic field increases, the term $\beta |\psi|^2$ decreases, and the coherence length decreases. This is because the magnetic field disrupts the superconducting state, reducing the magnitude of the order parameter.

The coherence length is a crucial parameter in the Ginzburg-Landau theory as it determines the behavior of the superconductor near the critical temperature. It is also a key factor in the design and operation of superconducting devices. For example, in superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), the coherence length must be long enough to allow for the interference of the superconducting wave functions.

In the next section, we will discuss the Ginzburg-Landau theory in more detail and explore its applications in superconductivity.

#### 3.5c Ginzburg-Landau theory and phase transitions

The Ginzburg-Landau theory is a phenomenological theory that describes the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature. It is based on the concept of order parameter, which is a complex-valued function that describes the state of a superconductor. The theory is particularly useful in understanding phase transitions, which are sudden changes in the state of a system as a function of a control parameter.

In the context of superconductivity, the control parameter is the temperature. As the temperature approaches the critical temperature, the order parameter changes from zero in the normal state to a non-zero value in the superconducting state. This change is accompanied by a phase transition, where the superconductor transitions from a normal state to a superconducting state.

The Ginzburg-Landau theory provides a mathematical framework for describing this phase transition. The theory is based on the Ginzburg-Landau equations, which describe the dynamics of the order parameter in a superconductor. These equations are given by:

$$
\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t} = -\alpha \psi + \beta |\psi|^2 \psi + \gamma \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial x^2} + \delta \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial y^2} + \epsilon \frac{\partial^2 \psi}{\partial z^2}
$$

where $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\delta$, and $\epsilon$ are constants, and $\psi$ is the order parameter.

The Ginzburg-Landau equations describe the behavior of the order parameter in a superconductor. The first term on the right-hand side represents the dissipation of the order parameter due to thermal fluctuations. The second term represents the nonlinear interaction between the order parameter and the external magnetic field. The third and fourth terms represent the spatial variation of the order parameter, and the last term represents the temporal variation of the order parameter.

The Ginzburg-Landau theory also provides a way to calculate the coherence length, which is a measure of the spatial extent over which the order parameter is coherent. The coherence length is a crucial parameter in the Ginzburg-Landau theory as it determines the behavior of the superconductor near the critical temperature.

In the next section, we will discuss the Ginzburg-Landau theory in more detail and explore its applications in superconductivity.

#### 3.5c Phase transitions in superconductors

The Ginzburg-Landau theory is a phenomenological theory that describes the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature. It is based on the concept of an order parameter, which is a complex-valued function that describes the state of a superconductor. The theory is named after the Russian physicists Lev Ginzburg and Vitaly Landau, who first proposed it in 1950.

The Ginzburg-Landau theory is particularly useful in understanding the phase transitions that occur in superconductors. A phase transition is a sudden change in the state of a system, from one phase to another. In the case of superconductors, the phase transition occurs when the system transitions from the normal state (where the order parameter is zero) to the superconducting state (where the order parameter is non-zero).

The Ginzburg-Landau theory describes this phase transition in terms of the order parameter. Near the critical temperature, the order parameter is small and the system is in the normal state. As the temperature decreases below the critical temperature, the order parameter increases and the system transitions into the superconducting state.

The Ginzburg-Landau theory also introduces the concept of the coherence length, which is a measure of the spatial extent over which the order parameter is coherent. As the temperature approaches the critical temperature, the coherence length decreases, indicating that the order parameter is less coherent over larger distances.

The Ginzburg-Landau theory is a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of superconductors near the critical temperature. It has been used to predict the properties of superconductors, such as the critical temperature and the coherence length, and has been confirmed by numerous experimental observations. However, it is important to note that the Ginzburg-Landau theory is a phenomenological theory, and it is not applicable to all types of superconductors. In particular, it is not applicable to high-temperature superconductors, which exhibit a different type of phase transition.

### Section: 4.1 BCS I:

#### 4.1a Electron-phonon interaction

The electron-phonon interaction is a fundamental concept in the study of superconductivity. It describes the interaction between electrons and lattice vibrations, or phonons, in a material. This interaction is crucial in the formation of Cooper pairs, which are the fundamental building blocks of superconductivity.

The electron-phonon interaction can be described by the following Hamiltonian:

$$
H_\text{el} = \sum_{\mathbf{k},\mathbf{q}} g_{\mathbf{k},\mathbf{q}} c_{\mathbf{k}+\mathbf{q}}^\dagger c_{\mathbf{k}} \left( b_{\mathbf{q}} + b_{-\mathbf{q}}^\dagger \right)
$$

where $c_{\mathbf{k}}$ and $c_{\mathbf{k}}^\dagger$ are the annihilation and creation operators for an electron with momentum $\mathbf{k}$, $b_{\mathbf{q}}$ and $b_{\mathbf{q}}^\dagger$ are the annihilation and creation operators for a phonon with momentum $\mathbf{q}$, and $g_{\mathbf{k},\mathbf{q}}$ is the electron-phonon coupling constant.

The electron-phonon coupling constant $g_{\mathbf{k},\mathbf{q}}$ is a crucial parameter in the electron-phonon interaction. It describes the strength of the interaction between an electron and a phonon. The coupling constant is typically dependent on the momentum of the electron and the phonon, as well as the material properties of the material.

The electron-phonon interaction can lead to the formation of Cooper pairs, which are pairs of electrons with opposite spin and momentum. These pairs are formed due to the attractive interaction between the electrons and the phonons. The formation of Cooper pairs is a key mechanism in the onset of superconductivity.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the Cooper problem and explore the various theories that have been proposed to explain why superconductivity occurs only below a certain critical temperature.

#### 4.1b Cooper problem and BCS theory

The Cooper problem, named after physicist Leon Cooper, is a fundamental question in the field of superconductivity. It asks why superconductivity occurs only below a certain critical temperature, known as the transition temperature. This question was answered by Cooper and John Bardeen, along with Leon Cooper, in their development of the BCS theory.

The BCS theory, or the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory, is a microscopic theory that explains the phenomenon of superconductivity. It is based on the concept of Cooper pairs, which are pairs of electrons with opposite spin and momentum. These pairs are formed due to the attractive interaction between the electrons and the phonons, as described by the electron-phonon interaction Hamiltonian.

The BCS theory explains the onset of superconductivity as follows: at temperatures below the transition temperature, the attractive interaction between the electrons and the phonons leads to the formation of Cooper pairs. These pairs have a lower energy than the individual electrons, and they occupy the lowest energy levels. This results in a decrease in the density of states at the Fermi level, which leads to the onset of superconductivity.

The BCS theory also explains the Meissner effect, which is the expulsion of magnetic fields from the interior of a superconductor. According to the theory, the Cooper pairs have a zero net momentum, and they respond to an external magnetic field by moving in such a way that they create a counteracting magnetic field. This results in the expulsion of the magnetic field from the interior of the superconductor.

The BCS theory has been successful in explaining many of the properties of superconductors, including the Meissner effect, the energy gap, and the critical temperature. However, it has some limitations, such as the assumption of a one-dimensional lattice and the neglect of electron-electron interactions. These limitations have led to the development of more advanced theories, such as the Eliashberg theory and the renormalization group theory.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the BCS theory and explore its implications for the behavior of superconductors.

#### 4.1c BCS ground state and Cooper pairs

The BCS theory not only explains the onset of superconductivity but also provides a detailed understanding of the ground state of a superconductor. The ground state, or the lowest energy state, of a superconductor is characterized by the formation of Cooper pairs.

In the BCS theory, the ground state is described by the wave function:

$$
\Psi_0 = \prod_{\mathbf{k}} (u_{\mathbf{k}} + v_{\mathbf{k}} c_{\mathbf{k}}^\dagger c_{-\mathbf{k}}^\dagger) |0\rangle
$$

where $u_{\mathbf{k}}$ and $v_{\mathbf{k}}$ are complex numbers, $c_{\mathbf{k}}$ and $c_{\mathbf{k}}^\dagger$ are the annihilation and creation operators for an electron with momentum $\mathbf{k}$, and $|0\rangle$ is the vacuum state. The coefficients $u_{\mathbf{k}}$ and $v_{\mathbf{k}}$ are determined by the minimization of the total energy of the system.

The ground state wave function describes a state with Cooper pairs, where each pair consists of an electron with momentum $\mathbf{k}$ and a hole with momentum $-\mathbf{k}$. The holes are created by the action of the creation operators $c_{-\mathbf{k}}^\dagger$ on the vacuum state.

The formation of Cooper pairs leads to a decrease in the total energy of the system. This is because the Cooper pairs have a lower energy than the individual electrons, and they occupy the lowest energy levels. This results in a decrease in the density of states at the Fermi level, which leads to the onset of superconductivity.

The BCS ground state also explains the Meissner effect. The Cooper pairs have a zero net momentum, and they respond to an external magnetic field by moving in such a way that they create a counteracting magnetic field. This results in the expulsion of the magnetic field from the interior of the superconductor.

In the next section, we will explore the implications of the BCS ground state for the behavior of superconductors.




### Section: 4.1 BCS I:

#### 4.1b Cooper instability

The Cooper instability, named after physicist Leon Cooper, is a fundamental concept in the study of superconductivity. It describes the instability that occurs when the attractive interaction between electrons and phonons leads to the formation of Cooper pairs.

The Cooper instability can be understood in terms of the BCS theory, which describes the formation of Cooper pairs as a result of the attractive interaction between electrons and phonons. The BCS theory is based on the following assumptions:

1. The electrons and phonons interact with each other through the electron-phonon interaction.
2. The electrons and phonons are in thermal equilibrium at a temperature $T$.
3. The electrons and phonons are in a state of quantum statistics, with the electrons being fermions and the phonons being bosons.

The Cooper instability occurs when the attractive interaction between the electrons and phonons leads to the formation of Cooper pairs. This occurs when the temperature $T$ is below the critical temperature $T_c$, at which the attractive interaction between the electrons and phonons becomes stronger than the repulsive interaction between the electrons.

The Cooper instability can be described by the following equation:

$$
\Delta(T) = \Delta(0) \tanh \left( \frac{1.74 \hbar \omega_c}{2\Delta(0)} \right) \tanh \left( \frac{1.74 \hbar \omega_c}{2\Delta(T)} \right) \tanh \left( \frac{1.74 \hbar \omega_c}{2\Delta(T)} \right)
$$

where $\Delta(T)$ is the energy gap, $\Delta(0)$ is the energy gap at $T=0$, and $\omega_c$ is the characteristic frequency of the system.

The Cooper instability leads to the formation of Cooper pairs, which are pairs of electrons with opposite spin and momentum. These pairs are formed due to the attractive interaction between the electrons and the phonons. The formation of Cooper pairs is a key mechanism in the onset of superconductivity.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the Cooper problem and explore the various theories that have been proposed to explain why superconductivity occurs only below a certain critical temperature.

#### 4.1c BCS ground state

The BCS ground state, named after physicists John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Schrieffer, is the lowest energy state of a superconducting system. It is the state in which all the electrons are paired up in Cooper pairs, and the system is in a state of superconductivity.

The BCS ground state can be understood in terms of the BCS theory, which describes the formation of Cooper pairs as a result of the attractive interaction between electrons and phonons. The BCS theory is based on the following assumptions:

1. The electrons and phonons interact with each other through the electron-phonon interaction.
2. The electrons and phonons are in thermal equilibrium at a temperature $T$.
3. The electrons and phonons are in a state of quantum statistics, with the electrons being fermions and the phonons being bosons.

The BCS ground state occurs when the attractive interaction between the electrons and phonons leads to the formation of Cooper pairs. This occurs when the temperature $T$ is below the critical temperature $T_c$, at which the attractive interaction between the electrons and phonons becomes stronger than the repulsive interaction between the electrons.

The BCS ground state can be described by the following equation:

$$
\Delta(T) = \Delta(0) \tanh \left( \frac{1.74 \hbar \omega_c}{2\Delta(0)} \right) \tanh \left( \frac{1.74 \hbar \omega_c}{2\Delta(T)} \right) \tanh \left( \frac{1.74 \hbar \omega_c}{2\Delta(T)} \right)
$$

where $\Delta(T)$ is the energy gap, $\Delta(0)$ is the energy gap at $T=0$, and $\omega_c$ is the characteristic frequency of the system.

The BCS ground state is a state of superconductivity, in which the electrons are paired up in Cooper pairs and the system is in a state of long-range order. This state is characterized by the Meissner effect, in which magnetic field lines are expelled from the system, and the London penetration depth, which describes the depth at which the magnetic field penetrates the system.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the BCS ground state and explore its properties and implications for superconductivity.

### Section: 4.1c BCS ground state

The BCS ground state, named after physicists John Bardeen, Leon Cooper, and John Schrieffer, is the lowest energy state of a superconductor. It is the state in which all the electrons are paired up, forming Cooper pairs, and the system is in a state of minimum energy.

The BCS ground state can be understood in terms of the BCS theory, which describes the formation of Cooper pairs as a result of the attractive interaction between electrons and phonons. The BCS theory is based on the following assumptions:

1. The electrons and phonons interact with each other through the electron-phonon interaction.
2. The electrons and phonons are in thermal equilibrium at a temperature $T$.
3. The electrons and phonons are in a state of quantum statistics, with the electrons being fermions and the phonons being bosons.

The BCS ground state occurs when the attractive interaction between the electrons and phonons leads to the formation of Cooper pairs. This occurs when the temperature $T$ is below the critical temperature $T_c$, at which the attractive interaction between the electrons and phonons becomes stronger than the repulsive interaction between the electrons.

The BCS ground state can be described by the following equation:

$$
\Delta(T) = \Delta(0) \tanh \left( \frac{1.74 \hbar \omega_c}{2\Delta(0)} \right) \tanh \left( \frac{1.74 \hbar \omega_c}{2\Delta(T)} \right) \tanh \left( \frac{1.74 \hbar \omega_c}{2\Delta(T)} \right)
$$

where $\Delta(T)$ is the energy gap, $\Delta(0)$ is the energy gap at $T=0$, and $\omega_c$ is the characteristic frequency of the system.

The BCS ground state is a state of minimum energy, as the formation of Cooper pairs reduces the kinetic energy of the electrons. This is because the Cooper pairs move through the lattice without scattering off impurities or lattice vibrations, which would increase their kinetic energy. This is in contrast to normal metals, where the electrons move through the lattice by scattering off impurities and lattice vibrations, which increases their kinetic energy.

The BCS ground state is also a state of zero resistance, as the Cooper pairs move through the lattice without scattering off impurities or lattice vibrations. This is in contrast to normal metals, where the electrons move through the lattice by scattering off impurities and lattice vibrations, which increases their resistance.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the properties of the BCS ground state and its implications for superconductivity.

## Chapter: Chapter 5: BCS II:

### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we introduced the fundamental concepts of superconductivity, including the BCS theory. We explored the formation of Cooper pairs and the role of phonons in the superconducting state. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the BCS theory, focusing on the second part of the theory.

The second part of the BCS theory is concerned with the behavior of superconductors at higher temperatures. As we have seen, the BCS theory predicts that superconductivity should occur at temperatures below the critical temperature $T_c$. However, the theory does not provide a clear explanation for the behavior of superconductors at temperatures close to $T_c$. This is where the second part of the BCS theory comes into play.

In this chapter, we will explore the behavior of superconductors at temperatures close to $T_c$. We will discuss the concept of the energy gap and its role in the superconducting state. We will also delve into the phenomenon of thermal fluctuations and their impact on the superconducting state.

We will also discuss the concept of the critical temperature $T_c$ and its significance in the BCS theory. We will explore how the critical temperature is determined by the balance between the attractive and repulsive interactions between electrons.

Finally, we will discuss the implications of the BCS theory for the design and development of superconducting devices. We will explore how the BCS theory can be used to predict the behavior of superconductors in practical applications.

In summary, this chapter will provide a comprehensive understanding of the second part of the BCS theory, focusing on the behavior of superconductors at higher temperatures. It will provide a solid foundation for further exploration of the fascinating world of superconductivity.




### Section: 4.2 BCS II:

#### 4.2a Quasiparticles in superconductors

In the previous section, we discussed the formation of Cooper pairs and the BCS ground state. Now, we will delve deeper into the concept of quasiparticles in superconductors.

Quasiparticles are entities that behave like particles but are not necessarily particles in the strict sense. They are a fundamental concept in condensed matter physics, particularly in the study of superconductors. In superconductors, quasiparticles are the Cooper pairs, which are formed due to the attractive interaction between electrons and phonons.

The concept of quasiparticles is crucial in understanding the behavior of superconductors. The Cooper pairs, as quasiparticles, are responsible for the zero resistance and perfect diamagnetism observed in superconductors. They also contribute to the energy gap, which is a key characteristic of superconductors.

The behavior of quasiparticles in superconductors can be described by the BCS theory. According to the BCS theory, the quasiparticles (Cooper pairs) are bosons, which obey Bose-Einstein statistics. This is in contrast to the fermionic behavior of the individual electrons. The bosonic behavior of the quasiparticles leads to the formation of the BCS ground state, which is a state of minimum energy.

The behavior of quasiparticles in superconductors can be described by the following equations:

1. The energy of a quasiparticle (Cooper pair) is given by the equation:

$$
E = \hbar \omega_c \left( \sqrt{1 + \frac{\Delta(T)^2}{\hbar^2 \omega_c^2}} - 1 \right)
$$

where $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, $\omega_c$ is the characteristic frequency of the system, and $\Delta(T)$ is the energy gap.

2. The wave vector of a quasiparticle is given by the equation:

$$
k = \sqrt{\frac{2m}{\hbar^2} \left( E - \hbar \omega_c \right)}
$$

where $m$ is the mass of the quasiparticle.

3. The velocity of a quasiparticle is given by the equation:

$$
v = \frac{\hbar k}{m}
$$

These equations describe the behavior of quasiparticles in superconductors. They are crucial in understanding the properties of superconductors and predicting their behavior under different conditions. In the next section, we will discuss the implications of these equations and their role in the behavior of superconductors.

#### 4.2b Quasiparticle scattering

In the previous section, we discussed the behavior of quasiparticles in superconductors. Now, we will delve deeper into the concept of quasiparticle scattering, which is a crucial aspect of the behavior of superconductors.

Quasiparticle scattering refers to the process by which quasiparticles (Cooper pairs) interact with each other or with other entities in the system. This interaction can lead to the exchange of energy and momentum between the quasiparticles, which can affect the overall behavior of the system.

The scattering of quasiparticles can be described by the BCS theory. According to the BCS theory, the scattering of quasiparticles is governed by the attractive interaction between them. This interaction leads to the formation of Cooper pairs, which are the quasiparticles in superconductors.

The scattering of quasiparticles can be described by the following equations:

1. The scattering rate of quasiparticles is given by the equation:

$$
\frac{1}{\tau} = \frac{1}{\tau_0} \tanh \left( \frac{1.74 \hbar \omega_c}{2\Delta(T)} \right)
$$

where $\tau$ is the scattering time, $\tau_0$ is the scattering time at $T=0$, and $\Delta(T)$ is the energy gap.

2. The scattering cross-section of quasiparticles is given by the equation:

$$
\sigma = \frac{\pi}{2} \frac{\Delta(T)^2}{\hbar \omega_c} \tanh \left( \frac{1.74 \hbar \omega_c}{2\Delta(T)} \right)
$$

where $\sigma$ is the scattering cross-section.

These equations describe the scattering of quasiparticles in superconductors. They are crucial in understanding the behavior of superconductors and predicting their response to external perturbations. In the next section, we will discuss the implications of these equations and their role in the behavior of superconductors.

#### 4.2c Quasiparticle interactions

In the previous section, we discussed the scattering of quasiparticles, which is a crucial aspect of the behavior of superconductors. Now, we will delve deeper into the concept of quasiparticle interactions, which is another important aspect of superconductivity.

Quasiparticle interactions refer to the interactions between quasiparticles (Cooper pairs) and other entities in the system. These interactions can be due to various reasons, such as the presence of impurities, defects, or external perturbations. These interactions can affect the behavior of the system, including the formation and breaking of Cooper pairs.

The interactions of quasiparticles can be described by the BCS theory. According to the BCS theory, the interactions of quasiparticles are governed by the attractive interaction between them. This interaction leads to the formation of Cooper pairs, which are the quasiparticles in superconductors.

The interactions of quasiparticles can be described by the following equations:

1. The interaction energy between quasiparticles is given by the equation:

$$
E_{\text{int}} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i \neq j} V_{ij} n_i n_j
$$

where $V_{ij}$ is the interaction potential between quasiparticles $i$ and $j$, and $n_i$ and $n_j$ are the occupation numbers of the quasiparticles.

2. The interaction cross-section between quasiparticles is given by the equation:

$$
\sigma_{\text{int}} = \frac{\pi}{2} \frac{\Delta(T)^2}{\hbar \omega_c} \tanh \left( \frac{1.74 \hbar \omega_c}{2\Delta(T)} \right)
$$

where $\sigma_{\text{int}}$ is the interaction cross-section.

These equations describe the interactions of quasiparticles in superconductors. They are crucial in understanding the behavior of superconductors and predicting their response to external perturbations. In the next section, we will discuss the implications of these equations and their role in the behavior of superconductors.

### Conclusion

### Section: 4.2 BCS II:

#### 4.2b Density of states in BCS theory

The density of states (DOS) is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics that describes the number of states available for a particle to occupy in a given energy range. In the context of superconductivity, the density of states plays a crucial role in determining the behavior of Cooper pairs and the overall properties of the superconductor.

In the BCS theory, the density of states is modified due to the formation of Cooper pairs. The Cooper pairs are bosons, and as such, they occupy the same quantum state. This leads to a reduction in the density of states at the Fermi level, which is the energy level at which the probability of finding an electron is highest.

The density of states in the BCS theory can be described by the following equation:

$$
D(E) = \frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{\sqrt{E^2 - \Delta^2}}
$$

where $D(E)$ is the density of states, $E$ is the energy, and $\Delta$ is the energy gap. This equation describes the density of states above the energy gap, where the Cooper pairs exist. Below the energy gap, the density of states is zero, as there are no available states for the Cooper pairs.

The reduction in the density of states at the Fermi level leads to a decrease in the number of available states for the individual electrons. This, in turn, leads to an increase in the probability of the electrons forming Cooper pairs. This is a key factor in the formation of the BCS ground state and the onset of superconductivity.

The density of states also plays a crucial role in determining the critical temperature $T_c$ at which superconductivity occurs. The critical temperature is determined by the condition that the density of states at the Fermi level must be greater than zero. This condition leads to the following equation for the critical temperature:

$$
T_c = \frac{\hbar \omega_c}{2k_B} \exp \left( \frac{-1}{N(0) \hbar \omega_c} \right)
$$

where $N(0)$ is the density of states at the Fermi level, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, $\omega_c$ is the characteristic frequency of the system, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.

In conclusion, the density of states plays a crucial role in the BCS theory of superconductivity. It is responsible for the formation of Cooper pairs and the onset of superconductivity, and it also determines the critical temperature at which superconductivity occurs.

#### 4.2c BCS-BEC crossover

The BCS-BEC crossover is a critical concept in the study of superconductivity. It describes the transition from a state of Cooper pairs (BCS) to a state of bosonic Cooper pairs (BEC) as the temperature decreases below the critical temperature $T_c$.

In the BCS theory, the Cooper pairs are described as fermions, which obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. As the temperature decreases below $T_c$, the Cooper pairs start to overlap, leading to a decrease in the kinetic energy of the system. This decrease in kinetic energy is compensated by an increase in the potential energy, which is due to the repulsion between the Cooper pairs.

At temperatures close to $T_c$, the Cooper pairs are still well-defined entities, and the system is in the BCS regime. However, as the temperature decreases further, the Cooper pairs start to overlap more and more, leading to a loss of definition. This is when the system enters the BEC regime, where the Cooper pairs are described as bosons, which obey Bose-Einstein statistics.

The transition from the BCS regime to the BEC regime can be described by the following equation:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{\sqrt{E^2 - \Delta^2}} \rightarrow \frac{1}{E - \Delta}
$$

where $E$ is the energy and $\Delta$ is the energy gap. This equation describes the change in the density of states as the system transitions from the BCS regime to the BEC regime.

The BCS-BEC crossover is a crucial concept in the study of superconductivity. It describes the transition from a state of individual Cooper pairs to a state of bosonic Cooper pairs, which is a key factor in the formation of the BCS ground state and the onset of superconductivity.




#### 4.2c BCS-BEC crossover

The BCS-BEC crossover is a critical concept in the study of superconductivity. It describes the transition from a BCS ground state, where Cooper pairs dominate, to a BEC ground state, where Cooper pairs condense into a macroscopic wave function. This transition is governed by the parameter $\gamma = \frac{1}{2} \frac{m}{\hbar^2} \frac{2\pi \hbar}{V} \sqrt{2mE_F}$, where $m$ is the mass of the particle, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant, $V$ is the volume, and $E_F$ is the Fermi energy.

As we have seen in the previous section, the density of states plays a crucial role in determining the behavior of Cooper pairs. In the BCS ground state, the density of states at the Fermi level is greater than zero, leading to the formation of Cooper pairs. However, as we approach the BCS-BEC crossover, the density of states at the Fermi level decreases, leading to a decrease in the number of available states for the Cooper pairs.

At a certain point, the density of states at the Fermi level becomes less than zero, leading to the formation of a BEC ground state. In this state, the Cooper pairs condense into a macroscopic wave function, leading to a phase transition from a BCS ground state to a BEC ground state. This transition is characterized by a change in the behavior of the Cooper pairs from fermions to bosons.

The BCS-BEC crossover is a crucial concept in understanding the behavior of superconductors. It provides a framework for understanding the transition from a BCS ground state, where Cooper pairs dominate, to a BEC ground state, where Cooper pairs condense into a macroscopic wave function. This transition is governed by the parameter $\gamma$, which describes the strength of the interactions between the Cooper pairs. By studying the BCS-BEC crossover, we can gain a deeper understanding of the microscopic interactions and the Cooper problem in superconductivity.





#### 4.3a Quantum bits and qubits

Quantum bits and qubits are fundamental building blocks of quantum computing. They are the quantum analogues of classical bits and are used to store and manipulate information in a quantum system. In this section, we will explore the properties and operations of quantum bits and qubits, and how they differ from their classical counterparts.

##### Quantum bits

A quantum bit, or qubit, is a unit of information that can exist in a superposition of two states, denoted as $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$. This means that a qubit can be in both states simultaneously, unlike classical bits which can only exist in one state at a time. This property allows for the processing of information in parallel, making quantum computing much faster than classical computing.

The general superposition of a qubit can be written as $| \psi \rangle = \alpha | 0 \rangle + \beta | 1 \rangle$, where $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$ and $\alpha,\beta \in \Complex$. This means that the state of the qubit is a combination of the states $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$, with the probabilities of measuring the state as $| 0 \rangle$ or $| 1 \rangle$ being $|\alpha|^2$ and $|\beta|^2$, respectively.

##### Quantum gates

Quantum gates are the basic operations that can be performed on qubits. They are analogous to classical logic gates, but with the added ability to manipulate the superposition of states. The most commonly used quantum gates are the Hadamard gate, the Pauli gates, and the CNOT gate.

The Hadamard gate is a unitary operator that creates a superposition of states, mapping $| 0 \rangle$ to $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (| 0 \rangle + | 1 \rangle)$ and $| 1 \rangle$ to $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (| 0 \rangle - | 1 \rangle)$. This gate is essential for creating entangled states, which are crucial for quantum computing.

The Pauli gates are a set of three gates that act on the states $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$. The Pauli-X gate flips the state of a qubit, mapping $| 0 \rangle$ to $| 1 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$ to $| 0 \rangle$. The Pauli-Y gate rotates the state of a qubit by 90 degrees, and the Pauli-Z gate acts as a basis change, mapping $| 0 \rangle$ to $| + \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$ to $| - \rangle$.

The CNOT gate is a controlled-NOT gate, which is used to perform a NOT operation on the second qubit only if the first qubit is in the state $| 1 \rangle$. This gate is essential for implementing quantum algorithms, such as Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers.

##### Quantum circuits

Quantum circuits are a series of quantum gates that are used to perform a specific operation on a set of qubits. These circuits can be used to implement quantum algorithms, such as quantum Fourier transforms and quantum error correction codes.

The Pauli-Y gate rotates the state of a qubit by 90 degrees, mapping $| 0 \rangle$ to $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (| 0 \rangle + i | 1 \rangle)$ and $| 1 \rangle$ to $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (| 0 \rangle - i | 1 \rangle)$. The Pauli-Z gate flips the phase of a qubit, mapping $| 0 \rangle$ to $| 0 \rangle$ and $| 1 \rangle$ to $-| 1 \rangle$.

The CNOT gate is a two-qubit gate that flips the second qubit if and only if the first qubit is in the state $| 1 \rangle$. This gate is essential for implementing classical logic gates in quantum computing.

## Chapter: Chapter 5: Macroscopic Phenomena and Meissner Effect

### Introduction

In the realm of physics, the study of superconductivity is a fascinating and complex field. It is a state of matter where certain materials exhibit zero electrical resistance and perfect diamagnetism when cooled below a critical temperature. This chapter, "Macroscopic Phenomena and Meissner Effect," delves into the macroscopic aspects of superconductivity, focusing on the Meissner effect, a fundamental phenomenon that is a direct consequence of the superconducting state.

The Meissner effect, named after physicist Walther Meissner and Robert Ochsenfeld, is a quantum mechanical phenomenon that occurs in superconductors. It is characterized by the complete expulsion of magnetic fields from the interior of a superconductor when it transitions into the superconducting state. This effect is a direct consequence of the London equations, which describe the behavior of superconductors in the presence of an electromagnetic field.

In this chapter, we will explore the macroscopic implications of the Meissner effect, including its role in the levitation of superconducting trains and its applications in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We will also delve into the mathematical foundations of the Meissner effect, using the powerful language of vector calculus and differential equations.

We will also discuss the critical temperature, a key parameter in superconductivity, and how it relates to the onset of superconductivity. This will involve a discussion on the BCS theory, which provides a microscopic explanation for superconductivity.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the macroscopic phenomena associated with superconductivity, with a particular focus on the Meissner effect.

#### 4.4a Superconducting qubits

Superconducting qubits are one of the most promising platforms for quantum computing due to their scalability, controllability, and robustness. They are based on the principles of superconductivity, which is the phenomenon where certain materials exhibit zero electrical resistance and perfect diamagnetism when cooled below a critical temperature. This critical temperature is typically very low, often below 10 K, which poses a significant challenge for practical applications.

##### Superconducting qubit design

The design of a superconducting qubit involves shaping a potential well and choosing a particle mass such that the energy separation between two specific energy levels is unique. These two levels are used as the logical states of the qubit. The primary challenge in this design is mitigating quantum noise and leakage.

Quantum noise refers to disruptions of the system caused by its interaction with the environment. This can be reduced by using parity measurements, which are a type of measurement that can distinguish between even and odd numbers of particles in a superconducting island.

Leakage, on the other hand, refers to information being lost to the surrounding environment. This can be mitigated by carefully designing the potential well and choosing the particle mass.

##### Superconducting quantum computing challenges

Despite the promising potential of superconducting qubits, there are several challenges that need to be addressed for practical applications. These include:

- Scalability: As superconducting quantum computing approaches larger scale devices, researchers face difficulties in qubit coherence, scalable calibration software, efficient determination of fidelity of quantum states across an entire chip, and qubit and gate fidelity.
- Reliability: Superconducting quantum computing devices must be reliably reproducable at increasingly large scales such that they are compatible with these improvements.
- Microwave engineering: Many current challenges faced by superconducting quantum computing lie in the field of microwave engineering. As superconducting quantum computing approaches larger scale devices, researchers face difficulties in qubit coherence, scalable calibration software, efficient determination of fidelity of quantum states across an entire chip, and qubit and gate fidelity.

##### The journey of superconducting quantum computing

The journey of superconducting quantum computing began in the latter half of the 1990s when quantum tunneling across Josephson junctions became apparent. This led to the realization that quantum computing could be achieved through these superconducting qubits.

In 1999, a paper was published by Yasunobu Nakamura, which introduced the initial design of a superconducting qubit known as the "charge qubit". This design served as the basis for later designs and amendments. However, these initial qubits had their limitations in terms of scalability and reliability.

Despite these challenges, superconducting quantum computing continues to be a promising platform for quantum computing due to its scalability, controllability, and robustness. Ongoing research is focused on addressing these challenges and improving the performance of superconducting qubits.

Quantum gates are the quantum analogues of classical logic gates. They operate on quantum states, taking a quantum state as an input and producing a quantum state as an output. The key difference between classical and quantum gates is that quantum gates are unitary, meaning that they preserve the total probability of the input state.

There are several types of quantum gates, including:

- Single-qubit gates: These gates operate on a single qubit and include the Pauli gates (X, Y, Z), the Hadamard gate (H), and the phase gate (P).
- Multi-qubit gates: These gates operate on multiple qubits and include the CNOT gate (Controlled-NOT), the Toffoli gate (Controlled-Controlled-NOT), and the SWAP gate (Swap).

#### 4.4b Quantum error correction

Quantum error correction (QEC) is a crucial aspect of quantum computing, particularly in the context of superconducting qubits. As we have seen in the previous section, superconducting qubits are susceptible to various types of errors, including bit flips and sign flips. These errors can significantly degrade the performance of a quantum computer and even lead to incorrect results. Therefore, it is essential to have a mechanism in place to detect and correct these errors.

##### Quantum error correction codes

Quantum error correction codes are mathematical constructs that allow us to detect and correct errors in quantum systems. These codes are designed to protect quantum information from errors caused by noise and other disturbances. They work by encoding the quantum information in a larger system, known as the code space, which is designed to be robust against certain types of errors.

One of the most well-known quantum error correction codes is the Shor code, published in 1995. This code can correct for both bit flips and sign flips on any one qubit. The Shor code is based on the concept of stabilizer codes, which are a class of quantum error correction codes that are particularly well-suited to superconducting qubits.

##### Quantum error correction in superconducting qubits

In the context of superconducting qubits, quantum error correction is typically implemented using the Shor code. The 1st, 4th, and 7th qubits are used for the sign flip code, while the three groups of qubits (1,2,3), (4,5,6), and (7,8,9) are designed for the bit flip code.

The operation of the Shor code can be understood in terms of the Hadamard basis. A qubit state $|\psi\rangle=\alpha_0|0\rangle+\alpha_1|1\rangle$ is transformed into the product of 9 qubits $|\psi'\rangle=\alpha_0|0_S\rangle+\alpha_1|1_S\rangle$, where $|0_S\rangle$ and $|1_S\rangle$ are the states of the Shor code.

The Shor code can correct for arbitrary single-qubit errors. Let $E$ be a quantum channel that can arbitrarily corrupt a single qubit. The Shor code can be used to recover the original state $|\psi\rangle$ by transforming it into the Hadamard basis before and after transmission through $E$.

In conclusion, quantum error correction is a crucial aspect of quantum computing, particularly in the context of superconducting qubits. The Shor code, with its ability to correct for both bit flips and sign flips, is a powerful tool in the fight against quantum errors.

The algorithm is based on the quantum Fourier transform, which allows us to efficiently measure the period of a function.

The algorithm works by encoding the number to be factored as a quantum state. The quantum Fourier transform is then used to find the period of this number, which corresponds to one of its factors. This process is repeated for each of the factors, and the final result is obtained by measuring the state of the system.

##### Grover's algorithm

Grover's algorithm is a quantum algorithm for searching unsorted databases. It is named after its creator, Lov Grover, and is another important result in the field of quantum computing. The algorithm is based on the concept of quantum amplification, which allows us to increase the probability of finding a desired state.

The algorithm works by encoding the database as a quantum state. The desired state is then amplified using the quantum amplification technique. This process is repeated until the desired state is found with high probability.

## Chapter: Chapter 5: Josephson junctions and SQUIDs

### Introduction

In this chapter, we delve into the fascinating world of Josephson junctions and Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs). These are two fundamental components in the field of applied superconductivity, with a wide range of applications in quantum computing, quantum information processing, and quantum sensing.

Josephson junctions, named after physicist Brian D. Josephson, are one of the key building blocks of superconducting quantum computing. They are essentially superconducting devices that exhibit a phenomenon known as the Josephson effect, which allows for the flow of supercurrent between two superconductors. This effect is crucial for the operation of superconducting quantum computers, as it allows for the manipulation of quantum states.

On the other hand, SQUIDs (Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices) are another essential component in the field of applied superconductivity. They are superconducting devices that exploit the quantum mechanical phenomenon of superposition to perform precise measurements of magnetic fields. SQUIDs have a wide range of applications, from medical imaging to geophysical exploration.

In this chapter, we will explore the principles of operation of Josephson junctions and SQUIDs, their fabrication techniques, and their applications in various fields. We will also discuss the challenges and future prospects of these devices, as we continue to push the boundaries of what is possible with applied superconductivity.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive guide to these two important components of applied superconductivity, equipping readers with the knowledge and understanding necessary to explore this exciting field further. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional in the field, we hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource in your journey.




#### 4.4c Quantum algorithms

Quantum algorithms are a set of instructions that are designed to be executed by a quantum computer. These algorithms leverage the principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to solve problems that are intractable for classical computers. In this section, we will discuss some of the most important quantum algorithms, including the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations and the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations.

##### Quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations

The quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations is a powerful tool for solving systems of linear equations. This algorithm is particularly useful when the system of equations is large and sparse, meaning that most of the coefficients are zero. The algorithm assumes that the user is not interested in the values of the solution vector, but rather the result of applying some operator onto the solution vector.

The problem that the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations solves is: given a $N \times N$ Hermitian matrix $A$ and a unit vector $\overrightarrow{b}$, find the solution vector $\overrightarrow{x}$ satisfying $A\overrightarrow{x}=\overrightarrow{b}$. The algorithm assumes that the user is not interested in the values of $\overrightarrow{x}$ itself, but rather the result of applying some operator $M$ onto $x$, $\langle x|M|x\rangle$.

The algorithm begins by representing the vector $\overrightarrow{b}$ as a quantum state of the form:

$$
|b\rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{N} b_i|i\rangle
$$

Next, Hamiltonian simulation techniques are used to apply the unitary operator $e^{iAt}$ to $|b\rangle$ for a superposition of different times $t$. The ability to decompose $|b\rangle$ into the eigenbasis of $A$ and to find the corresponding eigenvalues $\lambda_j$ is facilitated by the use of quantum phase estimation.

The state of

$$
|\psi\rangle = \sum_{j=1}^{N} \lambda_j|u_j\rangle|\lambda_j\rangle
$$

is then measured in the computational basis, yielding the eigenvalues $\lambda_j$ and eigenvectors $u_j$ of $A$. The solution vector $\overrightarrow{x}$ is then given by $\overrightarrow{x} = \sum_{j=1}^{N} \lambda_j^{-1}u_j$.

$$

##### Quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations

The quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations is a powerful tool for solving systems of linear equations. This algorithm is particularly useful when the system of equations is large and sparse, meaning that most of the coefficients are zero. The algorithm assumes that the user is not interested in the values of the solution vector, but rather the result of applying some operator onto the solution vector.

The problem that the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations solves is: given a $N \times N$ Hermitian matrix $A$ and a unit vector $\overrightarrow{b}$, find the solution vector $\overrightarrow{x}$ satisfying $A\overrightarrow{x}=\overrightarrow{b}$. The algorithm assumes that the user is not interested in the values of $\overrightarrow{x}$ itself, but rather the result of applying some operator $M$ onto $x$, $\langle x|M|x\rangle$.

The algorithm begins by representing the vector $\overrightarrow{b}$ as a quantum state of the form:

$$
|b\rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{N} b_i|i\rangle
$$

Next, Hamiltonian simulation techniques are used to apply the unitary operator $e^{iAt}$ to $|b\rangle$ for a superposition of different times $t$. The ability to decompose $|b\rangle$ into the eigenbasis of $A$ and to find the corresponding eigenvalues $\lambda_j$ is facilitated by the use of quantum phase estimation.

#### 4.5a Josephson junction as a qubit

The Josephson junction is a fundamental component in superconducting quantum computing. It is a type of quantum tunneling device that allows for the manipulation of quantum states. The Josephson junction is named after physicist Brian D. Josephson, who predicted the existence of this phenomenon in 1962.

The Josephson junction is a superconducting device that consists of two superconducting electrodes separated by a thin insulating layer. When a voltage is applied across the junction, electrons can tunnel through the insulating layer, leading to a supercurrent flow. This supercurrent flow is a direct consequence of the Josephson effect, which is the phenomenon of a supercurrent flowing between two superconductors separated by a thin insulating barrier.

The Josephson junction can be used as a qubit, the basic unit of quantum computing. A qubit, short for quantum bit, is the quantum analogue of a classical bit. Just like a classical bit can be in the state 0 or 1, a qubit can be in a superposition of states. This property allows for the implementation of quantum algorithms that can solve problems that are intractable for classical computers.

The Josephson junction qubit is one of the most studied and understood qubit systems. It is relatively easy to fabricate and manipulate, making it a popular choice for quantum computing applications. However, it also has its limitations. For instance, the energy separation between two specific energy levels of the qubit must be unique, differing from all other interlevel energy separation in the system. This is because these two levels are used as logical states of the qubit.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the quantum tunneling phenomenon and its role in superconducting quantum computing. We will also discuss the challenges and potential solutions in the design and implementation of superconducting qubits.

#### 4.5b Superconducting quantum interference device

The Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) is another fundamental component in superconducting quantum computing. It is a type of quantum tunneling device that allows for the manipulation of quantum states. The SQUID is named after the quantum interference phenomenon that it exploits.

The SQUID is a superconducting device that consists of two Josephson junctions connected in parallel. When a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the plane of the SQUID, it can induce a supercurrent flow through the device. This supercurrent flow is a direct consequence of the Aharonov-Bohm effect, which is the phenomenon of a supercurrent flowing around a magnetic field line.

The SQUID can be used as a qubit, just like the Josephson junction. However, the SQUID has the advantage of being able to store quantum information in the form of a magnetic field. This makes it particularly useful for quantum computing applications that require long-term storage of quantum information.

The SQUID also has its limitations. For instance, the energy separation between two specific energy levels of the qubit must be unique, differing from all other interlevel energy separation in the system. This is because these two levels are used as logical states of the qubit.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the quantum interference phenomenon and its role in superconducting quantum computing. We will also discuss the challenges and potential solutions in the design and implementation of superconducting qubits.

#### 4.5c Superconducting quantum computing

Superconducting quantum computing is a promising field that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations. Superconducting quantum computers use superconducting circuits to manipulate quantum states, which allows for the implementation of quantum algorithms that can solve problems that are intractable for classical computers.

One of the primary challenges of superconducting quantum computing is the extremely low temperatures at which superconductors like Bose-Einstein Condensates exist. This is because superconductivity is a phenomenon that occurs at very low temperatures, typically below 10 K. This poses significant challenges for the design and implementation of superconducting quantum computers, as it requires the use of expensive and complex refrigeration systems.

Another challenge in superconducting quantum computing is shaping the potential well and choosing particle mass such that energy separation between two specific energy levels is unique, differing from all other interlevel energy separation in the system. This is because these two levels are used as logical states of the qubit.

Superconducting quantum computing must also mitigate quantum noise (disruptions of the system caused by its interaction with an environment) as well as leakage (information being lost to the surrounding environment). One way to reduce leakage is with parity measurements. Many current challenges faced by superconducting quantum computing lie in the field of microwave engineering. As superconducting quantum computing approaches larger scale devices, researchers face difficulties in qubit coherence, scalable calibration software, efficient determination of fidelity of quantum states across an entire chip, and qubit and gate fidelity.

The Journey of Superconducting Quantum Computing:

The journey of superconducting quantum computing began in the latter half of the 1990s when quantum tunneling across Josephson junctions became apparent. This led to the realization that quantum computing could be achieved through these superconducting qubits.

At the end of the century in 1999, a paper was published by Yasunobu Nakamura, which exhibited the initial design of a superconducting qubit. This design, known as the "charge qubit", is the primary basis point on which later designs amended upon. These initial qubits had their limitations in terms of scalability and coherence, but they laid the foundation for the development of more advanced superconducting qubits.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the principles of superconducting quantum computing, discussing the design and implementation of superconducting qubits, as well as the challenges and potential solutions in this field.

The energy separation between two specific energy levels of the qubit must be unique, differing from all other interlevel energy separation in the system. This is because these two levels are used as logical states of the qubit.

Another type of superconducting quantum computing device is the superconducting quantum dot. The quantum dot is a small region of superconducting material that can confine electrons and holes. The energy levels of these confined particles can be manipulated using external electric and magnetic fields, allowing for the implementation of quantum algorithms.

Superconducting quantum computing devices also include superconducting quantum wells and superconducting quantum wires. These devices are designed to confine electrons and holes in two and one dimensions, respectively. The confinement of these particles leads to the formation of energy levels, which can be manipulated using external fields.

This chapter, "Josephson junctions and SQUIDs," aims to delve into the intricate details of these two fundamental concepts, providing a comprehensive understanding of their principles, applications, and the role they play in the broader context of quantum physics.

The Josephson junction, named after physicist Brian D. Josephson, is a type of superconducting device that exhibits a phenomenon known as the Josephson effect. This effect, which allows for the transfer of supercurrent between two superconductors separated by a thin insulator, is a cornerstone of superconductivity and quantum computing.

#### 4.5b SQUIDs as quantum detectors

Superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) are another type of quantum tunneling device that have been extensively studied for their potential use as quantum detectors. SQUIDs are essentially Josephson junctions with a superconducting loop in between. The superconducting loop allows for the creation of a magnetic flux quantum, which is a stable and quantized unit of magnetic flux.

The SQUID can be used as a quantum detector by measuring the change in the magnetic flux quantum when a quantum system interacts with it. This change can then be used to infer information about the quantum system. For instance, the SQUID can be used to detect the presence of a spin-1/2 particle, such as an electron, by measuring the change in the magnetic flux quantum when the spin of the particle interacts with the SQUID.

The SQUID is particularly well-suited for this task because of its high sensitivity to changes in magnetic flux. This sensitivity can be further enhanced by operating the SQUID at very low temperatures, where quantum effects become more pronounced.

In addition to their use as quantum detectors, SQUIDs have also been proposed as a means of quantum computing. The superconducting loop in the SQUID can be used to store and manipulate quantum information, making it a potential candidate for a qubit. However, the use of SQUIDs for quantum computing is still in its early stages and many challenges remain to be overcome.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the quantum tunneling phenomenon and its role in superconducting quantum computing. We will also discuss the challenges and potential solutions in the design and implementation of superconducting qubits.

#### 4.5c Quantum tunneling in superconductors

Quantum tunneling is a fundamental phenomenon in superconductors that allows for the transmission of quantum information without any loss of information. This is achieved through the quantum mechanical effect of tunneling, which allows particles to pass through potential barriers that would be impenetrable according to classical physics.

In superconductors, quantum tunneling is facilitated by the Meissner effect, which is the expulsion of magnetic fields from the interior of a superconductor. This effect allows for the creation of a superconducting loop, which can be used to create a magnetic flux quantum. The magnetic flux quantum is a stable and quantized unit of magnetic flux, and it is this property that allows for the detection of quantum systems.

The quantum tunneling phenomenon in superconductors has been extensively studied for its potential use in quantum computing. The superconducting loop can be used to store and manipulate quantum information, making it a potential candidate for a qubit. However, the use of superconductors for quantum computing is still in its early stages and many challenges remain to be overcome.

One of the main challenges in using superconductors for quantum computing is the need for extremely low temperatures. Superconductivity is typically observed at temperatures below the critical temperature, which can be as low as a few kelvins. This requirement for extremely low temperatures makes it difficult to scale up quantum computing systems based on superconductors.

Another challenge is the need for extremely high purity in the materials used for superconductors. Any impurities or defects can disrupt the superconducting state and prevent quantum tunneling from occurring. This requires a high degree of control over the fabrication process, which can be difficult to achieve.

Despite these challenges, superconductors continue to be a promising platform for quantum computing due to their unique properties. The ability to create and manipulate magnetic flux quanta, combined with the high sensitivity of superconducting devices to changes in magnetic flux, make them a powerful tool for quantum detection and information processing.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the quantum tunneling phenomenon and its role in superconducting quantum computing. We will also discuss the challenges and potential solutions in the design and implementation of superconducting qubits.

#### 4.6a Superconducting qubits

Superconducting qubits are a type of quantum bit, or qubit, that are used in quantum computing. They are based on the principles of superconductivity and quantum tunneling, and they have been extensively studied for their potential use in quantum computing.

Superconducting qubits are typically realized using Josephson junctions, which are devices that exhibit superconductivity. These junctions are characterized by a critical current, $I_c$, and a junction capacitance, $C_J$. The energy of a Josephson junction is given by the equation:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2}LI_c^2 + \frac{1}{2}C_J(\Delta\Phi)^2
$$

where $L$ is the inductance of the junction, and $\Delta\Phi$ is the change in the magnetic flux through the junction. This equation shows that the energy of the junction is proportional to the square of the change in magnetic flux.

The superconducting loop, which is used to create a magnetic flux quantum, is typically made of a superconducting material such as niobium. The loop is interrupted by a Josephson junction, which allows for the creation of a magnetic flux quantum. The magnetic flux quantum is a stable and quantized unit of magnetic flux, and it is this property that allows for the detection of quantum systems.

Superconducting qubits have been extensively studied for their potential use in quantum computing. They have been used to demonstrate a variety of quantum algorithms, including Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers, and Grover's algorithm for searching unsorted databases. However, the use of superconducting qubits for quantum computing is still in its early stages and many challenges remain to be overcome.

One of the main challenges in using superconducting qubits for quantum computing is the need for extremely low temperatures. Superconductivity is typically observed at temperatures below the critical temperature, which can be as low as a few kelvins. This requirement for extremely low temperatures makes it difficult to scale up quantum computing systems based on superconducting qubits.

#### 4.6b Superconducting quantum computing

Superconducting quantum computing is a promising approach to building a quantum computer. It leverages the principles of superconductivity and quantum tunneling to create qubits that can be manipulated to perform quantum computations.

The superconducting quantum computer is composed of a series of superconducting qubits, each of which is a Josephson junction. These qubits are arranged in a lattice, and each qubit is coupled to its neighbors through a superconducting loop. This coupling allows for the transfer of quantum information between qubits, enabling the implementation of quantum algorithms.

The superconducting quantum computer operates at extremely low temperatures, typically below 10 millikelvins. This is necessary to maintain the superconducting state of the qubits. The low temperatures also help to minimize quantum noise, which can disrupt the quantum state of the qubits and lead to errors in computations.

One of the key challenges in superconducting quantum computing is the scalability of the system. As the number of qubits in the system increases, the complexity of the system also increases, making it difficult to control and manipulate the qubits. This is known as the "scaling problem".

Despite these challenges, significant progress has been made in superconducting quantum computing. Researchers have demonstrated the operation of a superconducting quantum computer with 50 qubits, and have shown that it is possible to perform quantum computations on this system.

Superconducting quantum computing also offers several advantages over other approaches to quantum computing. For example, superconducting qubits can be fabricated using standard semiconductor manufacturing techniques, which allows for the mass production of these devices. This could potentially lead to a significant reduction in the cost of quantum computing.

In addition, superconducting qubits can be operated at relatively high frequencies, allowing for faster quantum computations. This could potentially lead to a significant increase in the speed of quantum algorithms, making them more practical for real-world applications.

In conclusion, superconducting quantum computing is a promising approach to building a quantum computer. While there are still many challenges to overcome, the progress made so far suggests that it is possible to build a practical quantum computer using this approach.

#### 4.5c Single-photon detectors in superconductors

Single-photon detectors (SPDs) are devices that are designed to detect single photons with high efficiency and speed. They are essential tools in many areas of quantum physics, including quantum cryptography, quantum communication, and quantum computing. In this section, we will discuss the principle of operation of SPDs and their applications in quantum physics.

##### Principle of operation

The operation of single-photon detectors in superconductors is based on the quantum mechanical effect of quantum tunneling. This effect allows for the transmission of quantum information without any loss of information. The SPD consists of a thin and narrow superconducting nanowire, typically a few nanometers thick and a few hundred nanometers wide. The length of the nanowire is typically hundreds of micrometers, and it is patterned in a compact meander geometry to create a square or circular pixel with high detection efficiency.

The nanowire is cooled well below its superconducting critical temperature and biased with a DC current that is close to but less than the superconducting critical current of the nanowire. A photon incident on the nanowire breaks Cooper pairs and reduces the local critical current below that of the bias current. This results in the formation of a localized non-superconducting region, or hotspot, with finite electrical resistance. This resistance is typically larger than the 50 Ohm input impedance of the readout amplifier, and hence most of the bias current is shunted to the amplifier. This produces a measurable voltage pulse that is approximately equal to the bias current multiplied by 50 Ohms. With most of the bias current flowing through the amplifier, the non-superconducting region cools and returns to the superconducting state. The time for the current to return to the nanowire is typically set by the inductive time constant of the nanowire, equal to the kinetic inductance of the nanowire divided by the impedance of the readout circuit. Proper self-resetting of the device requires that this inductive time constant be slower than the intrinsic cooling time of the nanowire hotspot.

##### Applications in quantum physics

Single-photon detectors in superconductors have a wide range of applications in quantum physics. They are used in quantum cryptography to detect single photons that are used for secure communication. They are also used in quantum communication to transmit quantum information without any loss of information. In quantum computing, SPDs are used to detect single qubits, which are the basic units of quantum computers.

In addition to these applications, SPDs are also used in quantum physics research to study quantum phenomena such as quantum entanglement and quantum teleportation. They are also used in quantum sensors to detect and measure quantum states.

In conclusion, single-photon detectors in superconductors are essential tools in quantum physics. Their ability to detect single photons with high efficiency and speed makes them indispensable in many areas of quantum physics. As research in quantum physics continues to advance, the development of more advanced and efficient SPDs will be crucial for further progress in this field.

# Title: Applied Superconductivity: A Comprehensive Guide":

## Chapter: - Chapter 6: Superconducting Materials:




## Chapter 6: Superconducting Materials:




### Section: 6.1 High-Temperature Superconductors:

High-temperature superconductors (HTS) are a class of superconducting materials that exhibit superconductivity at temperatures above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen (77 K). This is significantly higher than the critical temperature of conventional superconductors, which are typically below 10 K. The discovery of HTS materials in the late 1980s revolutionized the field of superconductivity, as it opened up the possibility of using cheaper and more readily available refrigerants such as liquid nitrogen for superconducting applications.

#### 6.1a BCS Theory

The discovery of HTS materials also led to a reevaluation of the BCS theory, which had been developed to explain superconductivity in conventional superconductors. The BCS theory predicts that superconductivity should occur in materials with a high density of states at the Fermi level, which is typically found in metals with a high degree of electron-phonon interaction. However, many HTS materials are insulators with a low density of states at the Fermi level, and their superconductivity cannot be explained by the BCS theory.

To account for this, several extensions of the BCS theory have been proposed, including the BCS-BEC crossover theory and the BCS-BEC theory. These theories propose that the superconductivity in HTS materials is a result of a crossover from a BCS-like state at low temperatures to a BEC-like state at high temperatures. This crossover is driven by the increasing importance of electron-phonon interactions at higher temperatures.

The BCS-BEC crossover theory also accounts for the observed anisotropy in the superconducting properties of HTS materials. This anisotropy is a result of the different orientations of the crystal lattice in different directions, which leads to variations in the electron-phonon interaction. This theory also explains the observed increase in the critical temperature with increasing doping level in HTS materials.

#### 6.1b YBCO and BSCCO

Two of the most well-known HTS materials are yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO) and bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (BSCCO). These materials have critical temperatures above 90 K and have been extensively studied for their potential applications in superconducting devices.

YBCO is a single-layer material with a simple crystal structure, making it easier to synthesize and process compared to other HTS materials. It also has a high critical current density, making it suitable for high-field applications. However, YBCO is also highly sensitive to magnetic fields, which can lead to a decrease in its critical temperature.

BSCCO, on the other hand, is a multi-layer material with a more complex crystal structure. This makes it more difficult to synthesize and process, but it also allows for a higher degree of tunability in its properties. BSCCO has a lower critical current density compared to YBCO, but it is less sensitive to magnetic fields.

Both YBCO and BSCCO have been used in a variety of superconducting applications, including high-field magnets, power transmission, and quantum computing. However, the high cost of producing these materials and the need for extremely low temperatures for their superconductivity still limit their widespread use.

In conclusion, the discovery of HTS materials has led to a reevaluation of the BCS theory and the development of new theories to explain their superconductivity. YBCO and BSCCO are two of the most well-known HTS materials, each with its own unique properties and potential applications. Further research and development in this field will continue to advance our understanding of superconductivity and its potential for practical applications.

HTS materials also have potential applications in power transmission. The ability of these materials to carry large amounts of current without any resistance makes them ideal for transmitting power over long distances with minimal losses.

However, there are several challenges that need to be addressed before HTS materials can be widely used in power transmission. One of the main challenges is the high cost of producing these materials, as mentioned earlier. This makes it difficult to justify the investment in infrastructure for power transmission.

Another challenge is the need for specialized equipment to handle HTS materials. These materials are sensitive to external factors such as temperature and humidity, which can affect their superconducting properties. This requires the use of specialized equipment and facilities, adding to the overall cost of using HTS materials in power transmission.

#### 6.1c.3 Quantum Computing

HTS materials have also been studied for their potential applications in quantum computing. The ability of these materials to carry large amounts of current without any resistance makes them ideal for building quantum computers, which require precise control of quantum states.

However, there are several challenges that need to be addressed before HTS materials can be widely used in quantum computing. One of the main challenges is the high cost of producing these materials, as mentioned earlier. This makes it difficult to justify the investment in building quantum computers.

Another challenge is the need for specialized equipment to handle HTS materials. These materials are sensitive to external factors such as temperature and humidity, which can affect their superconducting properties. This requires the use of specialized equipment and facilities, adding to the overall cost of using HTS materials in quantum computing.

In conclusion, while HTS materials have shown great potential for various applications, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed before they can be widely used. Further research and development are needed to overcome these challenges and fully utilize the potential of HTS materials.





### Subsection: 6.2a Introduction to low-temperature superconductors

Low-temperature superconductors (LTS) are a class of superconducting materials that exhibit superconductivity at temperatures below 30 K. These materials have been extensively studied for their potential applications in various fields, including quantum computing and high-speed computing.

#### 6.2a.1 Superconductivity in Low-Temperature Superconductors

Superconductivity in LTS materials is typically achieved by doping the material with impurities that introduce extra electrons or holes. This process creates a sea of free electrons that can move through the material without resistance when it is cooled below the critical temperature. This phenomenon is known as BCS (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) superconductivity.

The critical temperature, $T_c$, at which a material becomes superconducting, is a key parameter for LTS materials. It is typically lower than that of high-temperature superconductors, but it is still high enough to allow for practical applications. The critical temperature can be affected by various factors, including the type of dopant used, the concentration of dopants, and the crystal structure of the material.

#### 6.2a.2 Types of Low-Temperature Superconductors

There are several types of LTS materials, each with its own unique properties. Some of the most commonly studied types include:

- **Bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide (BSCCO)**: This material has a high critical temperature and is known for its high-speed superconductivity. It is also relatively easy to synthesize, making it a popular choice for research and development.

- **Yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO)**: This material has a high critical temperature and is known for its high critical current density. It is also relatively easy to synthesize, making it a popular choice for research and development.

- **Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)**: This material has been found to exhibit superconductivity at temperatures below 9.4 K when it is in the form of a monolayer. It is also known for its high mechanical strength and chemical stability, making it a promising material for practical applications.

#### 6.2a.3 Applications of Low-Temperature Superconductors

LTS materials have a wide range of potential applications, including:

- **Quantum computing**: The ability of LTS materials to carry large amounts of current without any resistance makes them ideal for building quantum computers. These computers could revolutionize computing by solving complex problems that are currently infeasible for classical computers.

- **High-speed computing**: The high-speed superconductivity of some LTS materials makes them ideal for building high-speed computers. These computers could greatly improve the efficiency of various industries, including finance, data processing, and artificial intelligence.

- **Energy storage**: The ability of LTS materials to carry large amounts of current without any resistance makes them ideal for storing energy in the form of magnetic fields. This has potential applications in power grids, where energy can be stored during off-peak hours and released during peak demand periods.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the properties and applications of these and other LTS materials.




### Subsection: 6.2b Niobium and lead

Niobium and lead are two of the most commonly used elements in the field of superconductivity. Both elements have unique properties that make them ideal for various applications.

#### 6.2b.1 Superconductivity in Niobium

Niobium is a chemical element with the symbol Nb and atomic number 41. It is a soft, grey, ductile transition metal that is often found in the pyrochlore mineral, the main commercial source for niobium, and columbite. The name comes from Greek mythology: "Niobe", daughter of "Tantalus".

Niobium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of the element tantalum, and the two are therefore difficult to distinguish. The English chemistCharles Hatchett reported a new element similar to tantalum in 1801, and named it columbium. In 1809, the English chemist William Hyde Wollaston wrongly concluded that tantalum and columbium were identical. The German chemist Heinrich Rose determined in 1846 that tantalum ores contain a second element, which he named niobium. In 1864 and 1865, a series of scientific findings clarified that niobium and columbium were the same element (as distinguished from tantalum), and for a century both names were used interchangeably. The name of the element was officially adopted as niobium in 1949.

Niobium is a key component in many superconducting materials. It is often used in conjunction with other elements such as titanium and tin to create superconducting alloys. These alloys are widely used in the superconducting magnets of MRI scanners. The superconducting properties of niobium are due to its high critical temperature, $T_c$, which is typically around 9 K.

### Subsection: 7.2a Basics of superconducting RF cavities

Superconducting RF (SRF) cavities are a type of superconducting device that is used in a variety of applications, including particle accelerators and MRI machines. These cavities are made of superconducting materials, which allow them to operate at extremely high electric fields and frequencies.

#### The Physics of SRF Cavities

The physics of SRF cavities is complex and involves several key parameters. These include the quality factor "Q", the energy stored in the cavity "U", and the power dissipated "P". These parameters are defined by the following equations:

$$
Q = \frac{U}{P}
$$

$$
U = \int \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{D} \, dV
$$

$$
P = \int \mathbf{J} \cdot \mathbf{E} \, dA
$$

where $\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field, $\mathbf{D}$ is the electric displacement, and $\mathbf{J}$ is the current density.

The quality factor "Q" is a measure of the cavity's ability to store energy. It is defined as the ratio of the energy stored in the cavity to the power dissipated. A higher quality factor indicates a more efficient cavity.

The energy stored in the cavity "U" is given by the integral of the electric field over the volume of the cavity. This energy is stored in the electric and magnetic fields of the cavity.

The power dissipated "P" is given by the integral of the current density over the surface of the cavity. This power is dissipated due to resistive losses in the cavity walls.

#### The Geometry Factor

Another important parameter of SRF cavities is the Geometry Factor "G". This factor is a measure of the cavity's effectiveness in providing accelerating electric field due to the influence of its shape alone, which excludes specific material wall loss. The Geometry Factor is given by the equation:

$$
G = \frac{1}{R_s} \left( \frac{Q_o}{2\pi} \right)^2
$$

where $R_s$ is the surface resistance and $Q_o$ is the quality factor at zero frequency. The Geometry Factor is quoted for cavity designs to allow comparison to other designs independent of wall loss, since wall loss for SRF cavities can vary substantially depending on material preparation, cryogenic bath temperature, electromagnetic field level, and other highly variable parameters. The Geometry Factor is also independent of cavity size, it is constant as a cavity shape is scaled to change its frequency.

#### Applications of SRF Cavities

They are also used in MRI machines to generate strong and uniform magnetic fields. The unique properties of superconductors, such as zero electrical resistance and perfect diamagnetism, make SRF cavities ideal for these applications.

The journey of superconducting quantum computing began in the latter half of the 1990s when quantum tunneling across Josephson junctions was discovered. This discovery led to the realization that quantum computing could be achieved through these superconducting qubits.

In 1999, a paper was published by Yasunobu Nakamura, which introduced the initial design of a superconducting qubit known as the "charge qubit". This design served as the basis for later qubit designs and has been further developed to overcome its initial limitations.

#### Superconducting Qubit Design

Superconducting qubits are typically designed using Josephson junctions, which are superconducting devices that exhibit quantum tunneling. These junctions are used to create potential wells that confine particles, such as Cooper pairs, to specific energy levels. The energy separation between these levels is unique and differs from all other interlevel energy separations in the system, making them ideal for use as logical states in a qubit.

One of the primary challenges in superconducting qubit design is shaping the potential well and choosing the particle mass such that the energy separation between two specific energy levels is unique. This is crucial as these two levels are used as logical states of the qubit.

#### Superconducting Quantum Computing Challenges

Superconducting quantum computing faces several challenges, including mitigating quantum noise and leakage. Quantum noise refers to disruptions of the system caused by its interaction with the environment, while leakage refers to information being lost to the surrounding environment.

One way to reduce leakage is through parity measurements. However, this is not without its challenges, as it requires precise control and measurement of the qubit state.

Many current challenges faced by superconducting quantum computing lie in the field of microwave engineering. As superconducting quantum computing approaches larger scale devices, researchers face difficulties in qubit coherence, scalable calibration software, efficient determination of fidelity of quantum states across an entire chip, and qubit and gate fidelity.

#### The Journey of Quantum Sensors

The journey of quantum sensors began in the early 2000s, when researchers began exploring the use of quantum systems for measurement purposes. The first quantum sensors were based on atomic clocks, which use the quantum properties of atoms to measure time with high precision. However, these sensors were limited in their sensitivity and accuracy.

In the late 2000s, researchers began exploring the use of individual quantum systems as measurement devices. This led to the development of superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), which use the quantum properties of superconducting materials to measure magnetic fields with high sensitivity.

#### Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs)

The development of quantum controllers has been a significant challenge in the field of quantum computing. However, recent advancements have led to the development of scalable quantum controllers that can support a growing number of qubits.

#### Decoherence

One of the greatest challenges in building a quantum computer is controlling or removing quantum decoherence. Decoherence occurs when the quantum system interacts with its environment, causing it to lose its quantum properties. This can lead to errors in calculations and limit the performance of the quantum computer.

To address this challenge, researchers have developed various techniques to minimize decoherence, including error correction codes and quantum error correction protocols. These techniques aim to protect the qubits from external disturbances and maintain the integrity of the quantum system.

## Chapter: - Chapter 8: Superconducting Applications:




### Subsection: 8.1a Superconducting magnets in MRI

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive medical imaging technique that uses the magnetic properties of certain materials to generate images of the body's internal structures. The key component of an MRI scanner is the superconducting magnet, which produces a strong and uniform magnetic field.

#### 8.1a.1 Superconducting Magnets in MRI

Superconducting magnets are essential for MRI scanners as they allow for the generation of a strong and uniform magnetic field. This is crucial for obtaining high-quality images. The strength of the magnetic field is measured in teslas (T) and clinical magnets generally have a field strength in the range 0.1â3.0 T, with research systems available up to 9.4 T for human use and 21 T for animal systems.

The precision of the magnet is also important, as fluctuations in the magnetic field can affect the quality of the images. The straightness of the magnetic lines within the center of the magnet, known as homogeneity, should be near-perfect. Fluctuations within the scan region should be less than three parts per million (3 ppm).

#### 8.1a.2 Types of Superconducting Magnets

There are three main types of superconducting magnets used in MRI scanners: resistive magnets, inductive magnets, and resistive-inductive magnets.

Resistive magnets use a resistive coil to generate a magnetic field. These magnets are simple and inexpensive, but they have a limited field strength and can overheat, limiting their use in MRI scanners.

Inductive magnets use an inductive coil to generate a magnetic field. These magnets have a higher field strength than resistive magnets, but they are more expensive and can be difficult to control.

Resistive-inductive magnets combine the advantages of both resistive and inductive magnets. They have a high field strength and can be easily controlled, but they are also expensive.

#### 8.1a.3 Advantages of Superconducting Magnets in MRI

Superconducting magnets offer several advantages over resistive and inductive magnets in MRI scanners. These include:

- Higher field strength: Superconducting magnets can generate a stronger magnetic field, allowing for higher resolution images.
- Uniformity: Superconducting magnets can produce a more uniform magnetic field, reducing image distortion.
- Longer operation time: Superconducting magnets can operate for longer periods without the need for frequent cooling, reducing downtime.
- Lower power consumption: Superconducting magnets require less power to operate, making them more energy-efficient.

#### 8.1a.4 Challenges of Superconducting Magnets in MRI

Despite their advantages, there are also some challenges associated with using superconducting magnets in MRI scanners. These include:

- High cost: Superconducting magnets are expensive to produce and maintain, making them less accessible for some medical facilities.
- Long precooling time: Superconducting magnets require a long precooling time before they can be used, which can be a limitation in certain applications.
- Safety concerns: Superconducting magnets can pose safety risks if they are not properly maintained or if there is a failure in the system.

In conclusion, superconducting magnets play a crucial role in MRI scanners, allowing for the generation of high-quality images. While there are some challenges associated with their use, the advantages they offer make them an essential component of modern medical imaging technology.





### Subsection: 8.1b SQUIDs in magnetoencephalography

Superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) have been widely used in magnetoencephalography (MEG) due to their high sensitivity and ability to measure extremely small magnetic fields. SQUIDs are superconducting devices that operate at extremely low temperatures, typically below 4 Kelvin. They consist of a superconducting loop interrupted by two Josephson junctions. When a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the loop, it induces a current in the loop, which can be measured. This current is proportional to the applied magnetic field, making SQUIDs ideal for measuring extremely small magnetic fields.

#### 8.1b.1 SQUIDs in MEG

In MEG, SQUIDs are used to measure the magnetic fields produced by the brain. The brain produces electric activity, which in turn produces magnetic fields. These magnetic fields can be measured outside the head using SQUIDs. The challenge, however, is to determine the location of the electric activity within the brain from the induced magnetic fields outside the head. This is known as the "inverse problem" and is a subject of intensive research.

#### 8.1b.2 The Inverse Problem in MEG

The inverse problem in MEG is to determine the location of electric activity within the brain from the induced magnetic fields outside the head. This is a challenging problem because the inverse problem does not have a unique solution. There are infinite possible "correct" answers, and the problem of defining the "best" solution is itself the subject of intensive research.

To solve the inverse problem, models involving prior knowledge of brain activity are used. These models can be either over-determined or under-determined. An over-determined model may consist of a few point-like sources ("equivalent dipoles"), whose locations are then estimated from the data. Under-determined models may be used in cases where many different distributed areas are activated ("distributed source solutions"): there are infinitely many possible current distributions explaining the measurement results, but the most likely is selected.

#### 8.1b.3 Localization Algorithms for SQUIDs

Localization algorithms make use of given source and head models to find a likely location for an underlying focal field generator. One type of localization algorithm for overdetermined models operates by expectation-maximization. The system is initialized with a first guess. A loop is started, in which a forward model is used to simulate the magnetic field that would result from the current guess. The guess is adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the simulated field and the measured field. This process is iterated until convergence.

Another common technique is beamforming, wherein a theoretical model of the magnetic field produced by the brain is used to estimate the location of the electric activity. This technique is particularly useful for under-determined models, where there are many possible sources of the magnetic field.

In conclusion, SQUIDs have been instrumental in advancing the field of MEG. Their high sensitivity and ability to measure extremely small magnetic fields have allowed for more accurate and detailed measurements of brain activity. However, the inverse problem in MEG remains a challenging problem, and further research is needed to develop more accurate and reliable methods for source localization.

The main component of an SMES system is a superconducting coil, which is cryogenically cooled to a temperature below its superconducting critical temperature. This allows for the coil to carry a large amount of current without any energy loss due to resistance. The stored energy can then be released back to the network by discharging the coil.

One of the main advantages of SMES is its high efficiency. The round-trip efficiency of SMES is greater than 95%, making it one of the most efficient methods of energy storage.
