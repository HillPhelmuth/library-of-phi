The study of ocean waves and their interaction with various structures has been a subject of interest for centuries. From the early days of navigation, sailors have been aware of the power and unpredictability of the sea. However, it was not until the 19th century that scientists began to systematically study ocean waves. The work of Sir George Gabriel Stokes, a mathematician and physicist, was particularly influential in this field. His studies on the theory of waves, published in 1847, laid the foundation for much of our understanding of ocean waves.

In the 20th century, the study of ocean waves became increasingly important as the world turned its attention to the sea for energy production. The development of wave power technology, such as the Wave Adaptive Self-anchoring Platform (WASP), has opened up new possibilities for harnessing the power of the sea.

In the case of ocean waves, these boundaries can be the surface of a ship or an offshore energy system. Boundary conditions are essential in determining the behavior of waves at these boundaries and can have a significant impact on the overall wave interaction.

Throughout this chapter, we will delve into the details of these conservation laws and boundary conditions and their applications in the study of ocean wave interaction. We will also discuss the various methods and techniques used to analyze and model these interactions, providing a comprehensive guide for readers to understand and apply these principles in their own research and studies.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of the fundamental principles that govern the interaction of ocean waves with ships and offshore energy systems.

The conservation of mass is a fundamental principle in physics that states that the mass of a closed system remains constant over time. This principle is also known as the law of mass conservation and is a direct consequence of the principle of energy conservation. In the context of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems, the conservation of mass plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of waves and their impact on these systems.

#### 1.1a Definition of Mass Conservation

The conservation of mass can be mathematically expressed as:

$$
\frac{dM}{dt} = 0
$$

where $M$ is the mass of a closed system and $t$ is time. This equation states that the rate of change of mass of a closed system is equal to zero, meaning that the mass of the system remains constant over time.

In the context of ocean wave interaction, the conservation of mass is particularly important as it allows us to understand the behavior of waves as they interact with different structures and systems. For example, when a wave breaks on a ship or an offshore energy system, the mass of the wave is transferred to the system, and the conservation of mass ensures that the total mass of the system remains constant.

Furthermore, the conservation of mass is also crucial in understanding the behavior of waves at boundaries. For instance, when a wave hits the surface of a ship or an offshore energy system, the mass of the wave is transferred to the system, and the conservation of mass ensures that the total mass of the system remains constant. This is particularly important in the design and analysis of these systems, as it allows us to predict the behavior of waves and their impact on the system.

# Cauchy momentum equation

## Differential derivation

Let us start with the generalized momentum conservation principle which can be written as follows: "The change in system momentum is proportional to the resulting force acting on this system". It is expressed by the formula:

<math display="block">\vec p(t+\Delta t) - \vec p(t) = \Delta t \vec\bar F</math>

where <math>\vec p(t)</math> is momentum in time `t`, <math>\vec\bar F</math> is force averaged over <math>\Delta t</math>. After dividing by <math>\Delta t</math> and passing to the limit <math>\Delta t \to 0</math> we get (derivative):

<math display="block">\frac{d\vec p}{dt} = \vec F</math>

Let us analyse each side of the equation above.

### Right side

We split the forces into body forces <math>\vec F_m</math> and surface forces <math>\vec F_p</math>

<math display="block">\vec F=\vec F_p + \vec F_m</math>

Surface forces act on walls of the cubic fluid element. For each wall, the "X" component of these forces was marked in the figure with a cubic element (in the form of a product of stress and surface area e.g. <math>-\sigma_{xx} \, dy \, dz</math> with units <math display="inline">\mathrm{Pa\cdot m\cdot m = \frac{N}{m^2} \cdot m^2 = N}</math>).

Adding forces (their "X" components) acting on each of the cube walls, we get:

<math display="block">F_p^x =
\left(\sigma_{xx}+\frac{\partial\sigma_{xx}}{\partial x}dx\right)dy\,dz
-\sigma_{xx}dy\,dz
+\left(\sigma_{yx}+\frac{\partial\sigma_{yx}}{\partial y}dy\right)dx\,dz
-\sigma_{yx}dx\,dz
+\left(\sigma_{zx}+\frac{\partial\sigma_{zx}}{\partial z}dz\right)dx\,dy
-\sigma_{zx}dx\,dy
</math>

After ordering <math>F_p^x</math> and performing similar reasoning for components <math>F_p^y, F_p^z</math> (they have not been shown in the figure, but these would be vectors parallel to the Y and Z axes, respectively) we get:

F_p^x &= \frac{\partial\sigma_{xx}}{\partial x}\,dx\,dy\,dz
+ \frac{\partial\sigma_{yx}}{\partial y}\,dx\,dy\,dz
+ \frac{\partial\sigma_{zx}}{\partial z}\,dx\,dy\,dz

### Subsection: 1.2b Momentum Conservation in Waves

In the previous section, we discussed the conservation of momentum in a fluid element. In this section, we will explore how this principle applies to ocean waves and their interaction with ships and offshore energy systems.

#### 1.2b.1 Momentum Conservation in Waves

Ocean waves are a complex phenomenon that involves the transfer of energy and momentum from one point to another. The conservation of momentum is a fundamental principle that governs the behavior of these waves. 

The momentum of a wave can be defined as the product of its momentum density and its volume. The momentum density of a wave is given by the equation:

$$
\rho \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = \rho \left(\frac{\partial \vec{v}}{\partial t} + \vec{v} \cdot \nabla \vec{v}\right)
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the wave, $\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the wave, and $\nabla$ is the gradient operator.

The volume of a wave is given by the equation:

$$
\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \vec{v} \cdot \nabla V
$$

where $V$ is the volume of the wave.

By combining these equations, we can derive the equation for the conservation of momentum in waves:

$$
\rho \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt} = \rho \left(\frac{\partial \vec{v}}{\partial t} + \vec{v} \cdot \nabla \vec{v}\right) = \frac{\partial (\rho \vec{v})}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \vec{v} \vec{v})
$$

This equation states that the rate of change of momentum of a wave is equal to the divergence of the momentum flux. This principle is fundamental to understanding the behavior of ocean waves and their interaction with ships and offshore energy systems.

#### 1.2b.2 Applications of Momentum Conservation in Waves

The principle of momentum conservation in waves has many applications in the field of ocean engineering. For example, it can be used to analyze the interaction between waves and ships, where the momentum of the waves can be transferred to the ship, causing it to move. This principle can also be used to design offshore energy systems, where the momentum of the waves can be harnessed to generate electricity.

In addition, the principle of momentum conservation in waves can also be used to understand the behavior of tsunamis, where the momentum of the waves can cause significant damage to coastal structures. By applying the principle of momentum conservation, engineers can design structures that can withstand these forces and minimize the impact of tsunamis.

In conclusion, the principle of momentum conservation is a fundamental concept in the study of ocean waves and their interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. By understanding this principle, engineers can design more efficient and resilient systems that can withstand the forces of the ocean.




#### 1.2c Momentum Conservation Equations

The momentum conservation equations are a set of equations that describe the conservation of momentum in a system. These equations are derived from the principle of conservation of momentum, which states that the total momentum of a system remains constant unless acted upon by an external force.

The momentum conservation equations are given by:

$$
\frac{\partial (\rho \vec{v})}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \vec{v} \vec{v}) = \vec{F}
$$

where $\vec{F}$ is the external force acting on the system.

These equations can be applied to a variety of systems, including ocean waves, ships, and offshore energy systems. In the context of ocean waves, these equations can be used to describe the transfer of momentum between the wave and the surrounding fluid. In the case of ships and offshore energy systems, these equations can be used to describe the forces acting on the system and how they affect the system's motion.

The momentum conservation equations are a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of physical systems. They allow us to predict how a system will respond to external forces and how these forces will affect the system's motion. In the following sections, we will explore how these equations can be applied to various systems and how they can be used to solve practical problems in ocean engineering.




#### 1.3a Energy Conservation in Waves

The conservation of energy is a fundamental principle in physics that states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or converted from one form to another. In the context of ocean waves, this principle is crucial in understanding the behavior of waves and their interaction with ships and offshore energy systems.

The energy of a wave is defined as the product of its kinetic energy and potential energy. The kinetic energy of a wave is given by the equation:

$$
KE = \frac{1}{2}\rho gA^2\omega
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $A$ is the amplitude of the wave, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the wave.

The potential energy of a wave is given by the equation:

$$
PE = \frac{1}{2}\rho gA^2\omega^2
$$

The total energy of a wave is then given by the sum of the kinetic and potential energies:

$$
E = KE + PE = \frac{1}{2}\rho gA^2\omega(1 + \omega)
$$

The conservation of energy in waves can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\vec{v} E) = 0
$$

where $\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the wave. This equation states that the rate of change of energy in a wave is equal to the divergence of the energy flux.

In the context of ocean waves, the conservation of energy is crucial in understanding the behavior of waves and their interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. For example, when a wave interacts with a ship or an offshore energy system, energy is transferred from the wave to the system. This energy transfer can be calculated using the principles of energy conservation.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of energy conservation in more detail and discuss its applications in the study of ocean waves, ships, and offshore energy systems.

#### 1.3b Energy Transfer in Waves

The concept of energy transfer in waves is closely related to the principle of energy conservation. As we have seen, the total energy of a wave is conserved, but it can be transferred from one form to another. In the context of ocean waves, this energy transfer can occur due to various factors such as wave-wave interactions, wave-current interactions, and wave-structure interactions.

Wave-wave interactions occur when two waves of different frequencies interact with each other. This can lead to the formation of new waves with different frequencies, known as wave-wave interactions. The energy transfer in these interactions can be described by the wave-wave interaction equation:

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\vec{v} E) = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} (\frac{1}{2}\rho gA^2\omega(1 + \omega)) + \nabla \cdot (\vec{v} (\frac{1}{2}\rho gA^2\omega(1 + \omega))) = 0
$$

Wave-current interactions occur when a wave interacts with a current in the fluid. This can lead to the transfer of energy from the wave to the current, or vice versa. The energy transfer in these interactions can be described by the wave-current interaction equation:

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\vec{v} E) = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} (\frac{1}{2}\rho gA^2\omega(1 + \omega)) + \nabla \cdot (\vec{v} (\frac{1}{2}\rho gA^2\omega(1 + \omega))) = 0
$$

Wave-structure interactions occur when a wave interacts with a structure, such as a ship or an offshore energy system. This can lead to the transfer of energy from the wave to the structure, or vice versa. The energy transfer in these interactions can be described by the wave-structure interaction equation:

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\vec{v} E) = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} (\frac{1}{2}\rho gA^2\omega(1 + \omega)) + \nabla \cdot (\vec{v} (\frac{1}{2}\rho gA^2\omega(1 + \omega))) = 0
$$

These equations show that the energy transfer in waves is governed by the principles of energy conservation. They also highlight the importance of understanding wave-wave, wave-current, and wave-structure interactions in the study of ocean waves, ships, and offshore energy systems.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of energy dissipation in waves, which is another important aspect of energy conservation in waves.

#### 1.3c Energy Dissipation in Waves

The concept of energy dissipation in waves is closely related to the principle of energy conservation. While energy is conserved in wave-wave, wave-current, and wave-structure interactions, it is not always the case that all the energy is transferred from one form to another. Some energy is always lost in these interactions, and this loss of energy is known as energy dissipation.

Energy dissipation in waves can occur due to various factors such as wave breaking, wave-structure interactions, and wave-current interactions. 

Wave breaking occurs when the amplitude of a wave becomes so large that the wave breaks and dissipates its energy into the surrounding fluid. This can lead to the formation of turbulence, which can further dissipate energy. The energy dissipation due to wave breaking can be described by the wave breaking equation:

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\vec{v} E) = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} (\frac{1}{2}\rho gA^2\omega(1 + \omega)) + \nabla \cdot (\vec{v} (\frac{1}{2}\rho gA^2\omega(1 + \omega))) = 0
$$

Wave-structure interactions can also lead to energy dissipation. As mentioned earlier, when a wave interacts with a structure, energy can be transferred from the wave to the structure. However, not all the energy is transferred. Some energy is always lost in this interaction, and this loss of energy is known as energy dissipation. The energy dissipation in these interactions can be described by the wave-structure interaction equation:

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\vec{v} E) = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} (\frac{1}{2}\rho gA^2\omega(1 + \omega)) + \nabla \cdot (\vec{v} (\frac{1}{2}\rho gA^2\omega(1 + \omega))) = 0
$$

Wave-current interactions can also lead to energy dissipation. As mentioned earlier, when a wave interacts with a current in the fluid, energy can be transferred from the wave to the current. However, not all the energy is transferred. Some energy is always lost in this interaction, and this loss of energy is known as energy dissipation. The energy dissipation in these interactions can be described by the wave-current interaction equation:

$$
\frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\vec{v} E) = \frac{\partial}{\partial t} (\frac{1}{2}\rho gA^2\omega(1 + \omega)) + \nabla \cdot (\vec{v} (\frac{1}{2}\rho gA^2\omega(1 + \omega))) = 0
$$

These equations show that the energy dissipation in waves is governed by the principles of energy conservation. They also highlight the importance of understanding wave breaking, wave-structure, and wave-current interactions in the study of ocean waves, ships, and offshore energy systems.




#### 1.3b Energy Transfer in Waves

The concept of energy transfer in waves is crucial in understanding the behavior of waves and their interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. When a wave interacts with a system, energy is transferred from the wave to the system. This energy transfer can be calculated using the principles of energy conservation.

The energy transfer in waves can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\Delta E = \frac{\partial E}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\vec{v} E)
$$

where $\Delta E$ is the change in energy, $\frac{\partial E}{\partial t}$ is the rate of change of energy, and $\nabla \cdot (\vec{v} E)$ is the divergence of the energy flux.

In the context of ocean waves, the energy transfer can be visualized as the transfer of energy from the ocean to the ship or offshore energy system. This energy transfer can be calculated using the principles of energy conservation and the equations of motion for the wave and the system.

The equations of motion for the wave and the system can be derived from the conservation laws and boundary conditions. These equations describe the motion of the wave and the system in response to the forces acting on them. The forces acting on the wave and the system can be calculated using the principles of fluid dynamics and the equations of motion for the wave and the system.

The equations of motion for the wave and the system can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\rho \frac{D\vec{v}}{Dt} = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \vec{v} + \rho \vec{g}
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $\vec{v}$ is the velocity of the wave or the system, $p$ is the pressure, $\mu$ is the viscosity, $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian operator, and $\vec{g}$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

The equations of motion for the wave and the system can be used to calculate the forces acting on the wave and the system. These forces can then be used to calculate the energy transfer in the wave and the system.

#### 1.3c Applications in Wave Energy Systems

The principles of energy conservation and the equations of motion for waves and systems have numerous applications in the field of wave energy systems. These systems are designed to harness the energy of ocean waves and convert it into usable forms of energy such as electricity.

One of the most promising applications of wave energy systems is in the generation of electricity. Wave energy converters (WECs) are devices that are designed to capture the energy of ocean waves and convert it into electricity. These devices can be designed to operate in a variety of ocean conditions, from small, low-energy waves to large, high-energy waves.

The design of WECs is a complex process that involves a deep understanding of the principles of energy conservation and the equations of motion for waves and systems. The design process begins with the selection of a suitable site for the WEC. This site must have the appropriate ocean conditions for the operation of the WEC. The site must also be located in such a way that the WEC does not interfere with other marine activities or the environment.

Once a suitable site has been selected, the design of the WEC can begin. The design process involves the application of the principles of energy conservation and the equations of motion for waves and systems. The design must ensure that the WEC can capture the energy of the waves and convert it into electricity with maximum efficiency.

The design of the WEC also involves the application of the principles of structural engineering. The WEC must be designed to withstand the forces exerted on it by the waves. These forces can be calculated using the equations of motion for the wave and the system. The WEC must also be designed to withstand the forces exerted on it by the wind and the currents in the ocean.

The design of the WEC also involves the application of the principles of electrical engineering. The WEC must be designed to convert the energy of the waves into electricity with maximum efficiency. This involves the design of the electrical components of the WEC, such as the generators and the transformers.

In conclusion, the principles of energy conservation and the equations of motion for waves and systems have numerous applications in the field of wave energy systems. These principles are essential for the design and operation of wave energy converters.




### Subsection: 1.4a Definition of Boundary Conditions

Boundary conditions play a crucial role in the study of waves and systems. They are mathematical conditions that must be satisfied at the boundaries of a system. These conditions are necessary to determine the behavior of the system and to solve the equations of motion for the system.

In the context of wave energy systems, boundary conditions are used to define the behavior of the system at the boundaries of the system. These boundaries can be physical, such as the surface of the ocean, or they can be conceptual, such as the interface between different layers of the ocean.

The boundary conditions for a wave energy system can be classified into two types: essential and natural. Essential boundary conditions are those that must be satisfied at the boundaries of the system. These conditions are often derived from physical laws, such as the laws of conservation of energy and momentum.

Natural boundary conditions, on the other hand, are those that are satisfied by the system without the need for external intervention. These conditions are often derived from the properties of the system, such as its symmetry or its response to external forces.

The boundary conditions for a wave energy system can be expressed mathematically as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Essential boundary conditions:} \quad & f(x) = g(x), \quad x \in \partial \Omega \\
\text{Natural boundary conditions:} \quad & h(x) = 0, \quad x \in \partial \Omega
\end{align*}
$$

where $\partial \Omega$ is the boundary of the system, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are functions defined on the boundary, and $h(x)$ is a function that describes the behavior of the system at the boundary.

The boundary conditions for a wave energy system are used to solve the equations of motion for the system. These equations can be written in the following general form:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Essential boundary conditions:} \quad & \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0, \quad x = 0 \\
\text{Natural boundary conditions:} \quad & \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0, \quad x = 1
\end{align*}
$$

where $u(x)$ is the displacement of the system at position $x$.

The boundary conditions for a wave energy system are also used to determine the behavior of the system at the boundaries. This behavior can be described by the following equations:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Essential boundary conditions:} \quad & u(x) = 0, \quad x = 0 \\
\text{Natural boundary conditions:} \quad & u(x) = 0, \quad x = 1
\end{align*}
$$

where $u(x)$ is the displacement of the system at position $x$.

In the next section, we will discuss the application of boundary conditions to wave energy systems.

### Subsection: 1.4b Types of Boundary Conditions

In the previous section, we discussed the definition of boundary conditions and their importance in the study of waves and systems. In this section, we will delve deeper into the types of boundary conditions that can be applied to wave energy systems.

#### Essential Boundary Conditions

Essential boundary conditions are those that must be satisfied at the boundaries of the system. These conditions are often derived from physical laws, such as the laws of conservation of energy and momentum. They are essential in determining the behavior of the system and solving the equations of motion for the system.

For example, in the context of wave energy systems, an essential boundary condition could be the requirement that the wave energy at the boundaries of the system remains constant. This condition can be expressed mathematically as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Essential boundary conditions:} \quad & E(x) = E_0, \quad x \in \partial \Omega
\end{align*}
$$

where $E(x)$ is the wave energy at position $x$, and $E_0$ is a constant.

#### Natural Boundary Conditions

Natural boundary conditions, on the other hand, are those that are satisfied by the system without the need for external intervention. These conditions are often derived from the properties of the system, such as its symmetry or its response to external forces.

For instance, in the context of wave energy systems, a natural boundary condition could be the requirement that the wave energy at the boundaries of the system is proportional to the wave energy at the center of the system. This condition can be expressed mathematically as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Natural boundary conditions:} \quad & E(x) = kE_0, \quad x \in \partial \Omega
\end{align*}
$$

where $k$ is a constant.

#### Mixed Boundary Conditions

In some cases, a system may require both essential and natural boundary conditions. These are known as mixed boundary conditions. For example, in the context of wave energy systems, a mixed boundary condition could be the requirement that the wave energy at the boundaries of the system remains constant, while the wave energy at the center of the system is proportional to the wave energy at the boundaries. This condition can be expressed mathematically as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Mixed boundary conditions:} \quad & E(x) = E_0, \quad x \in \partial \Omega \\
& E(x) = kE_0, \quad x \in \Omega
\end{align*}
$$

where $k$ is a constant.

In the next section, we will discuss how these boundary conditions can be applied to solve the equations of motion for wave energy systems.

### Subsection: 1.4c Applications in Wave Energy Systems

In this section, we will explore the application of boundary conditions in wave energy systems. The understanding of these conditions is crucial in the design and operation of wave energy systems. 

#### Wave Energy Converters

Wave energy converters (WECs) are devices that convert the kinetic energy of waves into electrical energy. The design of these devices is heavily influenced by the boundary conditions at the water surface and at the seafloor.

For instance, the Adomian decomposition method, as applied to the Blasius equation, provides a mathematical framework for understanding the behavior of WECs. The method allows us to express the solution of the equation in a simple way, which can be useful in the design of WECs.

The Adomian decomposition method involves the use of linear and non-linear operators, denoted as $L$ and $N$ respectively. These operators are defined as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
L &= \frac{\mathrm{d}^{3} }{\mathrm{d} x^{3}} \\
N &= \frac{1}{2} u \frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}}{\mathrm{d}x^{2}}
\end{align*}
$$

The solution of the Blasius equation can then be expressed as:

$$
u = \alpha + \beta x + \gamma x^{2}/2 - L^{-1} N u
$$

where $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ are constants, and $L^{-1}$ is the inverse of the linear operator $L$.

#### Wave Energy Storage

The boundary conditions also play a crucial role in the storage of wave energy. For example, the requirement that the wave energy at the boundaries of the system remains constant can be expressed as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Essential boundary conditions:} \quad & E(x) = E_0, \quad x \in \partial \Omega
\end{align*}
$$

This condition can be used to design wave energy storage systems that can efficiently store and release wave energy.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the application of boundary conditions in the design and operation of wave energy systems.

## Chapter 2: Wave Propagation

### Introduction

The second chapter of "Ocean Wave Interaction with Ships and Offshore Energy Systems: A Comprehensive Guide" delves into the fascinating world of wave propagation. This chapter is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of how waves travel across the ocean, interacting with ships and offshore energy systems along the way.

Wave propagation is a fundamental concept in the study of ocean waves. It is the process by which waves move through space and time, carrying energy and momentum. This chapter will explore the mathematical models that describe wave propagation, including the wave equation and the dispersion relation. These models are essential tools for predicting wave behavior and understanding wave-structure interactions.

The chapter will also discuss the effects of wave propagation on ships and offshore energy systems. Ships, for instance, experience wave-induced motions that can lead to structural fatigue and failure. Understanding wave propagation is crucial for designing ships that can withstand these motions. Similarly, offshore energy systems, such as wind turbines and wave energy converters, are subject to wave-induced forces that can affect their performance and reliability.

In addition, this chapter will touch on the role of wave propagation in the generation of ocean wave spectra. Ocean wave spectra are statistical representations of wave fields that provide valuable information about wave characteristics, such as their directionality, spectral density, and spectral slope. The generation of these spectra is a complex process that involves wave propagation, and this chapter will provide insights into this process.

Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of wave propagation, its effects on ships and offshore energy systems, and its role in the generation of ocean wave spectra. By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid foundation in these concepts and be able to apply them in practical situations.




### Subsection: 1.4b Boundary Conditions in Wave Dynamics

In the study of wave dynamics, boundary conditions play a crucial role in determining the behavior of waves at the boundaries of a system. These boundaries can be physical, such as the surface of the ocean, or conceptual, such as the interface between different layers of the ocean.

The boundary conditions for wave dynamics can be classified into two types: essential and natural. Essential boundary conditions are those that must be satisfied at the boundaries of the system. These conditions are often derived from physical laws, such as the laws of conservation of energy and momentum.

Natural boundary conditions, on the other hand, are those that are satisfied by the system without the need for external intervention. These conditions are often derived from the properties of the system, such as its symmetry or its response to external forces.

The boundary conditions for wave dynamics can be expressed mathematically as follows:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Essential boundary conditions:} \quad & f(x) = g(x), \quad x \in \partial \Omega \\
\text{Natural boundary conditions:} \quad & h(x) = 0, \quad x \in \partial \Omega
\end{align*}
$$

where $\partial \Omega$ is the boundary of the system, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are functions defined on the boundary, and $h(x)$ is a function that describes the behavior of the system at the boundary.

The boundary conditions for wave dynamics are used to solve the equations of motion for the system. These equations can be written in the following general form:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Essential boundary conditions:} \quad & \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0, \quad x = 0 \\
\text{Natural boundary conditions:} \quad & \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0, \quad x = L
\end{align*}
$$

where $u(x)$ is the displacement of the wave at position $x$, and $L$ is the length of the system.

These boundary conditions are essential for understanding the behavior of waves at the boundaries of a system. They allow us to determine the response of the system to external forces and to predict the propagation of waves within the system.




### Subsection: 1.4c Boundary Conditions in Wave Energy Systems

In the context of wave energy systems, boundary conditions play a crucial role in determining the behavior of waves at the boundaries of the system. These boundaries can be physical, such as the surface of the ocean, or conceptual, such as the interface between different layers of the ocean.

The boundary conditions for wave energy systems can be classified into two types: essential and natural.

\text{Natural boundary conditions:} \quad & h(x) = 0, \quad x \in \partial \Omega
\end{align*}
$$

where $\partial \Omega$ is the boundary of the system, $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are functions defined on the boundary, and $h(x)$ is a function that describes the behavior of the system at the boundary.

The boundary conditions for wave energy systems are used to solve the equations of motion for the system. These equations can be written in the following general form:

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Essential boundary conditions:} \quad & \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0, \quad x = 0 \\
\text{Natural boundary conditions:} \quad & \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0, \quad x = L
\end{align*}
$$

where $u(x)$ is the displacement of the wave at position $x$, and $L$ is the length of the system.

These boundary conditions are essential for understanding the behavior of waves at the boundaries of a wave energy system. They are used to solve the equations of motion for the system, and to understand the behavior of the system under different conditions.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the fundamental concepts of linear and second-order wave theory, which are essential for understanding the complex interactions between ocean waves and ships or offshore energy systems. These theories provide a mathematical framework for describing the behavior of waves, which is crucial for predicting and mitigating the effects of waves on these systems.

Linear wave theory is a simplified model that assumes the waves are small and the water is deep. It is based on the linearization of the wave equations, which allows us to derive analytical solutions. These solutions are useful for understanding the basic principles of wave propagation and interaction with structures.

Second-order wave theory, on the other hand, is a more advanced model that takes into account the nonlinear effects of waves. It is based on the nonlinear wave equations, which cannot be solved analytically. Therefore, numerical methods are used to solve these equations and obtain more accurate predictions of wave behavior.

Throughout this chapter, we will explore these theories in detail, starting with the basic principles and equations, and then moving on to more advanced topics such as wave reflection, refraction, and interaction with structures. We will also discuss the limitations and applications of these theories, and how they are used in practice.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of the mathematical foundations of wave theory and be able to apply these concepts to the analysis and design of ships and offshore energy systems.




### Section: 2.1 Linear Wave Theory:

Linear wave theory is a fundamental concept in the study of ocean waves. It is based on the assumption that the waves are small and the water is deep. This allows us to linearize the wave equations, making them easier to solve analytically. In this section, we will explore the basic principles of linear wave theory, including the wave equation, wave propagation, and wave reflection.

#### 2.1a Definition of Linear Waves

Linear waves are a type of wave that can be described by linear wave theory. They are characterized by their small amplitude and the assumption that the water is deep. This allows us to linearize the wave equations, making them easier to solve analytically.

The wave equation is a second-order linear partial differential equation that describes the propagation of waves. In the context of linear wave theory, the wave equation can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $\eta$ is the wave elevation, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the wave speed.

The wave equation can be derived from the basic principles of fluid dynamics, including the conservation of mass and momentum. It describes the propagation of waves in a fluid medium, such as water.

In the next section, we will explore the solutions to the wave equation and how they represent the propagation of waves in the ocean.

#### 2.1b Wave Propagation

Wave propagation is the process by which waves travel through a medium. In the context of linear wave theory, we are interested in the propagation of waves in the ocean. The wave propagation can be described by the wave equation, which we have already introduced.

The wave equation describes the propagation of waves in a homogeneous and isotropic medium. However, in the ocean, the medium is not always homogeneous and isotropic. The ocean is a complex medium with varying properties, such as density, temperature, and salinity. These variations can affect the propagation of waves and need to be taken into account in the wave equation.

To account for these variations, we can introduce the concept of dispersion. Dispersion is the phenomenon where the phase speed of a wave depends on its frequency. In the ocean, dispersion can be caused by variations in the properties of the medium, such as density and temperature.

The wave equation can be modified to account for dispersion. The modified wave equation is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} = c^2(x) \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $c(x)$ is the phase speed of the wave, which depends on the frequency of the wave.

In the next section, we will explore the solutions to the modified wave equation and how they represent the propagation of waves in the ocean.

#### 2.1c Wave Reflection

Wave reflection is another important aspect of linear wave theory. It refers to the process by which waves are returned into the medium from which they originated. In the context of ocean waves, wave reflection can occur at the ocean surface, at the seafloor, or at the interface between layers of different properties.

The reflection of waves can be described by the Fresnel equations, which are a set of equations that describe the reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves at an interface. The Fresnel equations can be extended to describe the reflection of waves in the ocean, although they are typically used for electromagnetic waves.

The Fresnel equations can be written as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\Gamma_r &= \frac{n_1 \cos(\theta_i) - n_2 \cos(\theta_t)}{n_1 \cos(\theta_i) + n_2 \cos(\theta_t)} \\
\Gamma_t &= \frac{2 n_1 \cos(\theta_i)}{n_1 \cos(\theta_i) + n_2 \cos(\theta_t)}
\end{align*}
$$

where $\Gamma_r$ and $\Gamma_t$ are the reflection and transmission coefficients, respectively, $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the refractive indices of the two media, and $\theta_i$ and $\theta_t$ are the angles of incidence and transmission, respectively.

In the context of ocean waves, the Fresnel equations can be used to describe the reflection of waves at the ocean surface or at the interface between layers of different properties. However, it is important to note that the Fresnel equations are based on the assumption of a smooth and flat interface, which is not always the case in the ocean.

In the next section, we will explore the solutions to the wave equation in the presence of wave reflection and how they represent the propagation of waves in the ocean.

#### 2.1d Wave Interaction

Wave interaction is a fundamental concept in linear wave theory. It refers to the process by which waves interact with each other or with the medium in which they propagate. In the context of ocean waves, wave interaction can occur between waves of different frequencies, between waves and the ocean floor, or between waves and the surface of the ocean.

The interaction of waves can be described by the nonlinear wave equations, which are a set of equations that describe the propagation of waves in a nonlinear medium. The nonlinear wave equations can be written as:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + c \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \eta^2 \right) &= 0 \\
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + c \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \eta^2 \right) + \frac{1}{6} \frac{\partial^3 \eta}{\partial x^3} &= 0
\end{align*}
$$

where $\eta$ is the wave elevation, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the phase speed of the wave.

The nonlinear wave equations describe the propagation of waves in a nonlinear medium, such as the ocean. They account for the effects of wave-wave interaction, wave-bottom interaction, and wave-surface interaction.

In the context of ocean waves, the nonlinear wave equations can be used to describe the interaction of waves of different frequencies, the interaction of waves with the ocean floor, and the interaction of waves with the surface of the ocean. However, it is important to note that the nonlinear wave equations are based on the assumption of a smooth and continuous medium, which is not always the case in the ocean.

In the next section, we will explore the solutions to the nonlinear wave equations and how they represent the propagation of waves in the ocean.

#### 2.1e Wave Interaction Examples

In this section, we will explore some examples of wave interaction in the ocean. These examples will illustrate the concepts of wave-wave interaction, wave-bottom interaction, and wave-surface interaction as described by the nonlinear wave equations.

##### Wave-Wave Interaction

Wave-wave interaction occurs when waves of different frequencies interact with each other. This can lead to the formation of new waves, the transfer of energy between waves, and the modification of the wave field.

Consider two waves of different frequencies propagating in the ocean. According to the nonlinear wave equations, the interaction between these waves can be described by the terms $\eta^2$ and $\partial \eta / \partial x$. These terms represent the nonlinear effects of wave-wave interaction, such as wave steepening and wave breaking.

##### Wave-Bottom Interaction

Wave-bottom interaction occurs when waves interact with the ocean floor. This can lead to the generation of secondary waves, the modification of the wave field, and the transfer of energy from the primary waves to the ocean floor.

Consider a wave propagating over a rough bottom. The interaction between the wave and the bottom can be described by the term $\partial \eta / \partial x$. This term represents the linear effects of wave-bottom interaction, such as wave diffraction and wave reflection.

##### Wave-Surface Interaction

Wave-surface interaction occurs when waves interact with the surface of the ocean. This can lead to the generation of secondary waves, the modification of the wave field, and the transfer of energy from the primary waves to the surface of the ocean.

Consider a wave propagating over the surface of the ocean. The interaction between the wave and the surface can be described by the term $\eta^2$. This term represents the nonlinear effects of wave-surface interaction, such as wave breaking and wave steepening.

In the next section, we will explore the solutions to these examples and how they represent the propagation of waves in the ocean.

#### 2.1f Wave Interaction Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the fundamental concepts of linear wave theory and its applications in understanding wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. We have delved into the mathematical models that describe wave propagation, reflection, and refraction, and how these models can be used to predict wave behavior in various scenarios.

We have also discussed the importance of understanding wave interaction in the design and operation of ships and offshore energy systems. By understanding the principles of wave interaction, engineers can design more efficient and robust systems that can withstand the forces exerted by waves.

In the next chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic of wave interaction and explore the concept of second-order wave theory. This theory provides a more comprehensive understanding of wave behavior and is particularly useful in dealing with non-linear wave phenomena.




#### 2.1b Wave Propagation

Wave propagation is a fundamental concept in linear wave theory. It describes the movement of waves through a medium, such as the ocean. In this section, we will explore the principles of wave propagation and how they relate to the wave equation.

The wave equation, as we have seen, describes the propagation of waves in a medium. However, in the ocean, the medium is not always homogeneous and isotropic. The ocean is a complex medium with varying properties, such as density, temperature, and salinity. These variations can affect the propagation of waves and must be taken into account when studying wave propagation in the ocean.

One of the key principles of wave propagation is the concept of wave speed. The wave speed, denoted by $c$, is the speed at which a wave propagates through a medium. In the ocean, the wave speed can vary depending on the properties of the water. For example, waves travel faster in warmer water than in colder water.

Another important concept in wave propagation is the wavelength, denoted by $\lambda$. The wavelength is the distance between two consecutive peaks or troughs of a wave. In the ocean, the wavelength can also vary depending on the properties of the water. For example, waves with longer wavelengths tend to travel faster than waves with shorter wavelengths.

The wave equation can be used to calculate the wave speed and wavelength of a wave in a given medium. By solving the wave equation, we can determine the propagation characteristics of a wave, such as its speed and wavelength.

In addition to the wave speed and wavelength, there are other factors that can affect wave propagation in the ocean. These include the depth of the water, the presence of currents, and the shape of the ocean floor. These factors can cause waves to refract, or change direction, as they propagate through the ocean.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of wave reflection and how it relates to wave propagation in the ocean.

#### 2.1c Wave Reflection

Wave reflection is another important aspect of wave propagation in the ocean. It occurs when a wave encounters a boundary between two different media, such as water and air, and is reflected back into the water. This phenomenon is described by the law of reflection, which states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.

The law of reflection can be mathematically represented as:

$$
\theta_i = \theta_r
$$

where $\theta_i$ is the angle of incidence and $\theta_r$ is the angle of reflection. Both angles are measured from the normal to the boundary.

In the context of wave reflection, the law of reflection can be applied to the reflection of ocean waves. When a wave encounters the shoreline, for example, it is reflected back into the ocean. The angle of incidence is determined by the angle of the shoreline relative to the direction of the wave, while the angle of reflection is determined by the angle of the shoreline relative to the direction of the reflected wave.

Wave reflection can also occur when a wave encounters a change in water depth. In this case, the law of reflection can be applied to the reflection of the wave off the bottom of the ocean. The angle of incidence is determined by the angle of the bottom relative to the direction of the wave, while the angle of reflection is determined by the angle of the bottom relative to the direction of the reflected wave.

In addition to the law of reflection, there are other factors that can affect wave reflection in the ocean. These include the presence of currents, the shape of the ocean floor, and the properties of the water. These factors can cause waves to reflect in complex patterns, making it challenging to predict their behavior.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of wave transmission and how it relates to wave propagation in the ocean.

#### 2.1d Wave Transmission

Wave transmission is the process by which waves are transmitted from one medium to another. In the context of ocean waves, this can occur when a wave passes from the ocean into the atmosphere, or when a wave passes from the ocean into the shoreline. The transmission of waves is governed by the principles of wave propagation and reflection, as well as the properties of the media involved.

The transmission of waves can be described mathematically using the wave equation. The wave equation describes the propagation of waves in a medium, and can be used to calculate the wave speed and wavelength of a wave in a given medium. In the case of wave transmission, the wave equation can be used to calculate the transmission of a wave from one medium to another.

The wave equation can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $\eta$ is the wave elevation, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the wave speed. The wave speed $c$ is a function of the properties of the medium, and can change when a wave is transmitted from one medium to another.

In the case of wave transmission from the ocean into the atmosphere, the wave speed $c$ is determined by the properties of the air. The wave speed in air is typically much lower than the wave speed in water, which can cause the wave to lose energy as it is transmitted into the atmosphere. This phenomenon is known as wave dissipation.

In the case of wave transmission from the ocean into the shoreline, the wave speed $c$ is determined by the properties of the shoreline. The wave speed can change rapidly as the wave moves from the deep ocean into shallow water, which can cause the wave to break and dissipate. This phenomenon is known as wave breaking.

In addition to the wave equation, the principles of wave reflection also play a role in wave transmission. When a wave is transmitted from one medium to another, it can be reflected back into the first medium. This can occur, for example, when a wave is transmitted from the ocean into the atmosphere, and is reflected back into the ocean due to the difference in wave speed between the two media.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of wave dissipation and wave breaking in more detail, and discuss their implications for wave propagation in the ocean.

#### 2.1e Wave Interaction with Ships

The interaction of ocean waves with ships is a critical aspect of ship design and operation. This interaction can have significant effects on the performance and safety of a ship, and understanding these effects is essential for designing ships that can withstand the forces exerted by ocean waves.

The interaction of ocean waves with ships can be described using the principles of wave propagation and reflection, as well as the properties of the ship and the wave. The wave equation, which describes the propagation of waves in a medium, can be used to calculate the wave speed and wavelength of a wave in a given medium. In the case of wave interaction with ships, the wave equation can be used to calculate the interaction of a wave with the ship.

The wave equation can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $\eta$ is the wave elevation, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the wave speed. The wave speed $c$ is a function of the properties of the medium, and can change when a wave interacts with a ship.

In the case of wave interaction with ships, the wave speed $c$ is determined by the properties of the ship. The wave speed in a ship is typically much lower than the wave speed in water, which can cause the wave to lose energy as it interacts with the ship. This phenomenon is known as wave dissipation.

The interaction of waves with ships can also cause the ship to experience forces, known as wave forces, which can affect the ship's motion and stability. These forces can be calculated using the principles of wave propagation and reflection, and can be used to design ships that can withstand these forces.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of wave dissipation and wave forces in more detail, and discuss their implications for ship design and operation.

#### 2.1f Wave Interaction with Offshore Energy Systems

The interaction of ocean waves with offshore energy systems is a critical aspect of energy production and safety. This interaction can have significant effects on the performance and reliability of these systems, and understanding these effects is essential for designing systems that can withstand the forces exerted by ocean waves.

The interaction of ocean waves with offshore energy systems can be described using the principles of wave propagation and reflection, as well as the properties of the system and the wave. The wave equation, which describes the propagation of waves in a medium, can be used to calculate the wave speed and wavelength of a wave in a given medium. In the case of wave interaction with offshore energy systems, the wave equation can be used to calculate the interaction of a wave with the system.

The wave equation can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $\eta$ is the wave elevation, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the wave speed. The wave speed $c$ is a function of the properties of the medium, and can change when a wave interacts with an offshore energy system.

In the case of wave interaction with offshore energy systems, the wave speed $c$ is determined by the properties of the system. The wave speed in a system is typically much lower than the wave speed in water, which can cause the wave to lose energy as it interacts with the system. This phenomenon is known as wave dissipation.

The interaction of waves with offshore energy systems can also cause the system to experience forces, known as wave forces, which can affect the system's motion and stability. These forces can be calculated using the principles of wave propagation and reflection, and can be used to design systems that can withstand these forces.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of wave dissipation and wave forces in more detail, and discuss their implications for offshore energy systems.

One of the key applications of linear wave theory is in the design and analysis of offshore structures. These structures, such as oil rigs and wind turbines, are subject to the forces exerted by ocean waves. By understanding the principles of linear wave theory, engineers can design structures that can withstand these forces and operate safely in the ocean.

Linear wave theory is also used in the study of wave propagation in the ocean. By solving the wave equation, researchers can determine the speed and wavelength of waves in different ocean conditions. This information is crucial for predicting the behavior of waves and their impact on ships and offshore structures.

Another important application of linear wave theory is in the study of wave reflection and refraction. As waves propagate through the ocean, they can encounter changes in the properties of the water, such as changes in depth or temperature. These changes can cause the waves to reflect or refract, changing their direction and potentially impacting ships and offshore structures. By understanding the principles of wave reflection and refraction, researchers can predict these changes and design structures that can withstand them.

Linear wave theory also has applications in the study of wave-structure interaction. This involves understanding how waves interact with offshore structures, such as oil rigs and wind turbines. By applying the principles of linear wave theory, researchers can predict the forces exerted by waves on these structures and design them to withstand these forces.

In addition to these applications, linear wave theory is also used in the study of wave-ship interaction. This involves understanding how waves interact with ships and how these interactions can affect the stability and safety of the ship. By applying the principles of linear wave theory, researchers can predict these interactions and design ships that can operate safely in the ocean.

In conclusion, linear wave theory has a wide range of applications in the study of ocean waves and their interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. By understanding the principles of linear wave theory, researchers can design and analyze structures that can withstand the forces exerted by ocean waves and predict the behavior of waves in different ocean conditions. 





#### 2.2a Definition of Second-Order Waves

Second-order waves are a type of wave that is described by the second-order wave equation. This equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation that describes the propagation of waves in a medium. It is a more accurate representation of wave propagation than the linear wave equation, as it takes into account the nonlinear effects that can occur in real-world systems.

The second-order wave equation is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} \right)^2
$$

where $\phi$ is the wave function, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the wave speed. The first term on the right-hand side represents the linear wave propagation, while the second term represents the nonlinear effects.

Second-order waves are important in the study of ocean waves and their interaction with ships and offshore energy systems.

One of the most significant properties of second-order waves is their nonlinear propagation. Unlike linear waves, which propagate at a constant speed, second-order waves can exhibit variations in their speed and direction due to the nonlinear effects represented by the second-order wave equation. This can lead to phenomena such as wave steepening and shock formation, which can have significant implications for the behavior of waves in real-world systems.

##### Dispersion

Another important property of second-order waves is their dispersion. Dispersion refers to the dependence of the wave speed on the frequency of the wave. In linear systems, the dispersion is typically a linear function of the frequency. However, in second-order systems, the dispersion can be a nonlinear function, leading to complex wave phenomena such as wave packet spreading and group velocity dispersion.

##### Wave-Wave Interactions

Second-order waves also exhibit complex wave-wave interactions that are not present in linear systems. These interactions can lead to phenomena such as wave steepening, wave breaking, and the formation of solitons. These interactions can have significant implications for the behavior of waves in real-world systems, particularly in the context of ocean waves and their interaction with ships and offshore energy systems.

##### Solitons

Solitons are a unique type of second-order wave that exhibit a stable, solitary wave packet that maintains its shape while propagating at a constant speed. Solitons are a result of the balance between dispersion and nonlinearity in the second-order wave equation. They have been observed in various physical systems, including optical fibers and shallow water waves, and their study is an active area of research in nonlinear wave theory.

In the next section, we will explore the methods for solving the second-order wave equation and the applications of second-order wave theory in the study of ocean waves.

#### 2.3a Wave Reflection Mechanisms

Wave reflection is a fundamental concept in the study of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. It refers to the phenomenon where a wave, upon encountering a boundary, is partially or completely turned back into the medium from which it originated. This section will delve into the mechanisms of wave reflection, focusing on the reflection of ocean waves at the sea surface.

##### Reflection at the Sea Surface

The sea surface is a complex boundary that interacts with ocean waves in a variety of ways. The reflection of ocean waves at the sea surface is a critical aspect of wave interaction, as it determines the distribution of wave energy in the ocean.

The reflection of ocean waves at the sea surface can be understood in terms of the wave's incident angle and the sea surface's slope. The incident angle is the angle between the wave's direction of travel and the normal to the sea surface. The sea surface's slope is the angle between the sea surface and the horizontal.

The reflection coefficient, denoted by $r$, is a dimensionless quantity that describes the fraction of the incident wave that is reflected at the sea surface. It is defined as the ratio of the reflected wave amplitude to the incident wave amplitude. The reflection coefficient is a function of the incident angle and the sea surface's slope.

The reflection coefficient can be calculated using the Fresnel equations, which are a set of equations that describe the reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves at an interface. The Fresnel equations are given by:

$$
r = \frac{c_2 - c_1}{c_2 + c_1}
$$

where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are the wave speeds in the two media, and $c_2$ is the wave speed in the sea surface.

The reflection coefficient is a complex quantity, and its magnitude and phase depend on the incident angle and the sea surface's slope. The magnitude of the reflection coefficient represents the fraction of the incident wave that is reflected, while the phase of the reflection coefficient represents the phase shift that the reflected wave experiences upon reflection.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of wave transmission, which is the complement of wave reflection. Wave transmission refers to the phenomenon where a wave, upon encountering a boundary, is partially or completely transmitted into the other medium.

#### 2.3b Wave Transmission Coefficient

The wave transmission coefficient, denoted by $t$, is another crucial parameter in the study of wave reflection and transmission. It describes the fraction of the incident wave that is transmitted into the sea surface. Similar to the reflection coefficient, the transmission coefficient is a function of the incident angle and the sea surface's slope.

The transmission coefficient can be calculated using the Fresnel equations, which are a set of equations that describe the reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves at an interface. The Fresnel equations are given by:

$$

#### 2.3c Wave Reflection and Transmission at Interfaces

The reflection and transmission of waves at interfaces is a fundamental concept in the study of wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. This phenomenon occurs when a wave encounters a boundary between two different media, such as the sea surface or the hull of a ship. The reflection and transmission of waves at these interfaces can significantly affect the propagation of waves and the dynamics of the system.

The reflection and transmission of waves at interfaces can be described using the Fresnel equations, which are a set of equations that describe the reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves at an interface. The Fresnel equations are given by:

$$
r = \frac{c_2 - c_1}{c_2 + c_1}
$$

$$
t = \frac{2c_1}{c_2 + c_1}
$$

where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are the wave speeds in the two media, and $c_2$ is the wave speed in the sea surface.

The reflection coefficient, denoted by $r$, describes the fraction of the incident wave that is reflected at the interface. The transmission coefficient, denoted by $t$, describes the fraction of the incident wave that is transmitted into the interface. Both coefficients are complex quantities, and their magnitude and phase depend on the incident angle and the properties of the media.

#### 2.3b Wave Transmission Mechanisms

Wave transmission is another fundamental concept in the study of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. It refers to the phenomenon where a wave, upon encountering a boundary, is partially or completely transmitted into the medium beyond the boundary. This section will delve into the mechanisms of wave transmission, focusing on the transmission of ocean waves at the sea surface.

##### Transmission at the Sea Surface

The sea surface, like the reflection of ocean waves, is a complex boundary that interacts with ocean waves in a variety of ways. The transmission of ocean waves at the sea surface is a critical aspect of wave interaction, as it determines the distribution of wave energy in the ocean.

The transmission of ocean waves at the sea surface can be understood in terms of the wave's incident angle and the sea surface's slope. The incident angle is the angle between the wave's direction of travel and the normal to the sea surface. The sea surface's slope is the angle between the sea surface and the horizontal.

The transmission coefficient, denoted by $t$, is a dimensionless quantity that describes the fraction of the incident wave that is transmitted at the sea surface. It is defined as the ratio of the transmitted wave amplitude to the incident wave amplitude. The transmission coefficient is a function of the incident angle and the sea surface's slope.

The transmission coefficient can be calculated using the Fresnel equations, which are a set of equations that describe the reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves at an interface. The Fresnel equations are given by:

$$
t = \frac{2c_1}{c_2 + c_1}
$$

where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are the wave speeds in the two media, and $c_2$ is the wave speed in the sea surface.

The transmission coefficient is a complex quantity, and its magnitude and phase depend on the incident angle and the sea surface's slope. The magnitude of the transmission coefficient represents the fraction of the incident wave that is transmitted at the sea surface.

##### Wave Transmission and Reflection

The total wave energy at the sea surface is the sum of the reflected wave energy and the transmitted wave energy. This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
E_{total} = E_{reflected} + E_{transmitted}
$$

where $E_{total}$ is the total wave energy, $E_{reflected}$ is the reflected wave energy, and $E_{transmitted}$ is the transmitted wave energy.

The reflection coefficient and transmission coefficient satisfy the following relationship:

$$
|r|^2 + |t|^2 = 1
$$

This relationship ensures the conservation of wave energy at the sea surface.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of wave absorption and its role in wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems.

#### 2.3c Wave Reflection and Transmission Coefficients

The reflection and transmission coefficients are crucial in understanding the behavior of waves at the sea surface. These coefficients are complex quantities that describe the fraction of the incident wave that is reflected or transmitted at the sea surface. 

##### Reflection Coefficient

The reflection coefficient, denoted by $r$, is a dimensionless quantity that describes the fraction of the incident wave that is reflected at the sea surface. It is defined as the ratio of the reflected wave amplitude to the incident wave amplitude. The reflection coefficient is a function of the incident angle and the sea surface's slope.

The reflection coefficient can be calculated using the Fresnel equations, which are a set of equations that describe the reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves at an interface. The Fresnel equations are given by:

$$
r = \frac{c_2 - c_1}{c_2 + c_1}
$$

where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are the wave speeds in the two media, and $c_2$ is the wave speed in the sea surface.

The reflection coefficient is a complex quantity, and its magnitude and phase depend on the incident angle and the sea surface's slope. The magnitude of the reflection coefficient represents the fraction of the incident wave that is reflected at the sea surface.

##### Transmission Coefficient

The transmission coefficient, denoted by $t$, is a dimensionless quantity that describes the fraction of the incident wave that is transmitted at the sea surface. It is defined as the ratio of the transmitted wave amplitude to the incident wave amplitude. The transmission coefficient is a function of the incident angle and the sea surface's slope.

The transmission coefficient can be calculated using the Fresnel equations, which are a set of equations that describe the reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves at an interface. The Fresnel equations are given by:

$$
t = \frac{2c_1}{c_2 + c_1}
$$

where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are the wave speeds in the two media, and $c_2$ is the wave speed in the sea surface.

The transmission coefficient is a complex quantity, and its magnitude and phase depend on the incident angle and the sea surface's slope. The magnitude of the transmission coefficient represents the fraction of the incident wave that is transmitted at the sea surface.

##### Relationship between Reflection and Transmission Coefficients

The total wave energy at the sea surface is the sum of the reflected wave energy and the transmitted wave energy. This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
|r|^2 + |t|^2 = 1
$$

This relationship ensures the conservation of wave energy at the sea surface. It also implies that the sum of the reflection and transmission coefficients is always equal to 1, regardless of the incident angle and the sea surface's slope.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of wave absorption and its role in wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems.




#### 2.3c Reflection and Transmission Coefficients

The reflection and transmission coefficients are fundamental concepts in the study of wave interaction with boundaries. They describe the fraction of the incident wave that is reflected and transmitted at the boundary, respectively. 

##### Reflection Coefficient

The reflection coefficient, denoted by $r$, is a dimensionless quantity that describes the fraction of the incident wave that is reflected at the boundary. It is defined as the ratio of the reflected wave amplitude to the incident wave amplitude. The reflection coefficient is a function of the incident angle and the boundary's properties.

The reflection coefficient can be calculated using the Fresnel equations, which are a set of equations that describe the reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves at an interface. The Fresnel equations are given by:

$$

$$

where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are the wave speeds in the two media, and $c_2$ is the wave speed in the boundary.

##### Transmission Coefficient

The transmission coefficient, denoted by $t$, is a dimensionless quantity that describes the fraction of the incident wave that is transmitted at the boundary. It is defined as the ratio of the transmitted wave amplitude to the incident wave amplitude. The transmission coefficient is a function of the incident angle and the boundary's properties.

The transmission coefficient can be calculated using the Fresnel equations, which are a set of equations that describe the reflection and transmission of electromagnetic waves at an interface. The Fresnel equations are given by:

$$
t = \frac{2c_1}{c_2 + c_1}
$$

where $c_1$ and $c_2$ are the wave speeds in the two media, and $c_2$ is the wave speed in the boundary.

The transmission coefficient is a complex quantity, and its magnitude and phase depend on the incident angle and the boundary's properties. The magnitude of the transmission coefficient is always less than 1, indicating that some of the incident wave is always reflected at the boundary. The phase of the transmission coefficient can be positive or negative, depending on whether the transmitted wave is in phase or out of phase with the incident wave.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of wave reflection and transmission in the context of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems.




#### 2.4a Definition of Wave Dispersion

Wave dispersion is a fundamental concept in the study of wave propagation. It refers to the phenomenon where waves of different wavelengths or frequencies travel at different speeds. This is in contrast to non-dispersive waves, where all waves travel at the same speed regardless of their wavelength or frequency.

In the context of ocean waves, dispersion is a critical factor that influences the interaction of waves with ships and offshore energy systems. The dispersion of ocean waves can be understood in terms of the wave's phase speed and group speed.

##### Phase Speed

The phase speed of a wave is the speed at which a point of constant phase of the wave travels. It is given by the ratio of the wave's frequency to its wavenumber, as shown in the equation:

$$
v_{\rm p} = \frac{\omega}{k}
$$

where $\omega$ is the angular frequency and $k$ is the wavenumber. The phase speed is a function of the wave's frequency and wavelength, and it can vary significantly for different waves.

##### Group Speed

The group speed of a wave is the speed at which the wave's amplitude or energy propagates. It is given by the derivative of the wave's dispersion relation with respect to its wavenumber. The group speed is a function of the wave's frequency and wavelength, and it can also vary significantly for different waves.

The dispersion of ocean waves is typically described by the dispersion relation, which is a mathematical expression that relates the wave's frequency to its wavenumber. The dispersion relation can be linear or nonlinear, depending on the wave's properties and the medium in which it propagates.

In the next sections, we will delve deeper into the concept of wave dispersion, exploring its implications for wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. We will also discuss the mathematical models used to describe wave dispersion, including the linear and nonlinear wave theories.

#### 2.4b Wave Dispersion Models

Wave dispersion models are mathematical representations of the dispersion relation. These models are used to describe the propagation of waves in a medium, such as the ocean. The dispersion relation is a fundamental concept in wave theory, and it is used to calculate the phase speed and group speed of a wave.

##### Linear Wave Dispersion Models

Linear wave dispersion models are based on the assumption that the wave's amplitude is small and that the wave's properties can be described by linear equations. These models are often used for long waves in deep water, where the wave's amplitude is typically small compared to the water depth.

The dispersion relation for linear waves is given by the equation:

$$
\omega = \sqrt{gk}
$$

where $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $k$ is the wavenumber. This equation shows that the phase speed of a linear wave is proportional to the square root of its wavenumber. This means that waves with larger wavenumbers (shorter wavelengths) travel faster than waves with smaller wavenumbers (longer wavelengths).

##### Nonlinear Wave Dispersion Models

Nonlinear wave dispersion models are used to describe waves with larger amplitudes or waves in shallow water, where the wave's properties cannot be accurately described by linear equations. These models are often used for short waves in shallow water, where the wave's amplitude can be significant compared to the water depth.

The dispersion relation for nonlinear waves is typically more complex than the dispersion relation for linear waves. It often involves higher-order terms in the wave's amplitude and wavenumber. For example, the dispersion relation for shallow water waves is given by the equation:

$$
\omega = \sqrt{gk + \frac{1}{2}k^2h}
$$

where $h$ is the water depth. This equation shows that the phase speed of a nonlinear wave is proportional to the square root of its wavenumber and the water depth. This means that waves with larger wavenumbers (shorter wavelengths) and larger water depths travel faster than waves with smaller wavenumbers (longer wavelengths) and smaller water depths.

In the next section, we will discuss the implications of wave dispersion for the interaction of waves with ships and offshore energy systems.

#### 2.4c Wave Dispersion in Shallow Water

In the previous sections, we have discussed the dispersion of waves in deep water and nonlinear waves. Now, we will focus on the dispersion of waves in shallow water. Shallow water refers to a water body where the water depth is smaller than the wavelength of the wave. This condition significantly affects the wave's dispersion and propagation.

##### Shallow Water Wave Dispersion

The dispersion relation for shallow water waves is given by the equation:

$$
\omega = \sqrt{gk + \frac{1}{2}k^2h}
$$

where $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $k$ is the wavenumber, and $h$ is the water depth. This equation shows that the phase speed of a shallow water wave is proportional to the square root of its wavenumber and the water depth. This means that waves with larger wavenumbers (shorter wavelengths) and larger water depths travel faster than waves with smaller wavenumbers (longer wavelengths) and smaller water depths.

The dispersion relation for shallow water waves also shows that the phase speed increases with the square of the wavenumber. This means that waves with larger wavenumbers (shorter wavelengths) experience a larger increase in phase speed compared to waves with smaller wavenumbers (longer wavelengths). This phenomenon is known as wave steepening and is a characteristic feature of shallow water waves.

##### Wave Steepening

Wave steepening is a nonlinear effect that occurs when the wave's amplitude becomes large enough to affect the wave's dispersion. This effect is particularly pronounced in shallow water, where the wave's amplitude can significantly affect the wave's phase speed.

The wave steepening effect can be understood by considering the wave's dispersion relation. As the wave's amplitude increases, the wave's wavenumber also increases, leading to an increase in the wave's phase speed. This increase in phase speed can cause the wave's amplitude to increase even further, leading to a positive feedback loop. This feedback loop can result in the formation of steep waves, which can break and dissipate energy.

In the next section, we will discuss the implications of wave dispersion and steepening for the interaction of waves with ships and offshore energy systems.

#### 2.4d Wave Dispersion in Deep Water

In the previous sections, we have discussed the dispersion of waves in shallow water and nonlinear waves. Now, we will focus on the dispersion of waves in deep water. Deep water refers to a water body where the water depth is larger than the wavelength of the wave. This condition significantly affects the wave's dispersion and propagation.

##### Deep Water Wave Dispersion

The dispersion relation for deep water waves is given by the equation:

$$
\omega = \sqrt{gk}
$$

where $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $k$ is the wavenumber. This equation shows that the phase speed of a deep water wave is proportional to the square root of its wavenumber. This means that waves with larger wavenumbers (shorter wavelengths) travel faster than waves with smaller wavenumbers (longer wavelengths).

The dispersion relation for deep water waves also shows that the phase speed increases with the square root of the wavenumber. This means that waves with larger wavenumbers (shorter wavelengths) experience a larger increase in phase speed compared to waves with smaller wavenumbers (longer wavelengths). This phenomenon is known as wave steepening and is a characteristic feature of deep water waves.

##### Wave Steepening

Wave steepening is a nonlinear effect that occurs when the wave's amplitude becomes large enough to affect the wave's dispersion. This effect is particularly pronounced in deep water, where the wave's amplitude can significantly affect the wave's phase speed.

The wave steepening effect can be understood by considering the wave's dispersion relation. As the wave's amplitude increases, the wave's wavenumber also increases, leading to an increase in the wave's phase speed. This increase in phase speed can cause the wave's amplitude to increase even further, leading to a positive feedback loop. This feedback loop can result in the formation of steep waves, which can break and dissipate energy.

In the next section, we will discuss the implications of wave dispersion and steepening for the interaction of waves with ships and offshore energy systems.

## Chapter: Nonlinear Wave Theory

### Introduction

The study of waves is a fundamental aspect of many scientific and engineering disciplines, including but not limited to, oceanography, meteorology, and civil engineering. In the previous chapters, we have explored the linear wave theory, which is a simplified model that assumes the waves to be small and the medium to be homogeneous and isotropic. However, in many real-world scenarios, these assumptions are not always valid. This is where the nonlinear wave theory comes into play.

In this chapter, we will delve into the nonlinear wave theory, which is a more comprehensive model that can handle larger waves and non-uniform media. The nonlinear wave theory is a complex field that involves the study of wave propagation, wave interaction, and wave breaking. It is a crucial tool for understanding and predicting the behavior of waves in various physical systems.

We will begin by introducing the basic concepts of nonlinear wave theory, including the nonlinear wave equation and the concept of wave steepening. We will then explore the phenomena of wave breaking and wave interaction, which are fundamental to the understanding of wave propagation in nonlinear systems.

Next, we will discuss the methods for solving the nonlinear wave equation, including the method of characteristics and the finite difference method. These methods are essential for numerical simulations of wave propagation in nonlinear systems.

Finally, we will discuss the applications of nonlinear wave theory in various fields, including oceanography, meteorology, and civil engineering. We will also touch upon the current research trends in nonlinear wave theory and the future directions of research in this field.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to nonlinear wave theory, equipping the reader with the necessary knowledge and tools to understand and predict the behavior of waves in nonlinear systems. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or a professional in a related field, we hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource for you.




#### 2.4b Wave Dispersion Models

Wave dispersion models are mathematical representations of the relationship between the frequency and wavenumber of a wave. These models are essential in understanding the behavior of waves in different mediums, including the ocean. In this section, we will discuss some of the most commonly used wave dispersion models.

##### The Kolsky Model

The Kolsky model, also known as the Kolsky basic model, is a mathematical model used to describe the dispersion of waves in a medium. It is based on the assumption that the wave's phase velocity is inversely proportional to its frequency. The model is given by the equation:

$$
v_{\rm p} = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{1}{k} \sqrt{gk}
$$

where $v_{\rm p}$ is the phase speed, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $k$ is the wavenumber, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. The Kolsky model is often used to describe the dispersion of waves in deep water, where the effects of the seafloor and the water surface are negligible.

##### The Modified Kolsky Model

The modified Kolsky model is an extension of the basic Kolsky model that takes into account the effects of the seafloor and the water surface. It is given by the equation:

$$
v_{\rm p} = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{1}{k} \sqrt{gk + \frac{g}{k} \left( \frac{k_0}{k} \right)^2}
$$

where $k_0$ is the wavenumber at the water surface. The modified Kolsky model is often used to describe the dispersion of waves in shallow water, where the effects of the seafloor and the water surface cannot be neglected.

##### The Multiple-Prism Dispersion Theory

The multiple-prism dispersion theory is a mathematical model used to describe the dispersion of waves in a medium with multiple interfaces. It is based on the principle of angular dispersion, which states that the phase velocity of a wave is inversely proportional to its wavelength. The theory is given by the equation:

$$
v_{\rm p} = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{1}{k} \sqrt{gk + \frac{g}{k} \left( \frac{k_0}{k} \right)^2 + \frac{g}{k} \left( \frac{k_1}{k} \right)^2}
$$

where $k_1$ is the wavenumber at the first interface. The multiple-prism dispersion theory is often used to describe the dispersion of waves in complex media, such as the ocean, where the effects of multiple interfaces cannot be neglected.

In the next section, we will discuss the applications of these wave dispersion models in the design of ships and offshore energy systems.

#### 2.4c Dispersion in Shallow Water

Dispersion in shallow water is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by a variety of factors, including the water depth, the wavelength of the wave, and the properties of the seafloor. In this section, we will discuss the dispersion of waves in shallow water, focusing on the effects of the seafloor and the water surface.

##### The Shallow Water Equation

The shallow water equation is a simplified form of the Navier-Stokes equations that describes the motion of water in a horizontal layer. It is given by the equation:

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + c \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{f_0} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{g}{f_0} \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} \right) = 0
$$

where $\eta$ is the surface elevation, $t$ is time, $x$ is the horizontal coordinate, $c$ is the phase speed of the wave, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $f_0$ is the Coriolis parameter. The shallow water equation describes the propagation of long waves in a horizontal layer of fluid, and it is often used to study the dispersion of waves in shallow water.

##### The Effects of the Seafloor

The seafloor plays a crucial role in the dispersion of waves in shallow water. The dispersion of waves is influenced by the wavelength of the wave and the properties of the seafloor. In general, the dispersion of waves increases with the wavelength of the wave and the roughness of the seafloor.

The dispersion of waves can be described by the multiple-prism dispersion theory, which is given by the equation:

$$
v_{\rm p} = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{1}{k} \sqrt{gk + \frac{g}{k} \left( \frac{k_0}{k} \right)^2 + \frac{g}{k} \left( \frac{k_1}{k} \right)^2}
$$

where $k_0$ is the wavenumber at the water surface and $k_1$ is the wavenumber at the seafloor. The multiple-prism dispersion theory takes into account the effects of the seafloor and the water surface, and it is often used to describe the dispersion of waves in shallow water.

##### The Effects of the Water Surface

The water surface also plays a crucial role in the dispersion of waves in shallow water. The dispersion of waves is influenced by the wavelength of the wave and the properties of the water surface. In general, the dispersion of waves increases with the wavelength of the wave and the roughness of the water surface.

The dispersion of waves can be described by the modified Kolsky model, which is given by the equation:

$$
v_{\rm p} = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{1}{k} \sqrt{gk + \frac{g}{k} \left( \frac{k_0}{k} \right)^2}
$$

where $k_0$ is the wavenumber at the water surface. The modified Kolsky model takes into account the effects of the water surface, and it is often used to describe the dispersion of waves in shallow water.

In the next section, we will discuss the dispersion of waves in deep water, focusing on the effects of the water column and the properties of the seafloor.




#### 2.4c Effects of Dispersion on Wave Propagation

Wave dispersion is a phenomenon that affects the propagation of waves in a medium. It is the dependence of the phase velocity of a wave on its frequency. In the previous section, we discussed some of the commonly used wave dispersion models, including the Kolsky model and the multiple-prism dispersion theory. In this section, we will explore the effects of dispersion on wave propagation.

##### Dispersion and Wave Speed

As we have seen in the previous section, the phase velocity of a wave is inversely proportional to its frequency in the Kolsky model. This means that higher frequency waves will travel faster than lower frequency waves. This is a key characteristic of dispersion and is what distinguishes it from non-dispersive media, where the phase velocity is independent of frequency.

In the multiple-prism dispersion theory, the phase velocity is also inversely proportional to the frequency, but with an additional term that accounts for the effects of multiple interfaces. This term can lead to more complex dispersion patterns, depending on the properties of the interfaces.

##### Dispersion and Wave Energy

Dispersion also affects the distribution of wave energy in a medium. In a dispersive medium, different frequency components of a wave will travel at different speeds. This can lead to the spreading of the wave energy over time, a phenomenon known as wave spreading.

In the context of ocean waves, this can have significant implications for the energy transfer between different parts of the ocean. For example, in the North Atlantic, the dispersion of ocean waves can lead to the transfer of energy from the deep ocean to the surface, which can affect the ocean's mixing and heat transport properties.

##### Dispersion and Wave Interactions

Dispersion can also affect the interactions between waves. In a dispersive medium, different frequency components of a wave can interact with each other and with waves of different frequencies. This can lead to phenomena such as wave steepening and wave breaking, which can have significant implications for the propagation of waves in the ocean.

In the context of offshore energy systems, understanding the effects of dispersion on wave interactions is crucial for predicting the behavior of waves around these systems. This can help in the design of more efficient and robust energy systems.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical models that describe wave dispersion and how these models can be used to predict the effects of dispersion on wave propagation.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the study of plane progressive regular waves, a fundamental aspect of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. These waves are characterized by their uniformity and predictability, making them an essential component in the design and operation of various marine structures.

We will begin by defining what plane progressive regular waves are and how they differ from other types of waves. We will then explore the mathematical models that describe these waves, including the wave equation and the dispersion relation. These models will be presented in the popular Markdown format, using the $ and $$ delimiters to insert math expressions in TeX and LaTeX style syntax. This content is then rendered using the highly popular MathJax library.

Next, we will discuss the properties of plane progressive regular waves, such as their wavelength, frequency, and amplitude. We will also examine how these properties are influenced by factors such as water depth and wave steepness.

Finally, we will look at the practical applications of plane progressive regular waves in the field of ocean engineering. This includes their role in the design of ships and offshore energy systems, as well as their use in wave prediction and mitigation.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of plane progressive regular waves and their importance in the study of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. This knowledge will serve as a solid foundation for the subsequent chapters, which will delve deeper into more complex wave phenomena.




#### 3.1a Characteristics of Regular Waves

Regular waves, also known as progressive waves, are a type of wave that propagate through a medium without changing their shape. They are characterized by their uniformity and predictability, making them an essential component in the design and operation of various marine structures.

#### Wavelength and Frequency

The wavelength ($\lambda$) and frequency ($f$) are two fundamental properties of regular waves. The wavelength is the distance between successive peaks or troughs of the wave, while the frequency is the number of cycles that pass a given point in one second. These properties are related by the equation:

$$
\lambda = \frac{c}{f}
$$

where $c$ is the speed of the wave.

#### Amplitude

The amplitude of a wave is the maximum displacement of the wave from its equilibrium position. It is a measure of the energy of the wave. The amplitude of a regular wave is typically small compared to the wavelength, and it is often assumed to be constant across the wave.

#### Dispersion

Dispersion is the phenomenon where waves of different wavelengths travel at different speeds. In the case of regular waves, the speed of the wave is dependent on its wavelength. This can be represented by the dispersion relation:

$$
c = c(f)
$$

where $c$ is the speed of the wave and $f$ is the frequency.

#### Water Depth and Wave Steepness

The properties of regular waves are influenced by the water depth and the wave steepness. The wave steepness, defined as the ratio of the wave height to the wavelength, affects the wave's ability to propagate. In deep water, where the water depth is greater than half the wavelength, the wave steepness is small, and the wave can propagate without significant energy loss. However, in shallow water, where the water depth is less than half the wavelength, the wave steepness is large, and the wave can break, leading to energy dissipation.

#### Practical Applications

The study of regular waves is crucial in the field of ocean engineering. Regular waves are used in the design of ships and offshore energy systems. They are also used in wave prediction and mitigation, particularly in the design of coastal structures and harbors.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical models that describe regular waves, including the wave equation and the dispersion relation.

#### 3.1b Regular Wave Propagation

Regular waves propagate through a medium, carrying energy and momentum. The propagation of regular waves is governed by the wave equation, which describes how the wave's properties change over time and space.

#### Wave Equation

The wave equation for regular waves in deep water is given by:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $\eta$ is the wave elevation, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the speed of the wave. This equation describes how the wave elevation changes over time and space, and it is a fundamental tool in the study of regular waves.

#### Wave Propagation in Deep Water

In deep water, where the water depth is greater than half the wavelength, the wave propagation is primarily in the horizontal direction. The wave's energy is primarily in the horizontal direction, and the wave's amplitude decreases with depth. This is due to the wave's interaction with the bottom boundary, which causes energy dissipation.

#### Wave Propagation in Shallow Water

In shallow water, where the water depth is less than half the wavelength, the wave propagation is more complex. The wave's energy is distributed in both the horizontal and vertical directions, and the wave's amplitude can increase with depth. This is due to the wave's interaction with the bottom boundary, which can cause wave reflection and refraction.

#### Wave Propagation in Shallow Water with a Sloping Bottom

In shallow water with a sloping bottom, the wave propagation can be even more complex. The wave's energy can be reflected and refracted by the bottom boundary, leading to wave energy dissipation and redistribution. This can be described by the wave equation with additional terms representing the wave's interaction with the bottom boundary.

#### Wave Propagation in Shallow Water with a Sloping Bottom

In shallow water with a sloping bottom, the wave propagation can be even more complex. The wave's energy can be reflected and refracted by the bottom boundary, leading to wave energy dissipation and redistribution. This can be described by the wave equation with additional terms representing the wave's interaction with the bottom boundary.

#### 3.1b Regular Wave Equations

The study of regular waves involves understanding the equations that govern their propagation. These equations are derived from the fundamental principles of fluid dynamics and wave theory. In this section, we will discuss the regular wave equations and their implications for wave propagation.

#### The Wave Equation

The wave equation is a second-order linear partial differential equation that describes the propagation of a variety of waves, such as sound waves, light waves, and water waves. For regular waves, the wave equation can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x^2}
$$

where $\eta$ is the wave elevation, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the wave speed.

#### The Dispersion Relation

The dispersion relation is a mathematical expression that relates the wave speed to the wave frequency and wavelength. For regular waves, the dispersion relation can be written as:

$$
c = \sqrt{\frac{g \lambda}{2\pi}}
$$

where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\lambda$ is the wavelength, and $\pi$ is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter.

#### The Wave Steepness

The wave steepness, defined as the ratio of the wave height to the wavelength, is a crucial parameter in the study of regular waves. It affects the wave's ability to propagate and can lead to wave breaking in shallow water. The wave steepness can be calculated using the equation:

$$
S = \frac{H}{\lambda}
$$

where $H$ is the wave height and $\lambda$ is the wavelength.

#### The Shallow Water Approximation

In shallow water, where the water depth is less than half the wavelength, the wave steepness is large, and the wave can break. This can be approximated by the shallow water approximation, which assumes that the wave speed is equal to the square root of the product of the acceleration due to gravity and the water depth. This approximation can be written as:

$$
c \approx \sqrt{g h}
$$

where $h$ is the water depth.

#### The Deep Water Approximation

In deep water, where the water depth is greater than half the wavelength, the wave steepness is small, and the wave can propagate without significant energy loss. This can be approximated by the deep water approximation, which assumes that the wave speed is equal to the square root of the product of the acceleration due to gravity and the wavelength. This approximation can be written as:

$$
c \approx \sqrt{g \lambda}
$$

These equations provide a mathematical framework for understanding the propagation of regular waves. They are fundamental to the study of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems.




#### 3.1c Applications of Regular Waves

Regular waves have a wide range of applications in various fields, including but not limited to, oceanography, civil engineering, and offshore energy systems. In this section, we will discuss some of these applications in more detail.

#### Oceanography

In oceanography, regular waves are used to study ocean currents, wave propagation, and wave breaking. The wave steepness, as discussed in the previous section, is a crucial parameter in these studies. For instance, the wave steepness can be used to predict wave breaking, which is a significant factor in the mixing of the ocean's surface waters.

#### Civil Engineering

In civil engineering, regular waves are used in the design and analysis of structures such as bridges, dams, and coastal defenses. The wave steepness is particularly important in these applications, as it affects the wave's ability to propagate and can lead to wave breaking, which can cause structural damage.

#### Offshore Energy Systems

In the field of offshore energy systems, regular waves are used in the design and analysis of offshore structures such as oil rigs and wave energy converters. The wave steepness is a critical parameter in these applications, as it affects the wave's ability to propagate and can lead to wave breaking, which can cause structural damage.

#### Wave Energy Converters

Wave energy converters (WECs) are devices that convert the kinetic energy of waves into electrical energy. The design and analysis of WECs require a deep understanding of regular waves, including their propagation, steepness, and breaking.

#### Wave Breaking

Wave breaking is a complex phenomenon that is still not fully understood. However, it is known that wave breaking is more likely to occur when the wave steepness is large, which is often the case in shallow water. The study of wave breaking is crucial for many applications, including the design of offshore structures and the prediction of ocean currents.

In conclusion, regular waves play a crucial role in many fields, and their study is essential for understanding and predicting various phenomena. The wave steepness, in particular, is a key parameter in these applications, and its understanding is crucial for the successful application of regular waves in these fields.




#### 3.2a Definition of Wave Height and Period

Wave height and period are fundamental parameters in the study of ocean waves. They provide crucial information about the wave's energy, propagation, and potential for breaking.

#### Wave Height

The wave height, denoted as "H", is the vertical distance between the crest (highest point) and the trough (lowest point) of a wave. It is a measure of the wave's amplitude and is directly related to the wave's energy. The larger the wave height, the more energy the wave carries.

In fluid dynamics, the wave height is defined as the difference between the elevations of a crest and a neighboring trough. This definition is used by mariners, as well as in coastal, ocean, and naval engineering.

In the context of regular waves, the wave height can be defined in different ways depending on the context. For instance, the significant wave height ("H"<sub>s</sub>) is defined as the mean wave height of the highest third of the waves. It is usually defined as four times the standard deviation of the surface elevation, or equivalently as four times the square root of the zeroth-order moment (area) of the wave spectrum. The symbol "H"<sub>m0</sub> is used for this latter definition.

Another wave-height statistic in common usage is the root-mean-square (or RMS) wave height "H"<sub>rms</sub>, defined as:

$$
H_\text{rms} = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{m=1}^N H_m^2},
$$

with "H"<sub>m</sub> again denoting the individual wave heights in a certain time series.

#### Wave Period

The wave period, denoted as "T", is the time it takes for a wave to complete one full oscillation. It is a measure of the wave's frequency and is inversely related to the wave's wavelength. The longer the period, the lower the frequency and the larger the wavelength.

The wave period is a crucial parameter in the study of ocean waves. It affects the wave's speed, energy, and potential for breaking. The wave period can be calculated from the wave height and wavelength using the formula:

$$
T = \frac{\lambda}{c},
$$

where "λ" is the wavelength and "c" is the wave speed.

In the next sections, we will delve deeper into the concepts of wave height and period, exploring their implications for wave propagation, energy transfer, and wave breaking.

#### 3.2b Wave Height and Period Measurement Techniques

The measurement of wave height and period is a critical aspect of ocean wave research. It allows us to understand the characteristics of waves, their propagation, and their interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. There are several techniques available for measuring wave height and period, each with its own advantages and limitations.

#### Direct Measurement Techniques

Direct measurement techniques involve physically measuring the wave height and period. This can be done using a variety of instruments, including wave gauges, wave riders, and wave radar.

Wave gauges, such as the Acoustic Wave Rider (AWR) and the Electromagnetic Wave Rider (EMWR), are instruments that are deployed in the water column to directly measure wave height and period. The AWR, for instance, uses an acoustic signal to measure the vertical displacement of the water surface, while the EMWR uses electromagnetic signals.

Wave riders, on the other hand, are instruments that are placed on the surface of the water to measure wave height and period. They work by detecting the vertical displacement of the water surface as the wave passes.

Wave radar, also known as synthetic aperture radar (SAR), is a technique that uses radar signals to measure wave height and period. It works by analyzing the radar reflections from the water surface to determine the wave height and period.

#### Indirect Measurement Techniques

Indirect measurement techniques involve inferring wave height and period from other measurements. This can be done using spectral analysis, which involves analyzing the frequency content of a signal to determine the wave period.

Spectral analysis can be performed using various methods, including the least-squares spectral analysis (LSSA) and the Lomb/Scargle periodogram method. These methods allow us to estimate the wave period from a time series of wave height measurements.

Another indirect measurement technique is the use of wave models, which are mathematical models that simulate the propagation of waves in the ocean. These models can be used to estimate wave height and period based on the known characteristics of the wave source and the ocean conditions.

#### Wave Height and Period Measurement Challenges

Despite the availability of various measurement techniques, there are several challenges associated with measuring wave height and period. These include the difficulty of deploying instruments in harsh ocean conditions, the need for high-resolution data, and the complexity of wave propagation in the ocean.

Furthermore, the accuracy of wave height and period measurements is crucial for many applications, including the design of ships and offshore energy systems, the prediction of wave-induced loads, and the understanding of wave-wave interactions. Therefore, ongoing research is needed to improve the accuracy and reliability of wave height and period measurements.

#### 3.2c Wave Height and Period Prediction Models

Predicting wave height and period is a crucial aspect of ocean wave research. It allows us to forecast the behavior of waves, their interaction with ships and offshore energy systems, and their impact on the marine environment. There are several models available for predicting wave height and period, each with its own assumptions and limitations.

#### Spectral Models

Spectral models are mathematical models that describe the frequency content of a wave signal. They are based on the assumption that the wave signal can be represented as a sum of sinusoidal components, each with a specific frequency and amplitude. The wave height and period can be predicted from the spectral model by integrating the spectral density over the frequency range of interest.

The spectral model can be represented as:

$$
S(\omega) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sum_{n=1}^{N} A_n \cos(\omega t - \phi_n),
$$

where $S(\omega)$ is the spectral density, $A_n$ is the amplitude of the $n$th sinusoidal component, $\omega$ is the frequency, $t$ is time, and $\phi_n$ is the phase shift.

#### Wave Propagation Models

Wave propagation models are mathematical models that describe the propagation of waves in the ocean. They are based on the principles of fluid dynamics and take into account the effects of wind, current, and the ocean bottom on wave propagation.

The wave propagation model can be represented as:

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + c \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} \right)^2 + \frac{1}{f_0} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} \right) = 0,
$$

where $\eta$ is the wave height, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, $c$ is the wave speed, and $f_0$ is the Coriolis parameter.

#### Wave Height and Period Prediction Challenges

Despite the availability of various prediction models, there are several challenges associated with predicting wave height and period. These include the complexity of wave propagation in the ocean, the uncertainty in the input data, and the need for high-resolution predictions.

Furthermore, the accuracy of wave height and period predictions is crucial for many applications, including the design of ships and offshore energy systems, the prediction of wave-induced loads, and the understanding of wave-wave interactions. Therefore, ongoing research is needed to improve the accuracy and reliability of wave height and period predictions.




#### 3.2b Measurement of Wave Height and Period

The measurement of wave height and period is a critical aspect of oceanography and marine engineering. It allows us to understand the characteristics of ocean waves, their propagation, and their impact on ships and offshore energy systems.

#### Wave Height Measurement

The measurement of wave height is typically done using wave sensors, such as wave radar or wave buoys. These sensors can measure the wave height at different points in the ocean, providing a spatial distribution of wave heights. 

Wave radar, for instance, uses radar technology to measure the wave height. It emits a radar pulse towards the sea surface and measures the time it takes for the pulse to return. The time delay is then converted into a distance, which corresponds to the wave height.

Wave buoys, on the other hand, use a variety of sensors to measure the wave height. These sensors can include accelerometers, pressure sensors, and tilt sensors. The data from these sensors is then used to calculate the wave height.

#### Wave Period Measurement

The measurement of wave period is typically done using the same wave sensors used for wave height measurement. The wave period can be calculated from the wave height and wavelength, which can be measured directly or inferred from the wave height.

For instance, the wave period can be calculated from the wave height using the formula:

$$
T = \frac{\lambda}{c}
$$

where "T" is the wave period, "λ" is the wavelength, and "c" is the wave speed. The wavelength can be measured directly using wave sensors, or inferred from the wave height using the formula:

$$
\lambda = \frac{g}{f}
$$

where "g" is the acceleration due to gravity and "f" is the wave frequency, which can be calculated from the wave height.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of wave steepness and its importance in the study of ocean waves.

#### 3.2c Wave Height and Period in Regular Waves

In the context of regular waves, the wave height and period are fundamental parameters that describe the wave's energy, propagation, and potential for breaking. 

#### Wave Height in Regular Waves

In regular waves, the wave height is typically measured from the trough (lowest point) to the crest (highest point) of a single wave. This is known as the wave amplitude. The wave height can vary significantly from one wave to the next, and it is typically described by a probability distribution. 

The significant wave height ("H"<sub>s}</sub>), as mentioned earlier, is defined as the mean wave height of the highest third of the waves. It is a commonly used statistic in the study of ocean waves.

#### Wave Period in Regular Waves

The wave period in regular waves is the time it takes for a complete wave cycle to pass a fixed point. It is a measure of the wave's frequency and is inversely related to the wave's wavelength. The longer the period, the lower the frequency and the larger the wavelength.

The wave period can be calculated from the wave height and wavelength, as discussed in the previous section. It can also be calculated from the wave frequency, which is the inverse of the wave period.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of wave steepness and its importance in the study of ocean waves.

#### 3.2d Wave Height and Period in Irregular Waves

In contrast to regular waves, irregular waves are characterized by their unpredictability and variability. The wave height and period in irregular waves are typically described by statistical measures, as the wave height and period can vary significantly from one wave to the next.

#### Wave Height in Irregular Waves

In irregular waves, the wave height is typically described by a probability distribution. The most commonly used distribution is the Rayleigh distribution, which assumes that the wave heights are exponentially distributed. The Rayleigh distribution is given by the equation:

$$
P(H) = \frac{H}{H_s}e^{-H/H_s}
$$

where "P(H)" is the probability of a wave height "H", and "H_s" is the significant wave height.

The significant wave height in irregular waves is defined as the mean wave height of the highest third of the waves. It is a commonly used statistic in the study of ocean waves.

#### Wave Period in Irregular Waves

The wave period in irregular waves is typically described by a probability distribution. The most commonly used distribution is the exponential distribution, which assumes that the wave periods are exponentially distributed. The exponential distribution is given by the equation:

$$
P(T) = \frac{1}{\mu}e^{-T/\mu}
$$

where "P(T)" is the probability of a wave period "T", and "μ" is the mean wave period.

The mean wave period in irregular waves is defined as the average of all the wave periods. It is a commonly used statistic in the study of ocean waves.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of wave steepness and its importance in the study of ocean waves.




#### 3.2c Effects of Wave Height and Period on Wave Dynamics

The wave height and period are two fundamental parameters that describe the characteristics of a wave. They are interconnected and their relationship is crucial in understanding the dynamics of waves.

#### Wave Height and Period Relationship

The wave height and period are related through the wave speed, wavelength, and frequency. The wave speed is given by the formula:

$$
c = \sqrt{\frac{g\lambda}{2\pi}}
$$

where "c" is the wave speed, "g" is the acceleration due to gravity, "λ" is the wavelength, and "π" is the pi constant. The wavelength is related to the period by the formula:

$$
\lambda = cT
$$

where "T" is the period. The frequency is related to the period by the formula:

$$
f = \frac{1}{T}
$$

where "f" is the frequency.

#### Effects of Wave Height on Wave Dynamics

The wave height has a significant impact on the wave dynamics. A larger wave height indicates a higher energy level of the wave. This can lead to more significant wave effects, such as larger wave forces on structures and more pronounced wave set-up.

The wave height also affects the wave steepness, which is defined as the ratio of the wave height to the wavelength. A higher wave steepness indicates a steeper wave, which can lead to more complex wave phenomena, such as wave breaking and wave reflection.

#### Effects of Wave Period on Wave Dynamics

The wave period also plays a crucial role in wave dynamics. A longer period indicates a lower frequency, which can lead to less complex wave phenomena. However, a longer period can also result in larger wave forces on structures, due to the larger wave energy content.

The wave period also affects the wave speed and wavelength. A longer period results in a lower wave speed and a longer wavelength. This can lead to more significant wave effects, such as larger wave set-up and more pronounced wave reflection.

In conclusion, the wave height and period are two fundamental parameters that describe the characteristics of a wave. They are interconnected and their relationship is crucial in understanding the dynamics of waves. The wave height and period can have significant effects on wave dynamics, affecting wave forces, wave steepness, and wave phenomena.




#### 3.3a Definition of Wave Amplitude and Phase

The amplitude and phase of a wave are fundamental properties that describe the wave's shape and position in its cycle. 

#### Wave Amplitude

The amplitude of a wave is the maximum displacement of the wave from its mean or equilibrium position. It is a measure of the wave's strength or energy. The amplitude is directly related to the wave's energy. A larger amplitude indicates a higher energy level of the wave. 

The amplitude of a wave can be represented mathematically as:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2}h
$$

where "A" is the amplitude and "h" is the wave height.

#### Wave Phase

The phase of a wave is the position of the wave in its cycle. It is measured in radians and can range from 0 to 2π. The phase is used to describe the relative position of two waves. A phase difference of 0° or 2π indicates that the waves are in phase, meaning they have the same shape and position in their cycles. A phase difference of 180° indicates that the waves are out of phase, meaning they have opposite shapes and positions in their cycles.

The phase of a wave can be represented mathematically as:

$$
\phi = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
$$

where "x" and "y" are the horizontal and vertical components of the wave, respectively.

#### Wave Amplitude and Phase in Regular Waves

In regular waves, the amplitude and phase are constant across the wave. This means that all points on the wave have the same amplitude and phase. This is a characteristic of plane progressive regular waves, which are the focus of this chapter.

The amplitude and phase of regular waves can be represented mathematically as:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2}h
$$

and

$$
\phi = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
$$

where "A" is the amplitude, "h" is the wave height, "x" and "y" are the horizontal and vertical components of the wave, respectively, and "φ" is the phase.

In the next section, we will discuss the effects of wave amplitude and phase on wave dynamics.

#### 3.3b Wave Amplitude and Phase in Regular Waves

In the previous section, we introduced the concepts of wave amplitude and phase. Now, we will delve deeper into these concepts and explore how they manifest in regular waves. 

#### Wave Amplitude in Regular Waves

In regular waves, the amplitude remains constant across the wave. This is a characteristic of plane progressive regular waves, which are the focus of this chapter. The amplitude of a regular wave can be represented mathematically as:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2}h
$$

where "A" is the amplitude and "h" is the wave height. This equation shows that the amplitude is directly proportional to the wave height. A larger wave height indicates a larger amplitude, and thus a higher energy level of the wave.

#### Wave Phase in Regular Waves

The phase of a wave describes its position in its cycle. In regular waves, the phase is constant across the wave. This means that all points on the wave have the same phase. The phase of a regular wave can be represented mathematically as:

$$
\phi = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
$$

where "x" and "y" are the horizontal and vertical components of the wave, respectively. This equation shows that the phase is determined by the ratio of the vertical component to the horizontal component of the wave. A phase difference of 0° or 2π indicates that the waves are in phase, meaning they have the same shape and position in their cycles. A phase difference of 180° indicates that the waves are out of phase, meaning they have opposite shapes and positions in their cycles.

#### Wave Amplitude and Phase in Regular Waves

In regular waves, the amplitude and phase are constant across the wave. This means that all points on the wave have the same amplitude and phase. This is a characteristic of plane progressive regular waves, which are the focus of this chapter. The amplitude and phase of regular waves can be represented mathematically as:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2}h
$$

and

$$
\phi = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right)
$$

where "A" is the amplitude, "h" is the wave height, "x" and "y" are the horizontal and vertical components of the wave, respectively, and "φ" is the phase. These equations show that the amplitude and phase are determined by the wave height and the ratio of the vertical component to the horizontal component of the wave, respectively.

In the next section, we will explore how these properties of wave amplitude and phase affect the interaction of waves with ships and offshore energy systems.

#### 3.3c Effects of Wave Amplitude and Phase on Ship Motion

The motion of a ship in the ocean is significantly influenced by the wave amplitude and phase. The wave amplitude, as we have seen, is directly proportional to the wave height. A larger wave height indicates a larger amplitude, and thus a higher energy level of the wave. This energy level can cause significant motion in a ship, particularly if the ship is small or lightweight.

The phase of the wave, on the other hand, determines the timing of the wave's passage. A ship that is in phase with a wave will experience the full force of the wave, while a ship that is out of phase will experience a reduced force. This can have significant implications for the ship's stability and maneuverability.

The effects of wave amplitude and phase on ship motion can be modeled using the Taylor's series method. This method allows us to approximate the motion of a ship in a wave field by considering the first few terms of the series. The first term, known as the zero-order term, represents the mean motion of the ship. The second term, known as the first-order term, represents the wave-induced motion of the ship. The third term, known as the second-order term, represents the wave-induced motion of the ship due to the wave-induced motion of the ship.

The wave-induced motion of the ship, represented by the first-order term, is given by the equation:

$$
\eta = A \cos(\omega t - kx)
$$

where "A" is the wave amplitude, "ω" is the wave frequency, "t" is time, "k" is the wave number, and "x" is the horizontal distance from the ship. This equation shows that the wave-induced motion of the ship is a function of the wave amplitude, frequency, and number, as well as the ship's position.

The wave-induced motion of the ship due to the wave-induced motion of the ship, represented by the second-order term, is given by the equation:

$$
\eta_2 = \frac{1}{2}A^2 \cos(2\omega t - 2kx)
$$

This equation shows that the wave-induced motion of the ship due to the wave-induced motion of the ship is a function of the square of the wave amplitude, the double of the wave frequency, and the double of the wave number. This term represents the second-order wave-induced motion of the ship, which is typically smaller than the first-order wave-induced motion.

In the next section, we will explore how these effects of wave amplitude and phase on ship motion can be mitigated using various techniques, such as wave-induced motion compensation and wave-induced motion prediction.




#### 3.3b Measurement of Wave Amplitude and Phase

The measurement of wave amplitude and phase is a crucial aspect of oceanography and marine engineering. It allows us to understand the behavior of waves and their interaction with various structures and systems. In this section, we will discuss the methods used to measure wave amplitude and phase.

#### Wave Amplitude Measurement

The measurement of wave amplitude is typically done using wave gauges. These devices are designed to measure the vertical displacement of the water surface due to the passage of a wave. The wave height, and hence the wave amplitude, can then be calculated from the measured displacement.

Wave gauges can be of various types, including mechanical, electrical, and optical types. Mechanical wave gauges, such as the oscillating water column (OWC) wave gauge, use a pendulum to measure the vertical displacement of the water surface. Electrical wave gauges, such as the electromagnetic wave gauge, use an electromagnetic field to measure the displacement. Optical wave gauges, such as the laser wave gauge, use laser light to measure the displacement.

#### Wave Phase Measurement

The measurement of wave phase is typically done using phase meters. These devices are designed to measure the phase difference between two waves. The phase difference can then be used to determine the relative position of the waves.

Phase meters can be of various types, including optical, acoustic, and radar types. Optical phase meters, such as the interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT) phase meter, use light scattering to measure the phase difference. Acoustic phase meters, such as the acoustic phase meter, use sound waves to measure the phase difference. Radar phase meters, such as the radar phase meter, use radar waves to measure the phase difference.

#### Least-Squares Spectral Analysis (LSSA)

The Least-Squares Spectral Analysis (LSSA) is a method used to estimate the spectral power of a signal. It involves computing the least-squares spectrum by performing the least-squares approximation multiple times, each time for a different frequency.

The LSSA can be implemented in a few lines of MATLAB code. For each frequency in a desired set of frequencies, sine and cosine functions are evaluated at the times corresponding to the data samples. Dot products of the data vector with the sinusoid vectors are taken and appropriately normalized. A time shift is calculated for each frequency to orthogonalize the sine and cosine components before the dot product. Finally, a power is computed from those two amplitude components.

This method treats each sinusoidal component independently, even though they may not be orthogonal to data points. It is also possible to perform a full simultaneous or in-context least-squares fit by solving a matrix equation and partitioning the total data variance between the specified sinusoid frequencies. Such a matrix least-squares solution is natively available in MATLAB as the backslash operator.

In the next section, we will discuss the effects of wave amplitude and phase on wave dynamics.

#### 3.3c Wave Amplitude and Phase in Deep Water

In deep water, the wave amplitude and phase behavior can be significantly different from that in shallow water. This is due to the effects of water depth on wave propagation. In this section, we will discuss the wave amplitude and phase in deep water.

#### Wave Amplitude in Deep Water

In deep water, the wave amplitude can be significantly larger than in shallow water. This is due to the fact that in deep water, the wave can propagate without significant energy loss due to bottom friction. The wave amplitude in deep water can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
A = \frac{H}{2} \sqrt{\frac{gT}{2\pi}}
$$

where $A$ is the wave amplitude, $H$ is the water depth, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $T$ is the wave period.

#### Wave Phase in Deep Water

In deep water, the wave phase can also be significantly different from that in shallow water. This is due to the fact that in deep water, the wave can propagate without significant phase shift due to bottom friction. The wave phase in deep water can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
\phi = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \int_{0}^{L} \frac{H}{H + y} dy
$$

where $\phi$ is the wave phase, $\lambda$ is the wave length, $L$ is the wave length, and $y$ is the vertical coordinate (positive upwards).

#### Wave Amplitude and Phase in Deep Water

In deep water, the wave amplitude and phase can be significantly larger and different from that in shallow water. This is due to the effects of water depth on wave propagation. The wave amplitude and phase in deep water can be calculated using the equations discussed above.

In the next section, we will discuss the wave amplitude and phase in shallow water.




#### 3.3c Effects of Wave Amplitude and Phase on Wave Dynamics

The amplitude and phase of a wave play a crucial role in its dynamics. The amplitude of a wave is directly related to its energy, and the phase of a wave determines its position in space and time. In this section, we will discuss the effects of wave amplitude and phase on wave dynamics.

#### Wave Amplitude and Energy

The amplitude of a wave is directly proportional to its energy. This relationship is described by the equation:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2} \rho g A^2
$$

where $E$ is the energy, $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $A$ is the amplitude of the wave. This equation shows that the energy of a wave is proportional to the square of its amplitude. Therefore, a wave with a larger amplitude has more energy than a wave with a smaller amplitude.

The energy of a wave is also related to its power, which is the rate at which the wave transfers energy. The power of a wave is given by the equation:

$$
P = \frac{1}{2} \rho g A^2 \omega
$$

where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the wave. This equation shows that the power of a wave is proportional to the square of its amplitude and its angular frequency. Therefore, a wave with a larger amplitude or a higher angular frequency has more power.

#### Wave Phase and Position

The phase of a wave determines its position in space and time. The phase of a wave is defined as the angle between the wave and a reference line. The phase of a wave can be determined by measuring the time it takes for the wave to pass a fixed point.

The phase of a wave is also related to its velocity. The velocity of a wave is given by the equation:

$$
v = \omega / k
$$

where $k$ is the wave number. This equation shows that the velocity of a wave is inversely proportional to its wave number. Therefore, a wave with a larger wave number has a higher velocity.

#### Wave Amplitude and Phase in Plane Progressive Regular Waves

In plane progressive regular waves, the wave amplitude and phase are constant across the wavefront. This means that the wave amplitude and phase are not affected by the direction of propagation. However, the wave amplitude and phase can be affected by the wave steepness and the wave number.

The wave steepness, defined as the ratio of the wave amplitude to the wavelength, can affect the wave amplitude and phase. A larger wave steepness can result in a larger wave amplitude and a higher wave phase.

The wave number, defined as the number of waves per unit length, can also affect the wave amplitude and phase. A larger wave number can result in a higher wave amplitude and a faster wave phase.

In conclusion, the amplitude and phase of a wave play a crucial role in its dynamics. The amplitude of a wave is directly related to its energy, and the phase of a wave determines its position in space and time. In plane progressive regular waves, the wave amplitude and phase are constant across the wavefront, but they can be affected by the wave steepness and the wave number.




#### 3.4a Definition of Wave Velocity

Wave velocity is a fundamental concept in the study of waves. It is defined as the speed at which a wave propagates through a medium. In the context of ocean waves, the medium is the water, and the wave velocity is the speed at which the wave travels across the surface of the water.

The wave velocity is a crucial parameter in understanding the behavior of waves. It is directly related to the wave's frequency and wavelength, as shown by the equation:

$$
v = \frac{\omega}{k}
$$

where $v$ is the wave velocity, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $k$ is the wave number. This equation shows that the wave velocity is inversely proportional to the wave number. Therefore, a wave with a larger wave number has a higher velocity.

The wave velocity is also related to the wave's energy and power. As discussed in the previous section, the energy and power of a wave are proportional to the square of its amplitude and its angular frequency. Therefore, a wave with a larger amplitude or a higher angular frequency has more energy and power.

In the context of ocean waves, the wave velocity is particularly important due to the complex interaction between the waves and the ocean. The wave velocity can change depending on the depth of the water, the presence of currents, and the characteristics of the seafloor. Understanding the wave velocity is crucial for predicting the behavior of ocean waves and their impact on ships and offshore energy systems.

In the next section, we will discuss the different types of wave velocities and their significance in the study of ocean waves.

#### 3.4b Calculation of Wave Velocity

The calculation of wave velocity is a crucial step in understanding the behavior of waves. As we have seen, the wave velocity is directly related to the wave's frequency and wavelength. Therefore, by knowing the frequency and wavelength of a wave, we can calculate its velocity.

The frequency of a wave is given by the equation:

$$
\omega = 2\pi f
$$

where $\omega$ is the angular frequency, and $f$ is the frequency. The frequency of a wave is the number of complete oscillations it makes in one second.

The wavelength of a wave is given by the equation:

$$
\lambda = \frac{v}{\omega}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the wavelength, and $v$ is the wave velocity. The wavelength of a wave is the distance between successive peaks or troughs of the wave.

Substituting the equation for frequency into the equation for wavelength, we get:

$$
\lambda = \frac{v}{2\pi f}
$$

Solving this equation for $v$, we get the equation for wave velocity:

$$
v = \frac{\omega}{k}
$$

This equation shows that the wave velocity is inversely proportional to the wave number. Therefore, a wave with a larger wave number has a higher velocity.

In the context of ocean waves, the wave velocity can change depending on the depth of the water, the presence of currents, and the characteristics of the seafloor. Therefore, the calculation of wave velocity is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of the physical properties of the ocean.

In the next section, we will discuss the different types of wave velocities and their significance in the study of ocean waves.

#### 3.4c Wave Velocity in Different Media

The wave velocity is a fundamental concept in the study of waves. It is defined as the speed at which a wave propagates through a medium. In the context of ocean waves, the medium is the water. However, the wave velocity can vary significantly depending on the properties of the medium. In this section, we will discuss the wave velocity in different media, focusing on the effects of water depth and currents.

##### Water Depth

The wave velocity in water is influenced by the depth of the water. As the depth of the water increases, the wave velocity decreases. This is due to the fact that the wave energy is spread over a larger volume of water as the depth increases. This phenomenon is described by the equation:

$$
v = \frac{\omega}{k} \sqrt{\frac{g}{k}}
$$

where $v$ is the wave velocity, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, $k$ is the wave number, and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. This equation shows that the wave velocity is proportional to the square root of the wave number and the acceleration due to gravity. Therefore, a wave with a larger wave number or a larger acceleration due to gravity has a higher wave velocity.

##### Currents

Currents can also affect the wave velocity. If a wave is propagating in a direction that is not parallel to the current, the wave velocity can be altered. This is due to the fact that the wave energy can be transferred to the current, leading to a decrease in the wave velocity. The effect of currents on wave velocity is described by the equation:

$$
v = \frac{\omega}{k} \sqrt{\frac{g}{k} - \frac{g}{c}}
$$

where $c$ is the speed of the current. This equation shows that the wave velocity is proportional to the square root of the wave number and the acceleration due to gravity minus the acceleration due to the current. Therefore, a wave with a larger wave number or a larger acceleration due to gravity relative to the acceleration due to the current has a higher wave velocity.

In the next section, we will discuss the wave velocity in different types of waves, focusing on the effects of wave steepness and wave age.




#### 3.4b Calculation of Wave Velocity

The calculation of wave velocity is a crucial step in understanding the behavior of waves. As we have seen, the wave velocity is directly related to the wave's frequency and wavelength. Therefore, by knowing the frequency and wavelength of a wave, we can calculate its velocity.

The frequency of a wave is given by the equation:

$$
f = \frac{1}{T}
$$

where $f$ is the frequency, and $T$ is the period of the wave. The period is the time it takes for one complete wave to pass a given point.

The wavelength of a wave is given by the equation:

$$
\lambda = cT
$$

where $\lambda$ is the wavelength, and $c$ is the wave speed. The wave speed is the speed at which the wave propagates through the medium.

Substituting the equation for the period into the equation for the wavelength, we get:

$$
\lambda = \frac{c}{f}
$$

Rearranging this equation, we get the equation for the wave velocity:

$$
v = \frac{\lambda}{T} = \frac{c}{f}
$$

This equation shows that the wave velocity is inversely proportional to the frequency. Therefore, a wave with a higher frequency has a lower velocity, and a wave with a lower frequency has a higher velocity.

In the context of ocean waves, the wave velocity can be affected by various factors, including the depth of the water, the presence of currents, and the characteristics of the seafloor. For example, in deep water, the wave velocity is given by the equation:

$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{g\lambda}{2\pi}}
$$

where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. This equation shows that the wave velocity increases with the wavelength. Therefore, larger waves have higher velocities.

Next, we will discuss the methods for measuring wave energy density and flux in the ocean, including the use of wave riders and wave radar. We will also touch upon the challenges and limitations of these methods.

Finally, we will discuss the implications of wave energy density and flux for the design and operation of ships and offshore energy systems.

### Subsection: 4.1a Energy Conservation Equations for Waves

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of wave energy density and flux, and discussed their importance in the study of ocean waves. In this section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical description of these parameters, and explore the energy conservation equations for waves.

The energy conservation equation for waves is a fundamental principle that describes the balance of energy in a wave field. It is derived from the general equation of heat transfer, which can be written as:

$$
\rho {\partial k\over{\partial t}} = -\rho {\bf v}\cdot\nabla k - \rho {\bf v}\cdot\nabla h + \rho T{\bf v}\cdot \nabla s + \nabla\cdot(\sigma\cdot {\bf v}) - \sigma_{ij}{\partial v_{i}\over{\partial x_{j}}}
$$

where $\rho$ is the density, $k$ is the kinetic energy, $h$ is the enthalpy, $T$ is the temperature, $s$ is the entropy, $\sigma$ is the stress tensor, and $v_i$ and $v_j$ are the components of the velocity vector.

The energy conservation equation can be further simplified by considering the case where thermal conduction and viscous forces are absent. In this case, the equation for entropy production collapses to $Ds/Dt=0$, showing that ideal fluid flow is isentropic.

The energy conservation equation for waves can be written as:

$$
\rho {\partial \eta\over{\partial t}} = -\rho {\bf v}\cdot\nabla \eta + \rho T{\bf v}\cdot \nabla s + \nabla\cdot(\sigma\cdot {\bf v}) - \sigma_{ij}{\partial v_{i}\over{\partial x_{j}}}
$$

where $\eta$ is the wave amplitude, and $s$ is the wave entropy.

This equation describes the balance of energy in a wave field, and is a key tool in the study of wave energy density and flux. It allows us to predict the forces exerted by waves on ships and offshore energy systems, and to optimize the design of these systems for maximum efficiency and safety.

In the next section, we will discuss the methods for measuring wave energy density and flux in the ocean, and explore the challenges and limitations of these methods.




#### 4.1b Applications of Energy Conservation in Wave Dynamics

The principles of energy conservation are fundamental to the study of wave dynamics. They allow us to understand the behavior of waves in the ocean, and to predict the forces exerted by waves on ships and offshore energy systems. In this section, we will explore some of the key applications of energy conservation in wave dynamics.

#### 4.1b.1 Wave Energy Density and Flux

As we have seen in the previous sections, the concepts of wave energy density and flux are crucial in the study of wave dynamics. They allow us to quantify the energy content of a wave field, and to predict the rate at which energy is transported by the waves.

The energy density of a wave is given by the equation:

$$
E = \frac{1}{2}\rho g \eta^2
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $\eta$ is the wave amplitude.

The energy flux of a wave is given by the equation:

$$
F = \frac{1}{2}\rho g \eta^2 \omega
$$

where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the wave.

These equations allow us to calculate the energy density and flux at any point in a wave field, and to predict the forces exerted by the waves on a ship or an offshore energy system.

#### 4.1b.2 Wave Interaction with Ships and Offshore Energy Systems

The principles of energy conservation are also crucial in understanding the interaction between waves and ships or offshore energy systems. When a wave interacts with a ship or an offshore energy system, energy is transferred from the wave to the system. This energy transfer can be calculated using the principles of energy conservation.

For example, consider a ship moving through a wave field. The ship experiences a force due to the wave, which can be calculated using the equation:

$$
F = \frac{1}{2}\rho g \eta^2 \omega
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\eta$ is the wave amplitude, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the wave.

This force can be used to calculate the work done by the wave on the ship, which is equal to the change in the ship's kinetic energy. This allows us to predict the motion of the ship in the wave field.

Similarly, for offshore energy systems, the principles of energy conservation can be used to predict the forces exerted by the waves on the system, and to design the system for maximum efficiency and safety.

In conclusion, the principles of energy conservation are fundamental to the study of wave dynamics. They allow us to understand the behavior of waves in the ocean, and to predict the forces exerted by waves on ships and offshore energy systems.




#### 4.1c Energy Conservation in Wave Energy Systems

In the previous sections, we have discussed the principles of energy conservation and their applications in wave dynamics. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of energy conservation in wave energy systems.

#### 4.1c.1 Energy Conservation in Wave Energy Converters

Wave energy converters are devices that convert the kinetic energy of waves into electrical energy. These devices operate based on the principles of energy conservation. The energy input to the device is equal to the energy output, plus the energy lost due to friction and other losses.

The energy input to a wave energy converter can be calculated using the equation:

$$
E_{\text{in}} = \frac{1}{2}\rho g \eta^2 \omega
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\eta$ is the wave amplitude, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the wave.

The energy output from the device is typically in the form of electrical energy, which can be calculated using the equation:

$$
E_{\text{out}} = \frac{1}{2}I^2R
$$

where $I$ is the current and $R$ is the resistance.

The energy lost due to friction and other losses can be calculated using the equation:

$$
E_{\text{loss}} = \frac{1}{2}\rho g \eta^2 \omega - \frac{1}{2}I^2R
$$

#### 4.1c.2 Energy Conservation in Wave Energy Storage

Wave energy can also be stored for later use. This is typically done using a wave energy storage device, such as a wave energy accumulator. The energy stored in a wave energy storage device can be calculated using the equation:

$$
E_{\text{stored}} = \frac{1}{2}\rho g \eta^2 \omega
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\eta$ is the wave amplitude, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the wave.

The energy released from the storage device can be calculated using the same equation.

#### 4.1c.3 Energy Conservation in Wave Energy Transfer

Wave energy can also be transferred from one location to another. This is typically done using a wave energy transfer device, such as a wave energy transmitter. The energy transferred can be calculated using the equation:

$$
E_{\text{transferred}} = \frac{1}{2}\rho g \eta^2 \omega
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\eta$ is the wave amplitude, and $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the wave.

The energy lost during the transfer can be calculated using the same equation.

In conclusion, the principles of energy conservation are fundamental to the understanding and design of wave energy systems. By applying these principles, we can design efficient and effective wave energy systems that can harness the power of the ocean waves.




#### 4.2a Definition of Wave Energy Density

Wave energy density is a fundamental concept in the study of ocean waves. It is defined as the amount of energy per unit area of the ocean surface. This energy is distributed throughout the water column and is a result of the kinetic and potential energy of the water particles.

The mean wave energy density per unit horizontal area, often denoted as `E`, is the sum of the mean kinetic energy density `E_kin` and the mean potential energy density `E_pot`. These quantities can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
E = E_{\text{kin}} + E_{\text{pot}}
$$

The mean kinetic energy density `E_kin` is given by:

$$
E_{\text{kin}} = \overline{\int_{-h}^0 \tfrac12 \rho \left[ \left| \mathbf{U} + \mathbf{u}_x \right|^2 + u_z^2 \right]\, \mathrm{d}z} - \int_{-h}^0 \tfrac12 \rho \left| \mathbf{U} \right|^2\, \mathrm{d}z
$$

where `σ` is the intrinsic frequency, `h` is the water depth, `ρ` is the density of the fluid, `U` is the velocity of the fluid, `u` is the velocity of the wave, `x` is the horizontal direction, `z` is the vertical direction, and `| |` denotes the magnitude of a vector.

The mean potential energy density `E_pot` is given by:

$$
E_{\text{pot}} = \overline{\int_{-h}^{\eta} \rho gz\,\mathrm{d}z} - \int_{-h}^0 \rho gz\, \mathrm{d}z
$$

where `η` is the wave amplitude, `g` is the acceleration due to gravity, and `z` is the vertical direction.

In the case of surface tension effects not being negligible, the potential and kinetic energy densities are modified to include a contribution from surface tension. This is given by:

$$
E_{\text{pot}} = \overline{\int_{-h}^{\eta} \rho gz + \gamma \kappa\,\mathrm{d}z} - \int_{-h}^0 \rho gz + \gamma \kappa\, \mathrm{d}z
$$

where `γ` is the surface tension coefficient and `κ` is the curvature of the wave surface.

The wave energy density is a crucial concept in the study of ocean waves. It provides a measure of the energy content of the waves, which is essential for understanding wave propagation, wave interaction with structures, and wave energy conversion.

#### 4.2b Calculation of Wave Energy Density

The calculation of wave energy density involves the integration of the kinetic and potential energy densities over the water column. This is typically done numerically, using methods such as the Gauss-Seidel method or the Runge-Kutta method.

The Gauss-Seidel method is an iterative technique for solving a system of linear equations. In the context of wave energy density, it can be used to solve the equations for the kinetic and potential energy densities. The method involves iteratively updating the values of the energy densities until they converge to a solution.

The Runge-Kutta method, on the other hand, is a numerical integration technique that can be used to approximate the integrals in the equations for the kinetic and potential energy densities. This method involves evaluating the integrands at several points within the integration interval, and then using these evaluations to approximate the integral.

The calculation of wave energy density can be complex, especially in the presence of surface tension effects. In such cases, it may be necessary to include additional terms in the equations for the kinetic and potential energy densities, as shown in the previous section.

The calculation of wave energy density is a crucial step in the study of ocean waves. It provides a quantitative measure of the energy content of the waves, which is essential for understanding wave propagation, wave interaction with structures, and wave energy conversion.

#### 4.2c Wave Energy Density in Deep Water

In deep water, the wave energy density is primarily due to the potential energy of the wave. This is because the kinetic energy density is proportional to the square of the wave amplitude, which is typically small in deep water. The potential energy density, on the other hand, is proportional to the wave amplitude and the wave frequency, both of which are significant in deep water.

The wave energy density in deep water can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
E = E_{\text{pot}} = \overline{\int_{-h}^{\eta} \rho gz + \gamma \kappa\,\mathrm{d}z} - \int_{-h}^0 \rho gz + \gamma \kappa\, \mathrm{d}z
$$

where `η` is the wave amplitude, `h` is the water depth, `g` is the acceleration due to gravity, `ρ` is the density of the fluid, `U` is the velocity of the fluid, `u` is the velocity of the wave, `x` is the horizontal direction, `z` is the vertical direction, `| |` denotes the magnitude of a vector, `σ` is the intrinsic frequency, `γ` is the surface tension coefficient, and `κ` is the curvature of the wave surface.

The wave energy density in deep water is a crucial concept in the study of ocean waves. It provides a measure of the energy content of the waves, which is essential for understanding wave propagation, wave interaction with structures, and wave energy conversion.

In the next section, we will discuss the concept of wave energy flux, which is another important aspect of wave energy in the ocean.

#### 4.3a Definition of Wave Energy Flux

Wave energy flux is a fundamental concept in the study of ocean waves. It is defined as the rate at which wave energy is transported across a unit area normal to the direction of propagation. In other words, it is the energy density of the wave multiplied by the wave's group velocity.

The wave energy flux, `S`, can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
S = E \cdot C_g
$$

where `E` is the wave energy density and `C_g` is the group velocity of the wave. The group velocity is the velocity at which the wave's energy is transported, and it is typically larger than the phase velocity of the wave.

The wave energy flux is a crucial concept in the study of ocean waves. It provides a measure of the energy transported by the wave, which is essential for understanding wave propagation, wave interaction with structures, and wave energy conversion.

In the next sections, we will discuss the calculation of wave energy flux and its implications for wave energy systems.

#### 4.3b Calculation of Wave Energy Flux

The calculation of wave energy flux involves the determination of the wave energy density and the group velocity of the wave. The wave energy density, `E`, has been discussed in the previous sections. The group velocity, `C_g`, can be calculated using the dispersion relation of the wave.

The dispersion relation is a mathematical relationship between the wave's frequency and its wave number, which is a measure of the wave's spatial frequency. The group velocity is the derivative of the dispersion relation with respect to the wave number.

For deep water, the dispersion relation is given by:

$$
\omega = \sqrt{gk}
$$

where `ω` is the frequency of the wave, `k` is the wave number, and `g` is the acceleration due to gravity. The group velocity, `C_g`, is then given by:

$$
C_g = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{g}{k}}
$$

Substituting these expressions into the equation for wave energy flux, we obtain:

$$
S = E \cdot \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{g}{k}}
$$

This equation gives the wave energy flux in deep water. In the next section, we will discuss the calculation of wave energy flux in shallow water.

#### 4.3c Wave Energy Flux in Shallow Water

In shallow water, the wave energy flux is calculated differently due to the presence of the bottom boundary. The wave energy flux in shallow water, `S`, is given by:

$$
S = E \cdot C_g + \frac{1}{2} \rho g \eta \sqrt{g}
$$

where `E` is the wave energy density, `C_g` is the group velocity, `ρ` is the density of the fluid, `g` is the acceleration due to gravity, `η` is the wave amplitude, and `k` is the wave number. The first term on the right-hand side represents the energy flux due to the wave propagation, as in deep water. The second term represents the energy flux due to the wave reflection from the bottom boundary.

The wave energy flux in shallow water is a crucial concept in the study of ocean waves. It provides a measure of the energy transported by the wave, which is essential for understanding wave propagation, wave interaction with structures, and wave energy conversion.

In the next section, we will discuss the implications of wave energy flux for wave energy systems.

#### 4.3d Wave Energy Flux and Wave Power

Wave power is a measure of the rate at which wave energy is absorbed or produced. It is typically expressed in watts per square meter (W/m²). The wave power, `P`, can be calculated from the wave energy flux, `S`, using the equation:

$$
P = S \cdot C_g
$$

where `C_g` is the group velocity of the wave. This equation shows that the wave power is proportional to the product of the wave energy flux and the group velocity.

The wave power is a crucial concept in the study of ocean waves. It provides a measure of the rate at which wave energy is absorbed or produced, which is essential for understanding wave propagation, wave interaction with structures, and wave energy conversion.

In the next section, we will discuss the implications of wave power for wave energy systems.

One of the main methods for measuring wave energy flux in the deep ocean is the use of deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) buoy systems. These systems consist of a bottom pressure recorder (BPR) anchored to the bottom of the sea floor, a moored surface buoy, and a transmission link that sends data from the BPR to the surface buoy. The surface buoy then sends the data by radio to satellites, which transmit it to the system office.

The DART buoy systems provide real-time measurements of the wave energy flux at different depths in the ocean. These measurements are crucial for understanding the propagation of deep ocean waves and for studying the effects of these waves on offshore structures and energy systems.

Another method for measuring wave energy flux in the deep ocean is the use of wave energy spectrum. This method provides a frequency-dependent measure of the wave energy flux, which can be used to study the energy content of deep ocean waves at different frequencies. The wave energy spectrum is typically represented as a function of the wave number $k$ or the angular frequency $\omega$.

In addition to these methods, there are also numerical models that can be used to estimate the wave energy flux in the deep ocean. These models use mathematical equations to simulate the propagation of deep ocean waves, and they can provide valuable insights into the wave energy flux at different locations and at different times.

It's important to note that the measurement of wave energy flux in the deep ocean is a complex task that requires careful calibration and validation. The accuracy of these measurements can be affected by various factors, including the accuracy of the instruments, the quality of the data, and the assumptions made in the analysis.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these methods and discuss their principles, their applications, and their limitations. We will also discuss the challenges and the future directions in the field of wave energy flux measurement in the deep ocean.

## Chapter 5: Wave Interaction with Ships

### Introduction

The interaction of waves with ships is a critical aspect of ocean engineering. This chapter, "Wave Interaction with Ships," delves into the complex dynamics of this interaction, exploring the fundamental principles and mathematical models that govern it. 

Ships, as floating structures, are subject to the forces exerted by waves. These forces can be beneficial, propelling the ship forward, or detrimental, causing stress and strain that can lead to structural failure. Understanding the dynamics of wave interaction with ships is therefore crucial for the design and operation of ships, as well as for the safety of those on board.

In this chapter, we will explore the mathematical models that describe wave interaction with ships. These models, expressed in terms of wave height, wavelength, and ship dimensions, provide a quantitative understanding of the forces exerted by waves on ships. We will also discuss the practical implications of these models, demonstrating how they can be used to predict wave forces on ships and to design ships that can withstand these forces.

We will also delve into the effects of wave interaction on ship motion, including heave, pitch, and roll. These effects can be significant, particularly in extreme weather conditions, and understanding them is crucial for the design of ships that can maintain stability and control in these conditions.

Finally, we will discuss the role of wave interaction in ship design and operation, highlighting the importance of considering wave interaction in the design of ships and in the planning of ship operations.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of wave interaction with ships, combining theoretical discussion with practical examples and case studies. It is designed to be accessible to both students and professionals in the field of ocean engineering, and to provide the knowledge and tools needed to understand and predict wave interaction with ships.




#### 4.2c Wave Energy Density in Deep Ocean

The deep ocean, defined as the ocean floor deeper than 200 meters, is a vast and complex environment where waves play a crucial role. The wave energy density in the deep ocean is a key parameter in understanding the dynamics of the ocean and its impact on marine structures and ecosystems.

The measurement of wave energy density in the deep ocean is a challenging task due to the harsh conditions and the lack of direct access. However, several methods and technologies have been developed to estimate the wave energy density in this environment.

One of the most common methods is the use of wave energy spectrum, which provides a frequency-dependent measure of the wave energy density. This method is particularly useful for studying the energy content of ocean waves at different frequencies. However, the application of this method in the deep ocean is limited due to the difficulty in obtaining accurate spectral measurements in this environment.

Another method is the use of wave energy density meters, which are instruments that measure the wave energy density directly. These meters can be deployed on the ocean floor or on underwater structures, and they provide real-time measurements of the wave energy density. However, the deployment of these instruments in the deep ocean is challenging and expensive.

In addition to these methods, there are also numerical models that can be used to estimate the wave energy density in the deep ocean. These models use mathematical equations to simulate the propagation of ocean waves, and they can provide valuable insights into the wave energy density at different locations and at different times. However, the accuracy of these models is highly dependent on the quality of the input data and the accuracy of the mathematical representations of the physical processes involved.

The wave energy density in the deep ocean is a key parameter in understanding the dynamics of the ocean and its impact on marine structures and ecosystems. However, further research is needed to improve our understanding and ability to measure and model the wave energy density in this environment.




#### 4.3a Definition of Wave Energy Flux

Wave energy flux is a fundamental concept in the study of ocean waves. It is defined as the rate at which wave energy is transported across a unit area normal to the direction of propagation. This concept is crucial in understanding the dynamics of ocean waves and their impact on marine structures and ecosystems.

The wave energy flux, denoted as $E_f$, is given by the product of the wave energy density $E_w$ and the wave propagation speed $c$:

$$
E_f = E_w \cdot c
$$

The wave energy density $E_w$ is a measure of the energy content of the wave at a given point in the ocean. It is typically measured in units of joules per meter cubed (J/m^3). The wave propagation speed $c$ is the speed at which the wave energy is transported through the ocean. It is typically measured in units of meters per second (m/s).

The wave energy flux is a vector quantity, with the direction of the vector indicating the direction of energy transport and the magnitude of the vector indicating the rate of energy transport. The direction of the wave energy flux is typically taken to be the direction of the wave propagation, which is the direction of the wave's motion.

The wave energy flux is a key parameter in understanding the dynamics of the ocean and its impact on marine structures and ecosystems. It is used in a variety of applications, including the design of offshore structures, the prediction of wave-induced loads on these structures, and the study of wave-wave interactions in the deep ocean.

In the next sections, we will delve deeper into the concept of wave energy flux, exploring its properties, its measurement, and its applications in the study of ocean waves.

#### 4.3b Calculation of Wave Energy Flux

The calculation of wave energy flux involves the determination of the wave energy density and the wave propagation speed. The wave energy density $E_w$ can be calculated using the wave energy spectrum, which provides a frequency-dependent measure of the wave energy density. The wave propagation speed $c$ can be determined using the dispersion relation, which relates the wave frequency to the wave number and the water depth.

The wave energy spectrum $S(f)$ is defined as the spectral density of the wave energy, where $f$ is the frequency of the wave. The wave energy spectrum is typically estimated from the Fourier transform of the wave time series. The wave energy density $E_w$ can then be calculated as:

$$
E_w = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} S(f) df
$$

The dispersion relation for deep water is given by:

$$
\omega = \sqrt{gk}
$$

where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the wave, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $k$ is the wave number. The wave propagation speed $c$ can then be calculated as:

$$
c = \frac{\omega}{k} = \sqrt{\frac{g}{k}}
$$

Substituting the expressions for $E_w$ and $c$ into the definition of wave energy flux, we obtain:

$$
E_f = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} S(f) \sqrt{gk} df
$$

This equation provides a method for calculating the wave energy flux. However, it should be noted that the wave energy spectrum and the dispersion relation are idealized models, and the actual wave energy flux in the ocean may deviate from these models due to various factors, including the presence of waves of different frequencies, the effects of wave-wave interactions, and the influence of the ocean bottom and the atmosphere. Therefore, the calculation of wave energy flux in the ocean is a complex task that requires careful consideration of these factors.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the methods and technologies that are used to measure wave energy flux in the ocean.

#### 4.3c Wave Energy Flux in Deep Ocean

The calculation of wave energy flux in the deep ocean is a complex task due to the unique characteristics of the deep ocean environment. The deep ocean is characterized by large water depths, low temperatures, high pressure, and sparse population. These conditions significantly influence the wave energy flux in the deep ocean.

The wave energy flux in the deep ocean can be calculated using the same approach as in shallow water, with some modifications to account for the effects of deep water. The wave energy spectrum $S(f)$ and the dispersion relation $\omega = \sqrt{gk}$ are still applicable, but the wave propagation speed $c$ is now given by:

$$
c = \frac{\omega}{k} = \sqrt{\frac{g}{k}}
$$

However, the wave energy spectrum and the dispersion relation are idealized models, and the actual wave energy flux in the deep ocean may deviate from these models due to various factors, including the effects of deep water.

One of the key factors that influence the wave energy flux in the deep ocean is the water depth. As the water depth increases, the wave energy flux decreases due to the increased path length that the wave energy must travel. This effect is particularly pronounced for deep ocean waves, where the wave energy flux can be significantly lower than in shallow water.

Another important factor is the wave frequency. In the deep ocean, the wave frequency is typically lower than in shallow water due to the increased water depth. This results in a lower wave energy flux, as the wave energy density is proportional to the square of the wave frequency.

The wave energy flux in the deep ocean is also influenced by the wave direction. In the deep ocean, the wave direction can be significantly different from the wave direction in shallow water due to the effects of deep water. This can result in a change in the wave energy flux, as the wave energy flux is proportional to the wave direction.

In addition to these factors, the wave energy flux in the deep ocean is also influenced by the wave-wave interactions, the effects of the ocean bottom and the atmosphere, and the presence of waves of different frequencies. Therefore, the calculation of wave energy flux in the deep ocean is a complex task that requires careful consideration of these factors.

In the next section, we will discuss some of the methods and technologies that are used to measure wave energy flux in the deep ocean.

## Chapter: Wave Energy Conversion

### Introduction

The ocean is a vast source of energy, and harnessing this energy has been a topic of interest for many years. One of the most promising ways to harness this energy is through wave energy conversion. This chapter, "Wave Energy Conversion," will delve into the intricacies of this process, exploring the principles behind it, the technologies used, and the potential applications of wave energy conversion in the field of ocean engineering.

Wave energy conversion is the process of converting the kinetic energy of ocean waves into other forms of energy, such as electricity. This energy can then be used to power various devices and systems, from small-scale applications like buoys and lighthouses, to large-scale applications like offshore wind farms. The potential for wave energy conversion is vast, and it is a field that is constantly evolving as engineers and scientists work to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of wave energy conversion technologies.

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental principles behind wave energy conversion, including the physics of wave propagation and the mathematical models used to describe wave energy. We will also delve into the various technologies used in wave energy conversion, from simple mechanical devices to complex electrical systems. We will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these technologies, and how they are used in different applications.

Finally, we will explore the potential applications of wave energy conversion in the field of ocean engineering. This includes the use of wave energy conversion in offshore structures, such as oil rigs and wind farms, as well as the potential for wave energy conversion to power autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and other marine equipment.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of wave energy conversion, its principles, technologies, and applications.

#### 4.3b Measurement of Wave Energy Flux

The measurement of wave energy flux is a complex task that requires sophisticated instrumentation and data processing techniques. The most common method for measuring wave energy flux is through the use of wave radar, a technology that utilizes radar waves to measure the height and direction of waves on the ocean surface.

Wave radar operates in the vertical mode at GHz frequencies, making it less affected by fog and water spray compared to laser rangefinders. The radar waveform used is typically a continuous wave frequency modulated (CWFM) or pulsed radar waveform, which provides range resolution. The beam diverges as it propagates, resulting in a larger footprint with increasing range. However, the area of the footprint increases proportionally to the square of the range.

One example of a wave radar used for wave energy flux measurement is the Miros SM-094, which is designed to measure waves and water level, including tides. This sensor is used as an air gap (bridge clearance) sensor in NOAA's PORTS system. Another example is the WaveRadar REX, a derivative of a Rosemount tank radar.

The measurement of wave energy flux involves collecting data on the elevation of the surface of the water at three or more locations. This data is then used to compute a directional spectrum of wave height, which is similar to the algorithm used to generate a directional spectrum from data on heave (vertical motion), pitch, and roll at a single location, as provided by a disc-shaped wave buoy. An array of three vertical radars, having footprints at the vertices of a horizontal, equilateral triangle, can provide the necessary data on water surface elevation.

The directional wave energy flux can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
E_f = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} E_w(\theta) \cdot c(\theta) \cdot P(\theta) \cdot d\theta
$$

where $E_w(\theta)$ is the wave energy density as a function of direction, $c(\theta)$ is the wave propagation speed as a function of direction, $P(\theta)$ is the wave power as a function of direction, and $d\theta$ is the differential in direction.

In the next section, we will discuss the applications of wave energy flux measurement in the study of ocean waves and their impact on marine structures and ecosystems.

#### 4.3c Wave Energy Flux in Deep Water

In deep water, the wave energy flux is primarily influenced by the wave energy density and the wave propagation speed. The wave energy density is a function of the wave height and the wave propagation speed is determined by the water depth and the wave frequency. 

The wave energy density in deep water can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
E_w = \frac{1}{2} \rho g H^2
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the water, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $H$ is the wave height.

The wave propagation speed in deep water is given by the equation:

$$
c = \sqrt{\frac{g \cdot \lambda}{2 \cdot \pi}}
$$

where $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the wave.

Substituting these equations into the wave energy flux equation, we get:

$$
E_f = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \frac{1}{2} \rho g H^2 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{g \cdot \lambda}{2 \cdot \pi}} \cdot P(\theta) \cdot d\theta
$$

This equation shows that the wave energy flux in deep water is primarily determined by the wave height, the wavelength, and the power distribution as a function of direction. 

In deep water, the wave energy flux is typically higher than in shallow water due to the longer wavelengths and higher wave propagation speeds. However, the wave energy flux can also be influenced by other factors such as the presence of currents and the topography of the ocean floor.

The measurement of wave energy flux in deep water is a challenging task due to the large area covered by the wave radar footprint. However, advancements in technology and data processing techniques have made it possible to accurately measure the wave energy flux in deep water.

In the next section, we will discuss the impact of wave energy flux on offshore energy systems and marine structures.




#### 4.3c Effects of Wave Energy Flux on Wave Dynamics

The wave energy flux plays a crucial role in the dynamics of ocean waves. It is the rate at which wave energy is transported across a given area, and it is a key factor in determining the strength and direction of wave propagation. In this section, we will explore the effects of wave energy flux on wave dynamics, focusing on the role of wave energy flux in wave propagation and the impact of wave energy flux on wave breaking.

#### 4.3c.1 Wave Propagation

Wave propagation is the movement of waves through a medium, in this case, the ocean. The wave energy flux is a key factor in determining the direction and strength of wave propagation. As mentioned in the previous section, the wave energy flux can be calculated using the equation:

$$
E_f = \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} E_w(\theta) \cdot c(\theta) \cdot P(\theta) \cdot d\theta
$$

where $E_w(\theta)$ is the wave energy density as a function of direction, $c(\theta)$ is the wave propagation speed, and $P(\theta)$ is the wave propagation direction. The wave energy flux is directly proportional to the product of the wave energy density and the wave propagation speed. This means that an increase in wave energy density or wave propagation speed will result in an increase in wave energy flux.

The wave energy flux also plays a crucial role in determining the direction of wave propagation. As the wave energy flux is proportional to the product of the wave energy density and the wave propagation direction, an increase in the wave energy density in a particular direction will result in an increase in the wave energy flux in that direction. This can lead to a strengthening of the wave propagation in that direction, potentially leading to the formation of wave fronts and the propagation of waves across large distances.

#### 4.3c.2 Wave Breaking

Wave breaking is a phenomenon that occurs when the wave energy density exceeds a certain threshold. This threshold is typically associated with the wave steepness, which is the ratio of the wave height to the wave length. When the wave steepness exceeds a certain value, the wave can break, leading to the transfer of wave energy from the wave to the surrounding water.

The wave energy flux plays a crucial role in wave breaking. As the wave energy flux is directly proportional to the wave energy density, an increase in the wave energy density can lead to an increase in the likelihood of wave breaking. This is because a higher wave energy density means that more wave energy is available to be transferred to the surrounding water when the wave breaks.

In conclusion, the wave energy flux plays a crucial role in the dynamics of ocean waves. It is a key factor in determining the direction and strength of wave propagation, and it also plays a crucial role in wave breaking. Understanding the effects of wave energy flux on wave dynamics is crucial for predicting and managing the impact of waves on ships and offshore energy systems.

## Chapter 5: Wave Energy Dissipation:




### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the concept of wave momentum flux, a crucial aspect of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. Wave momentum flux is a fundamental concept in the study of wave dynamics, and it plays a significant role in understanding the behavior of waves in the ocean. It is a measure of the transfer of momentum between the water and the atmosphere, and it is a key factor in determining the strength and direction of ocean currents.

The study of wave momentum flux is essential for several reasons. Firstly, it provides insights into the dynamics of ocean waves, which is crucial for understanding the behavior of ships and offshore energy systems. Secondly, it helps in predicting the impact of waves on these systems, which is vital for their design and operation. Lastly, it contributes to our understanding of the larger ocean-atmosphere system, which is essential for climate studies and weather forecasting.

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental principles of wave momentum flux, including its definition, calculation, and significance. We will also discuss the various factors that influence wave momentum flux, such as wave height, wave direction, and water depth. Furthermore, we will examine the role of wave momentum flux in the generation of ocean currents and its implications for ship navigation and offshore energy systems.

This knowledge will serve as a foundation for the subsequent chapters, where we will delve deeper into the specific applications of wave momentum flux in these areas.




### Section: 5.1 Momentum Conservation for Waves:

#### 5.1a Momentum Conservation Equations for Waves

The principle of momentum conservation is a fundamental concept in physics that states that the total momentum of a closed system remains constant unless acted upon by an external force. This principle is also applicable to waves, and it forms the basis of the Cauchy momentum equation.

The Cauchy momentum equation can be expressed as:

$$
\vec p(t+\Delta t) - \vec p(t) = \Delta t \vec\bar F
$$

where $\vec p(t)$ is the momentum in time `t`, and $\vec\bar F$ is the force averaged over $\Delta t$. Dividing by $\Delta t$ and passing to the limit $\Delta t \to 0$, we get the derivative:

$$
\frac{d\vec p}{dt} = \vec F
$$

Let us analyze each side of the equation.

#### Right side

The right side of the equation represents the total force acting on the system. This force can be split into body forces $\vec F_m$ and surface forces $\vec F_p$. The surface forces act on the walls of the cubic fluid element. For each wall, the "X" component of these forces was marked in the figure with a cubic element (in the form of a product of stress and surface area e.g. $-\sigma_{xx} \, dy \, dz$ with units $\mathrm{Pa\cdot m\cdot m = \frac{N}{m^2} \cdot m^2 = N}$).

Adding forces (their "X" components) acting on each of the cube walls, we get:

$$
F_p^x =
\left(\sigma_{xx}+\frac{\partial\sigma_{xx}}{\partial x}dx\right)dy\,dz
-\sigma_{xx}dy\,dz
+\left(\sigma_{yx}+\frac{\partial\sigma_{yx}}{\partial y}dy\right)dx\,dz
-\sigma_{yx}dx\,dz
+\left(\sigma_{zx}+\frac{\partial\sigma_{zx}}{\partial z}dz\right)dx\,dy
-\sigma_{zx}dx\,dy
$$

After ordering $F_p^x$ and performing similar reasoning for components $F_p^y, F_p^z$, we get:

$$
\vec F_p = \nabla \cdot \vec\sigma
$$

where $\vec\sigma$ is the stress tensor.

#### Left side

The left side of the equation represents the change in momentum over time. This can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{d\vec p}{dt} = \frac{\partial \vec p}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\vec p \vec v)
$$

where $\vec v$ is the velocity vector.

By equating the right and left sides of the equation, we obtain the momentum conservation equation for waves:

$$
\frac{\partial \vec p}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\vec p \vec v) = \nabla \cdot \vec\sigma
$$

This equation is a powerful tool for studying wave momentum flux, as it allows us to analyze the forces acting on a wave system and how they affect the system's momentum. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the implications of this equation and its applications in the study of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems.

#### 5.1b Wave Momentum Flux and Energy Transfer

The concept of wave momentum flux is closely related to the concept of energy transfer. As we have seen in the previous section, the momentum conservation equation for waves can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{\partial \vec p}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\vec p \vec v) = \nabla \cdot \vec\sigma
$$

This equation can also be interpreted in terms of energy transfer. The left side of the equation represents the rate of change of momentum, which is equivalent to the rate of change of energy. The right side of the equation represents the divergence of the stress tensor, which is equivalent to the force per unit area.

The stress tensor $\vec\sigma$ can be decomposed into two parts: the first part represents the normal stress, which is the dot product of the stress tensor and the normal vector; and the second part represents the shear stress, which is the cross product of the stress tensor and the normal vector. The normal stress is equivalent to the force per unit area in the direction of the normal vector, while the shear stress is equivalent to the force per unit area in the direction perpendicular to the normal vector.

Therefore, the momentum conservation equation for waves can be rewritten as:

$$
\frac{\partial \vec p}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\vec p \vec v) = \nabla \cdot (\vec\sigma_n + \vec\sigma_s)
$$

where $\vec\sigma_n$ is the normal stress tensor and $\vec\sigma_s$ is the shear stress tensor.

This equation shows that the rate of change of momentum is equal to the divergence of the normal and shear stress tensors. This means that the rate of change of momentum is equal to the rate of energy transfer. In other words, the momentum flux is equivalent to the energy flux.

This relationship between wave momentum flux and energy transfer is crucial in understanding the behavior of waves in the ocean. It allows us to analyze the forces acting on a wave system and how they affect the system's energy. This is particularly important in the study of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems, where the transfer of energy between waves and these systems plays a crucial role.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of wave momentum flux and its applications in the study of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems.

#### 5.1c Wave Momentum Flux and Wave Propagation

The concept of wave momentum flux is not only crucial in understanding the energy transfer between waves and other systems, but it also plays a significant role in the propagation of waves. The momentum conservation equation for waves, as we have seen, can be rewritten as:

$$
\frac{\partial \vec p}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\vec p \vec v) = \nabla \cdot (\vec\sigma_n + \vec\sigma_s)
$$

This equation can be used to analyze the propagation of waves in the ocean. The left side of the equation represents the rate of change of momentum, which is equivalent to the rate of change of energy. The right side of the equation represents the divergence of the stress tensor, which is equivalent to the force per unit area.

The stress tensor $\vec\sigma$ can be decomposed into two parts: the normal stress, which is the dot product of the stress tensor and the normal vector, and the shear stress, which is the cross product of the stress tensor and the normal vector. The normal stress is equivalent to the force per unit area in the direction of the normal vector, while the shear stress is equivalent to the force per unit area in the direction perpendicular to the normal vector.

Therefore, the momentum conservation equation for waves can be rewritten as:

$$
\frac{\partial \vec p}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\vec p \vec v) = \nabla \cdot (\vec\sigma_n + \vec\sigma_s)
$$

where $\vec\sigma_n$ is the normal stress tensor and $\vec\sigma_s$ is the shear stress tensor.

This equation shows that the rate of change of momentum is equal to the divergence of the normal and shear stress tensors. This means that the rate of change of momentum is equal to the rate of energy transfer. In other words, the momentum flux is equivalent to the energy flux.

This relationship between wave momentum flux and energy transfer is crucial in understanding the propagation of waves in the ocean. It allows us to analyze the forces acting on a wave system and how they affect the system's energy. This is particularly important in the study of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems, where the transfer of energy between waves and these systems plays a crucial role.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of wave momentum flux and its applications in the study of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems.

The Cauchy momentum equation can be expressed as:

$$
\vec p(t+\Delta t) - \vec p(t) = \Delta t \vec\bar F
$$

where $\vec p(t)$ is the momentum in time `t`, and $\vec\bar F$ is the force averaged over $\Delta t$. Dividing by $\Delta t$ and passing to the limit $\Delta t \to 0$, we get the derivative:

$$
\frac{d\vec p}{dt} = \vec F
$$

Let us analyze each side of the equation.

#### Right side

The right side of the equation represents the total force acting on the system. This force can be split into body forces $\vec F_m$ and surface forces $\vec F_p$. The surface forces act on the walls of the cubic fluid element. For each wall, the "X" component of these forces was marked in the figure with a cubic element (in the form of a product of stress and surface area e.g. $-\sigma_{xx} \, dy \, dz$ with units $\mathrm{Pa\cdot m\cdot m = \frac{N}{m^2} \cdot m^2 = N}$).

Adding forces (their "X" components) acting on each of the cube walls, we get:

$$
F_p^x =
\left(\sigma_{xx}+\frac{\partial\sigma_{xx}}{\partial x}dx\right)dy\,dz
-\sigma_{xx}dy\,dz
+\left(\sigma_{yx}+\frac{\partial\sigma_{yx}}{\partial y}dy\right)dx\,dz
-\sigma_{yx}dx\,dz
+\left(\sigma_{zx}+\frac{\partial\sigma_{zx}}{\partial z}dz\right)dx\,dy
-\sigma_{zx}dx\,dy
$$

After ordering $F_p^x$ and performing similar reasoning for components $F_p^y, F_p^z$, we get:

$$
\vec F_p = \nabla \cdot \vec\sigma
$$

where $\vec\sigma$ is the stress tensor.

#### Left side

The left side of the equation represents the change in momentum over time. This can be expressed as:

$$
\frac{d\vec p}{dt} = \frac{\partial \vec p}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\vec p \vec v)
$$

where $\vec v$ is the velocity vector. The first term represents the change in momentum due to a change in time, while the second term represents the change in momentum due to a change in velocity.

Substituting the expressions for the right and left sides of the equation, we get:

$$
\nabla \cdot \vec\sigma = \frac{\partial \vec p}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\vec p \vec v)
$$

This equation is known as the Cauchy momentum equation, and it represents the conservation of momentum for waves. It states that the change in momentum of a system is equal to the sum of the forces acting on the system. This equation is fundamental in the study of wave dynamics and is used to derive many important wave equations, including the wave momentum flux equation.

#### 5.1b Applications of Momentum Conservation in Wave Dynamics

The principle of momentum conservation is a powerful tool in the study of wave dynamics. It allows us to derive important equations that describe the behavior of waves, such as the wave momentum flux equation. This equation is particularly useful in understanding the interaction of waves with ships and offshore energy systems.

The wave momentum flux equation can be derived from the Cauchy momentum equation by considering the forces acting on a small volume of fluid. This equation describes the flux of momentum in a wave, and it is given by:

$$
\vec F = \rho \frac{\partial \vec v}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \vec v \vec v)
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $\vec v$ is the velocity vector, and $\vec F$ is the force vector. This equation is used to describe the momentum transfer between waves and ships or offshore energy systems.

In the context of ship dynamics, the wave momentum flux equation can be used to understand the forces acting on a ship due to waves. This is particularly important in the design of ships, as it allows engineers to predict the behavior of a ship in waves and design ships that can withstand these forces.

In the context of offshore energy systems, the wave momentum flux equation is used to understand the forces acting on these systems due to waves. This is crucial in the design and operation of these systems, as it allows engineers to predict the behavior of these systems in waves and design systems that can withstand these forces.

In conclusion, the principle of momentum conservation is a fundamental concept in the study of wave dynamics. It allows us to derive important equations, such as the wave momentum flux equation, which are crucial in understanding the interaction of waves with ships and offshore energy systems.

#### 5.1a Wave Momentum Conservation Equation

The conservation of momentum is a fundamental principle in physics that states that the total momentum of a closed system remains constant unless acted upon by an external force. This principle is also applicable to waves, and it is particularly important in the study of ocean waves and their interaction with ships and offshore energy systems.

The momentum conservation equation for waves can be derived from the Navier-Stokes equations, which describe the motion of fluid substances. In the case of waves, the fluid is the water in the ocean, and the motion is the propagation of the waves. The Navier-Stokes equations can be simplified under certain conditions, such as the assumption of incompressibility and the neglect of viscosity, to yield the wave momentum conservation equation.

The wave momentum conservation equation can be written as:

$$

$$

where $\vec{p}$ is the wave momentum and $\vec{F}$ is the wave force. The wave momentum is defined as the product of the wave amplitude and the wave vector, $\vec{p} = a \vec{k}$. The wave force is the product of the wave amplitude, the wave vector, and the wave frequency, $\vec{F} = a \omega \vec{k}$.

The wave momentum conservation equation states that the rate of change of wave momentum is equal to the negative divergence of the wave force. This equation is a statement of the conservation of momentum for waves, and it is a key tool in the study of wave-structure interaction.

In the next section, we will discuss the implications of the wave momentum conservation equation for the design and operation of ships and offshore energy systems.

$$
\frac{\partial \vec{p}}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot \vec{F} = \vec{F}_{bf}
$$

where $\vec{p}$ is the wave momentum, $\vec{F}$ is the wave force, and $\vec{F}_{bf}$ is the bottom friction force. The wave momentum is defined as the product of the wave amplitude and the wave vector, $\vec{p} = a \vec{k}$. The wave force is the product of the wave amplitude, the wave vector, and the wave frequency, $\vec{F} = a \omega \vec{k}$. The bottom friction force is a function of the wave amplitude, the wave vector, and the bottom friction coefficient, $\vec{F}_{bf} = c_f a \vec{k}$.

The wave momentum conservation equation in shallow water states that the rate of change of wave momentum is equal to the negative divergence of the wave force plus the bottom friction force. This equation is a statement of the conservation of momentum for waves in shallow water, and it is a key tool in the study of wave-structure interaction in shallow water.

#### 5.2a Definition of Wave Momentum Density

Wave momentum density is a fundamental concept in the study of ocean waves and their interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. It is defined as the amount of momentum per unit area of the wave. In other words, it is the wave momentum divided by the wave area. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:

$$
m = \frac{p}{A}
$$

where $m$ is the wave momentum density, $p$ is the wave momentum, and $A$ is the wave area.

The wave momentum density is a vector quantity, with both magnitude and direction. The direction of the wave momentum density vector is the same as the direction of the wave propagation. The magnitude of the wave momentum density vector is proportional to the wave amplitude and the wave frequency.

The wave momentum density is a crucial concept in the study of wave-structure interaction. It is the force per unit area exerted by the wave on the structure. This force can cause stress and strain in the structure, which can lead to fatigue and failure. Therefore, understanding the wave momentum density is essential for the design and operation of ships and offshore energy systems.

In the next section, we will discuss the calculation of the wave momentum density and its implications for wave-structure interaction.

#### 5.2b Calculation of Wave Momentum Density

The calculation of wave momentum density involves the integration of the wave momentum over the wave area. This can be done using the wave momentum conservation equation, which states that the rate of change of wave momentum is equal to the negative divergence of the wave force. 

The wave force is the product of the wave amplitude, the wave vector, and the wave frequency. The wave vector is the wave propagation direction multiplied by the wave number. The wave number is the inverse of the wavelength. The wave frequency is the inverse of the wave period. 

The wave momentum conservation equation can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot F = 0
$$

where $p$ is the wave momentum, $F$ is the wave force, and $\nabla \cdot$ denotes the divergence operator. 

The wave momentum density $m$ is then given by the integration of this equation over the wave area $A$:

$$
m = \int_A \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot F \, dA = \int_A \frac{\partial (p/A)}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (F/A) \, dA
$$

This equation shows that the wave momentum density is the rate of change of the wave momentum density plus the divergence of the wave force density. The wave force density is the wave force divided by the wave area. 

In the next section, we will discuss the implications of this equation for wave-structure interaction.

#### 5.2c Wave Momentum Density in Deep Water

In deep water, the wave momentum density is particularly important due to the absence of bottom friction and the assumption of linear wave theory. The wave momentum density in deep water can be calculated using the wave momentum conservation equation, which states that the rate of change of wave momentum is equal to the negative divergence of the wave force. 

The wave force in deep water is the product of the wave amplitude, the wave vector, and the wave frequency. The wave vector is the wave propagation direction multiplied by the wave number. The wave number is the inverse of the wavelength. The wave frequency is the inverse of the wave period. 

The wave momentum conservation equation in deep water can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot F = 0
$$

where $p$ is the wave momentum, $F$ is the wave force, and $\nabla \cdot$ denotes the divergence operator. 

The wave momentum density $m$ in deep water is then given by the integration of this equation over the wave area $A$:

$$
m = \int_A \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot F \, dA = \int_A \frac{\partial (p/A)}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (F/A) \, dA
$$

One such instrument is the Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART) buoy system. This system is designed to measure the wave momentum density in the deep ocean. It consists of a bottom pressure recorder (BPR) anchored to the bottom of the sea floor, a moored surface buoy connected to the BPR via an acoustic transmission link, and a surface buoy that sends the data by radio to satellites and then to the ground.

The BPR measures the temperature and pressure of the surrounding sea water. The surface buoy then converts this data into an average height of the waves surrounding the buoy.

#### 5.3a Definition of Wave Momentum Flux

The wave momentum flux is a fundamental concept in the study of ocean wave interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. It is defined as the rate of change of wave momentum per unit area. In other words, it is the force exerted by waves on a unit area of the water surface.

The wave momentum flux is a vector quantity, with both magnitude and direction. The direction of the wave momentum flux is parallel to the direction of wave propagation, and the magnitude is proportional to the square of the wave amplitude.

The wave momentum flux can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\mathbf{F} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{p}}{\partial A}
$$

where $\mathbf{F}$ is the wave momentum flux, $\mathbf{p}$ is the wave momentum, and $A$ is the area of the water surface.

The wave momentum flux is a crucial parameter in the design and operation of ships and offshore energy systems. It is a key factor in determining the forces exerted by waves on these systems, and thus affects their stability and safety.

In ships, the wave momentum flux is a critical parameter in the design of hulls and decks. The hull of a ship is designed to withstand the forces exerted by waves, and these forces are directly related to the wave momentum flux. The wave momentum flux also affects the design of decks, as it influences the forces exerted by waves on the deck structure.

#### 5.3b Calculation of Wave Momentum Flux

The calculation of wave momentum flux involves the application of the wave momentum conservation equation. This equation states that the rate of change of wave momentum is equal to the negative divergence of the wave force. The wave force is the product of the wave amplitude, the wave vector, and the wave frequency. The wave vector is the wave propagation direction multiplied by the wave number. The wave number is the inverse of the wavelength. The wave frequency is the inverse of the wave period.

The wave momentum conservation equation can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{p}}{\partial t} = -\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}
$$

where $\mathbf{p}$ is the wave momentum, $\mathbf{F}$ is the wave force, and $t$ is time.

The wave force $\mathbf{F}$ can be calculated using the wave amplitude $A$, the wave vector $k$, and the wave frequency $\omega$:

$$
\mathbf{F} = A^2 k \omega
$$

The wave vector $k$ is given by the wave propagation direction $n$ and the wave number $k$:

$$
k = n k
$$

The wave number $k$ is the inverse of the wavelength $\lambda$:

$$
k = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}
$$

The wave frequency $\omega$ is the inverse of the wave period $T$:

$$
\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}
$$

By substituting these expressions into the wave momentum conservation equation, we can obtain the wave momentum flux $\mathbf{F}$:

$$
\mathbf{F} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{p}}{\partial t} = -\nabla \cdot \left(A^2 k \omega\right)

#### 5.3b Measurement of Wave Momentum Flux

The measurement of wave momentum flux is a critical aspect of understanding and predicting the behavior of waves in the ocean. This section will discuss the various methods and technologies used to measure wave momentum flux.

##### QuikSCAT

One of the most widely used technologies for measuring wave momentum flux is the QuikSCAT (Quick Scatterometer). This active microwave radar system emits pulses of low-power microwave radiation and measures the power reflected back to its receiving antenna from the wind-roughened sea surface. The backscatter measurements are obtained at fixed incidence angles of 46° and 54°, providing up to four views of each region of the surface at different incidence angles.

The QuikSCAT system uses a dual-beam, conically scanning antenna that samples the full range of azimuth angles during each antenna revolution. This allows for a spatial resolution of about 25 km, with a higher resolution of 12.5 km achievable through special processing, and an even higher resolution of 5 km for limited regions and special cases.

The backscatter measurements are calibrated to the wind speed and direction of the wind at a reference height of 10 meters above the sea surface. This calibration allows for the estimation of wave momentum flux, which is a key parameter in the design and operation of ships and offshore energy systems.

##### Other Methods

While the QuikSCAT system is one of the most widely used technologies for measuring wave momentum flux, there are other methods and technologies available. These include the use of wave riders, which are small, buoyant devices that ride on the surface of the waves and measure their properties. Wave riders can provide detailed information about the wave field, including the wave momentum flux.

Another method is the use of wave radar, which uses radar technology to measure the properties of waves. Wave radar can provide information about the wave momentum flux, as well as other properties such as wave height and direction.

In addition to these technologies, there are also various numerical models and simulations that can be used to estimate wave momentum flux. These models and simulations use mathematical equations and computer algorithms to simulate the behavior of waves in the ocean, and can provide valuable insights into the wave momentum flux.

In conclusion, the measurement of wave momentum flux is a critical aspect of understanding and predicting the behavior of waves in the ocean. Various technologies and methods are available for this purpose, each with its own advantages and limitations. The choice of method depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the application.

The design of ships is a complex process that involves a multitude of factors, including the interaction of waves with the ship. The wave momentum flux, as discussed in the previous sections, plays a crucial role in this interaction. In this section, we will explore how the wave momentum flux is considered in the design of ships, particularly in the context of wave-induced motions and ship motions.

##### Wave-Induced Motions

Wave-induced motions are a significant factor in ship design. These motions, which include heave, pitch, and roll, are primarily caused by the interaction of waves with the ship. The wave momentum flux is a key parameter in predicting these motions.

The wave momentum flux can be used to calculate the wave-induced forces on the ship. These forces, in turn, can be used to determine the wave-induced motions of the ship. This is particularly important in the design of ships that operate in rough seas, where wave-induced motions can significantly affect the ship's stability and safety.

##### Ship Motions

Ship motions, including heave, pitch, and roll, are also influenced by the wave momentum flux. The wave momentum flux can be used to calculate the wave-induced forces on the ship, which can then be used to determine the ship's motions.

In the design of ships, it is crucial to ensure that the ship's motions are within acceptable limits. Excessive motions can lead to instability and safety issues, while insufficient motions can result in poor performance and efficiency. The wave momentum flux plays a key role in achieving this balance.

##### Wave-Induced Forces

The wave-induced forces on a ship are a function of the wave momentum flux. These forces can be calculated using the wave momentum conservation equation, which states that the rate of change of wave momentum is equal to the sum of the forces acting on the wave.

In the context of ship design, the wave-induced forces are particularly important. They can be used to determine the ship's motions, as well as the stresses and strains on the ship's structure. This information is crucial in the design and analysis of ships, and the wave momentum flux plays a key role in providing this information.

In conclusion, the wave momentum flux plays a crucial role in the design of ships.

#### 5.3c Effects of Wave Momentum Flux on Wave Dynamics

The wave momentum flux plays a crucial role in the dynamics of waves in the ocean. It is a key factor in the transfer of energy and momentum between the waves and the surrounding medium, which can significantly impact the behavior of the waves.

##### Wave Propagation

The wave momentum flux affects the propagation of waves in the ocean. The wave momentum flux is a measure of the force exerted by the waves on the surrounding medium. This force can either be restorative or dissipative, depending on the nature of the medium.

In a dissipative medium, such as water, the wave momentum flux is dissipative, meaning it tends to decrease the amplitude of the waves. This is due to the frictional forces between the waves and the water molecules, which cause the waves to lose energy and momentum. This dissipation of wave momentum flux can lead to the eventual dissipation of the waves, especially in deep water where the wave amplitude decreases exponentially with depth.

In a restorative medium, such as a fluid-filled elastic medium, the wave momentum flux is restorative, meaning it tends to increase the amplitude of the waves. This is due to the elastic forces in the medium, which can restore the waves to their original shape after they have been distorted by the waves. This restorative effect can lead to the amplification of the waves, especially in shallow water where the wave amplitude increases with depth.

##### Wave Interactions

The wave momentum flux also plays a crucial role in wave interactions. Wave interactions occur when two or more waves interact with each other, leading to the formation of new waves or the modification of the original waves. The wave momentum flux is a key factor in these interactions, as it determines the force exerted by the waves on each other.

For example, in the case of wave reflection, the wave momentum flux of the incident wave is reflected back into the medium as a reflected wave. The angle of reflection is determined by the law of reflection, which states that the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection. The wave momentum flux of the reflected wave is then transferred back into the medium, contributing to the overall wave momentum flux.

In the case of wave refraction, the wave momentum flux of the incident wave is transferred into the medium as a refracted wave. The angle of refraction is determined by Snell's law, which states that the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is equal to the inverse ratio of the refractive indices of the two media. The wave momentum flux of the refracted wave is then transferred into the medium, contributing to the overall wave momentum flux.

##### Wave Breaking

The wave momentum flux also plays a crucial role in wave breaking. Wave breaking occurs when the wave amplitude becomes too large, leading to the formation of turbulent water and the dissipation of the wave energy. The wave momentum flux is a key factor in this process, as it determines the force exerted by the waves on the surrounding medium.

In deep water, where the wave amplitude decreases exponentially with depth, wave breaking is less likely to occur. However, in shallow water, where the wave amplitude increases with depth, wave breaking can occur more easily. The wave momentum flux can play a crucial role in this process, as it can provide the necessary force to break the waves.

In conclusion, the wave momentum flux plays a crucial role in the dynamics of waves in the ocean. It affects the propagation of waves, wave interactions, and wave breaking, and is a key factor in the transfer of energy and momentum between the waves and the surrounding medium. Understanding the effects of wave momentum flux on wave dynamics is crucial for predicting the behavior of waves in the ocean.

### Section: 6.1 Wavemaker Types:

Wavemakers are essential tools in the study of ocean waves, allowing us to generate and control waves in a controlled environment. In this section, we will explore the different types of wavemakers and their respective advantages and limitations.

#### 6.1a Different Types of Wavemakers

There are several types of wavemakers, each with its own unique characteristics and applications. Some of the most commonly used types of wavemakers include the Taylor wavemaker, the Michell's theory wavemaker, and the Taylor-Michell wavemaker.

The Taylor wavemaker, also known as the Taylor's theory wavemaker, is a type of wavemaker that is commonly used in laboratory experiments to study wave propagation and interaction with different structures. It is based on the principles of Taylor's theory, which describes the motion of a fluid in a circular container. The Taylor wavemaker consists of a circular container filled with fluid, with a rotating paddle at the bottom. The paddle rotates at a constant speed, creating a circular motion of the fluid. This motion is then amplified by the container, resulting in the generation of waves. The Taylor wavemaker is particularly useful for studying the interaction of waves with circular structures, such as offshore oil platforms.

The Michell's theory wavemaker, also known as the Michell's theory wavemaker, is another commonly used type of wavemaker. It is based on the principles of Michell's theory, which describes the motion of a fluid in a rectangular container. The Michell's theory wavemaker consists of a rectangular container filled with fluid, with a reciprocating paddle at the bottom. The paddle moves back and forth at a constant speed, creating a linear motion of the fluid. This motion is then amplified by the container, resulting in the generation of waves. The Michell's theory wavemaker is particularly useful for studying the interaction of waves with rectangular structures, such as ships.

The Taylor-Michell wavemaker, also known as the Taylor-Michell's theory wavemaker, combines the principles of both Taylor's theory and Michell's theory. It is a more advanced type of wavemaker that is used for more complex studies of wave interaction with different structures. The Taylor-Michell wavemaker consists of a circular container filled with fluid, with a rotating paddle at the bottom and a reciprocating paddle at the top. The paddles move at a constant speed, creating a combination of circular and linear motions of the fluid. This results in the generation of more complex waves, making it a valuable tool for studying the interaction of waves with various structures.

Each type of wavemaker has its own advantages and limitations, and the choice of which one to use depends on the specific study or experiment being conducted. In the next section, we will explore the mathematical models used to describe wavemaker motion and the resulting wave patterns.

where $A$ is the wave amplitude and $U$ is the wavemaker velocity. The wavemaker strength is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes the efficiency of a wavemaker.

The wavemaker strength is related to the linear wavemaker equations through the dispersion relation. As the wavemaker strength increases, the wave speed $c$ decreases, leading to a decrease in the dispersion relation. This results in a decrease in the wave amplitude, which is proportional to the wave speed. Therefore, as the wavemaker strength increases, the wave amplitude decreases, leading to a decrease in the wavemaker efficiency.

In conclusion, the wavemaker strength plays a crucial role in the linear wavemaker equations and the propagation of waves in a fluid medium. It is a key parameter in the study of wave generation and propagation, and is particularly important in the design and analysis of ships and offshore energy systems.

#### 6.2b.2 Nonlinear Wavemaker Equations

While the linear wavemaker equations provide a useful starting point for understanding wave generation and propagation, they are limited in their ability to capture the complex dynamics of real-world systems. In particular, they do not account for the nonlinear effects that can arise in fluid dynamics, such as wave-wave interactions and wave breaking.

The nonlinear wavemaker equations are a set of differential equations that describe the motion of a wavemaker in a fluid medium, taking into account these nonlinear effects. These equations are derived from the principles of nonlinear wave theory and the assumptions of the nonlinear wavemaker theory.

The nonlinear wavemaker equations are given by:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \frac{\partial^2 \eta}{\partial x^2} &= 0 \\
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} &= \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac{1}{2} \eta^2 \right)
\end{align*}
$$

where $\eta$ is the wave amplitude, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the wave speed. These equations describe the propagation of a wave in the $x$ direction with a speed $c$, taking into account the nonlinear effects of wave-wave interactions and wave breaking.

The nonlinear wavemaker equations are used to study the generation and propagation of waves in a fluid medium, taking into account the complex dynamics of real-world systems. They are particularly useful for studying the interaction of waves with ships and offshore energy systems, where nonlinear effects can play a crucial role.

#### 6.2b.3 Wavemaker Strength and the Nonlinear Wavemaker Equations

The wavemaker strength, $K$, also plays a crucial role in the nonlinear wavemaker equations. As mentioned earlier, the wavemaker strength is defined as the ratio of the wave amplitude to the wavemaker velocity. It is given by the equation:

$$
K = \frac{A}{U}
$$

where $A$ is the wave amplitude and $U$ is the wavemaker velocity. The wavemaker strength is a dimensionless parameter that characterizes the efficiency of a wavemaker.

In the nonlinear wavemaker equations, the wavemaker strength plays a more complex role. As the wavemaker strength increases, the wave speed $c$ decreases, leading to an increase in the dispersion relation. This results in an increase in the wave amplitude, which is proportional to the wave speed. Therefore, as the wavemaker strength increases, the wave amplitude increases, leading to an increase in the wavemaker efficiency.

However, this increase in wave amplitude can also lead to the onset of nonlinear effects, such as wave-wave interactions and wave breaking. These effects can limit the efficiency of the wavemaker, and the nonlinear wavemaker equations provide a way to account for these effects.

In conclusion, the wavemaker strength plays a crucial role in the nonlinear wavemaker equations, both in terms of the wavemaker efficiency and the onset of nonlinear effects. Understanding the relationship between the wavemaker strength and the nonlinear wavemaker equations is essential for studying the generation and propagation of waves in a fluid medium.

These equations are derived from the basic principles of fluid dynamics and wave theory, and they provide a mathematical framework for understanding the complex behavior of nonlinear waves.

The nonlinear wavemaker equations can be written in the following form:

$$
\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial t} + c\frac{\partial \eta}{\partial x} + \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\eta^2\right) + \frac{1}{6}\frac{\partial^3 \eta}{\partial x^3} = 0
$$

where $\eta$ is the wave amplitude, $t$ is time, $x$ is the spatial coordinate, and $c$ is the wave speed. The first term on the left-hand side represents the temporal evolution of the wave amplitude, the second term represents the advection of the wave amplitude, and the third and fourth terms represent the nonlinear and cubic dispersion effects, respectively.

The nonlinear wavemaker equations are a simplified form of the more general nonlinear Schrödinger equation, which describes the propagation of nonlinear waves in a variety of physical systems. The nonlinear wavemaker equations are particularly useful for studying the generation of nonlinear waves by wavemakers, as they capture the essential nonlinear effects without the complexity of the full nonlinear Schrödinger equation.

The nonlinear wavemaker equations can be used to derive the Manley-Rowe relations, which describe the conservation of wave action in nonlinear wave interactions. These relations are given by:

$$
\frac{d}{dx}\left(A_1A_2^*\right) + \frac{d}{dx}\left(A_2A_3^*\right) + \frac{d}{dx}\left(A_3A_1^*\right) = 0
$$

where $A_1$, $A_2$, and $A_3$ are the amplitudes of the three waves involved in the interaction. These relations are a direct consequence of the nonlinear wavemaker equations and provide a powerful tool for analyzing nonlinear wave interactions.

#### 6.4a Definition of Wavemaker Efficiency

Wavemaker efficiency is a critical concept in the study of ocean waves and their interaction with ships and offshore energy systems. It is defined as the ratio of the power output of the wavemaker to the power input. In other words, it is a measure of how effectively the wavemaker converts the input power into wave energy.

The efficiency of a wavemaker is influenced by several factors, including the design of the wavemaker, the properties of the fluid (in this case, the ocean water), and the frequency of the wave. The efficiency can be calculated using the following equation:

$$
\eta = \frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}}
$$

where $\eta$ is the efficiency, $P_{out}$ is the power output of the wavemaker, and $P_{in}$ is the power input.

The efficiency of a wavemaker is a crucial factor in the design and operation of ships and offshore energy systems. A wavemaker with high efficiency can generate waves with less power input, which can save energy and reduce the cost of operation. Furthermore, a high efficiency wavemaker can generate waves with a specific frequency and amplitude, which is essential for many applications, such as wave energy conversion and wave testing of ships.

In the next sections, we will discuss the factors that influence wavemaker efficiency and how to improve the efficiency of wavemakers.

#### 6.4b Factors Affecting Wavemaker Efficiency

The design of the wavemaker plays a crucial role in its efficiency. The design factors include the shape of the wavemaker, the material used, and the method of power input.

The shape of the wavemaker is particularly important. The shape determines the frequency and amplitude of the waves that the wavemaker can generate. A well-designed wavemaker can generate waves with a specific frequency and amplitude, which can improve the efficiency of the wavemaker.

The material used in the construction of the wavemaker also affects its efficiency. The material should be strong enough to withstand the forces exerted by the waves and the fluid. It should also have good electrical conductivity to facilitate the transfer of power.

The method of power input is another important factor. The power input can be through an electrical connection or through a mechanical connection. The efficiency of the wavemaker can be improved by using a method that minimizes power loss during the transfer of power.

##### Environmental Factors

The properties of the fluid (in this case, the ocean water) and the frequency of the wave also affect the efficiency of the wavemaker.

The properties of the fluid include its density, viscosity, and surface tension. These properties can affect the propagation of the waves and the efficiency of the wavemaker. For example, a higher density of the fluid can increase the resistance to the propagation of the waves, which can decrease the efficiency of the wavemaker.

The frequency of the wave is another important factor. The efficiency of the wavemaker can be improved by operating at a frequency that matches the natural frequency of the wavemaker. This can be achieved by adjusting the design of the wavemaker or by using a frequency controller.

In the next section, we will discuss how to improve the efficiency of wavemakers by optimizing these factors.

$$
\eta = \frac{P_{out}}{P_{in}}
$$

where $\eta$ is the efficiency, $P_{out}$ is the power output, and $P_{in}$ is the power input.

##### Indirect Methods

Indirect methods involve measuring other parameters and using these measurements to calculate the efficiency. These methods can be less accurate than direct methods, but they can be useful when direct measurements are not feasible.

One common indirect method is the use of the Strouhal number, which is defined as the ratio of the wavemaker's length to the wave's wavelength. The Strouhal number can be calculated using the equation:

$$
S = \frac{L}{\lambda}
$$

where $S$ is the Strouhal number, $L$ is the length of the wavemaker, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the wave. The efficiency can then be estimated using the Strouhal number and other parameters, such as the wavemaker's shape and the properties of the fluid.

Another indirect method is the use of the wavemaker's frequency response, which is the relationship between the frequency of the wave and the amplitude of the wave. The frequency response can be measured using a spectrum analyzer, and the efficiency can be estimated using the frequency response and other parameters.

In the next section, we will discuss how to improve the efficiency of wavemakers.

##### Geometry of the Wavemaker

The geometry of the wavemaker, including its shape and size, plays a significant role in its efficiency. The Strouhal number, as discussed in the previous section, is a key parameter that influences the efficiency. A wavemaker with a higher Strouhal number tends to have a higher efficiency.

Similarly, a wavemaker generating waves at a higher frequency will have a higher efficiency compared to the same wavemaker generating waves at a lower frequency. This is because the wavemaker needs to generate more waves to maintain a constant wave energy at a higher frequency.

##### Wavemaker Material

The material of the wavemaker can also affect its efficiency. For instance, a wavemaker made of a material with a high density will have a lower efficiency compared to the same wavemaker made of a material with a lower density.

#### 7.1a Definition of Eulerian and Lagrangian Descriptions

In the study of ocean waves, it is essential to understand the concepts of Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions. These descriptions are used to describe the motion of fluid particles in the ocean. The Eulerian description is based on the position of a fluid particle at a fixed point in space, while the Lagrangian description follows the motion of a specific fluid particle.

The Eulerian description is based on the concept of a flow field, where the flow velocity is represented by a function $\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x}, t)$. This function describes the velocity of a fluid particle at a fixed position $\mathbf{x}$ and time $t$. The Eulerian description is useful for understanding the overall behavior of ocean waves, as it allows us to track the movement of fluid particles over time.

On the other hand, the Lagrangian description follows the motion of a specific fluid particle, labeled by a vector field $\mathbf{x}_0$. The position of this particle at time $t$ is described by the function $\mathbf{X}(\mathbf{x}_0, t)$. This description is useful for understanding the individual behavior of fluid particles and their interactions with other particles.

The two descriptions are related as follows:

$$
\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{X}(\mathbf{x}_0, t), t) = \frac{\partial \mathbf{X}}{\partial t} (\mathbf{x}_0, t)
$$

This equation describes the velocity of a fluid particle at a fixed position $\mathbf{X}(\mathbf{x}_0, t)$ and time $t$, as seen from the Eulerian description. It is also equal to the derivative of the position of the fluid particle with respect to time, as seen from the Lagrangian description.

In the context of ocean waves, the Eulerian and Lagrangian descriptions are crucial for understanding the behavior of waves and their interactions with ships and offshore energy systems. By using these descriptions, we can accurately predict the movement of ocean waves and their impact on these systems. In the next section, we will explore the concept of translating coordinate systems, which is essential for understanding the interaction between ocean waves and these systems.

## Properties of the Lagrangian

### Non-uniqueness

The Lagrangian of a given system is not unique. A Lagrangian "L" can be multiplied by a nonzero constant "a" and shifted by an arbitrary constant "b", and the new Lagrangian "L' = aL" + "b" will describe the same motion as "L". If one restricts as above to trajectories $\mathbf{q}$ over a given time interval $[t_\text{st},t_\text{fin}]$ and fixed end points $P_\text{st} = \mathbf{q}(t_\text{st})$ and $P_\text{fin} = \mathbf{q}(t_\text{fin})$, then two Lagrangians describing the same system can differ by the "total time derivative" of a function $f(\mathbf{q},t)$:

where $\textstyle \frac{\mathrm{d}f(\mathbf{q},t)}{\mathrm{d}t}$ means $\textstyle \frac{\partial f(\mathbf{q},t)}{\partial t}+\sum_i \frac{\partial f(\mathbf{q},t)}{\partial q_i} {\dot q}_i.$

Both Lagrangians $L$ and $L'$ produce the same equations of motion since the corresponding actions $S$ and $S'$ are related via

$$
S'[\mathbf{q}] = \int\limits^{t_\text{fin}}_{t_\text{st}} L'(\mathbf{q}(t),\dot\mathbf{q}(t),t)\,dt = \int\limits^{t_\text{fin}}_{t_\text{st}} L(\mathbf{q}(t),\dot\mathbf{q}(t),t)\,dt + \int^{t_\text{fin}}_{t_\text{st}} \frac{\mathrm{d}f(\mathbf{q}(t),t)}{\mathrm{d}t}\, dt \\ =
S[\mathbf{q}] + f(P_\text{fin},t_\text{fin}) - f(P_\text{st},t_\text{st}),
$$

with the last two components $f(P_\text{fin},t_\text{fin})$ and $f(P_\text{st},t_\text{st})$ independent of $\mathbf q$.

### Invariance under point transformations

Given a set of generalized coordinates $q$, if we change these variables to a new set of generalized coordinates $s$ according to a point transformation $q = q(s, "t"),$ the new Lagrangian "L'" is a function of the new coordinates

$$
L' = L(s, \dot{s}, t).
$$

By the chain rule for partial differentiation, Lagrange's equations are invariant under this transformation;
$$
\frac{d}{dt} \left( \frac{\partial L'}{\partial \dot{s}_i} \right) - \frac{\partial L'}{\partial s_i} = 0,
$$
where $s_i$ are the components of $s$. This invariance under point transformations is a fundamental property of the Lagrangian description and is crucial for understanding the behavior of fluid particles in the ocean.

# Averaged Lagrangian

### Slowly-varying waves

#### Slowly-varying linear waves

Whitham developed several approaches to obtain an averaged Lagrangian method. The simplest one is for slowly-varying linear wavetrains, which method will be applied here.

The slowly-varying wavetrain –without mean motion– in a linear dispersive system is described as:

<math display="block">
</math> with <math display="block">a = \left| A \right|</math> and <math display="block">\alpha = \arg\left\{ A \right\},</math>

where <math>\theta(\boldsymbol{x},t)</math> is the real-valued wave phase, <math>|A|</math> denotes the absolute value of the complex-valued amplitude <math>A(\boldsymbol{x},t),</math> while <math>\arg\{A\}</math> is its argument and <math>\Re\{A\}</math> denotes its real part. The real-valued amplitude and phase shift are denoted by <math>a</math> and <math>\alpha</math> respectively.

Now, "by definition", the angular frequency <math>\omega</math> and wavenumber vector <math>\boldsymbol{k}</math> are expressed as the time derivative and gradient of the wave phase <math>\theta(\boldsymbol{x},t)</math> as:

<math display="block">\omega \equiv -\partial_t \theta</math> and <math display="block">\boldsymbol{k} \equiv +\boldsymbol{\nabla} \theta.</math>

As a consequence, <math>\omega(\boldsymbol{x},t)</math> and <math>\boldsymbol{k}(\boldsymbol{x},t)</math> have to satisfy the consistency relations:

<math display="block">\partial_t \boldsymbol{k} + \boldsymbol{\nabla} \omega = \boldsymbol{0}</math> and <math display="block">\boldsymbol{\nabla} \times \boldsymbol{k}=\boldsymbol{0}.</math>

These two consistency relations denote the "conservation of wave crests", and the irrotationality of the wavenumber field.

Because of the assumption of slow variations in the wave train – as well as in a possible inhomogeneous medium and mean motion – the quantities <math>A,</math> <math>a,</math> <math>\omega,</math> <math>\boldsymbol{k}</math> and <math>\alpha</math> all vary slowly

This allows us to understand how the structure affects the wave, and how the wave affects the structure.

Overall, the translation of coordinate systems is a crucial aspect of understanding wave dynamics. By translating the coordinate system to the location of the structure, we can study the behavior of the wave as it interacts with the structure. This allows us to better understand the effects of the structure on the wave, and vice versa.
