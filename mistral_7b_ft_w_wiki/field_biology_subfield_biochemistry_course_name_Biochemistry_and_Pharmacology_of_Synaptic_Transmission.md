### Subsection: 1.1b Historical overview of neurotransmitters

The study of neurotransmitters has a long and complex history, dating back to the early 19th century when scientists first began to explore the chemical processes involved in the nervous system. In the 1840s, German physiologist Hermann von Helmholtz proposed the concept of chemical transmission between neurons, suggesting that chemical substances released by one neuron could influence the activity of another. However, it was not until the early 20th century that scientists began to identify and study specific neurotransmitters.

One of the first major breakthroughs in the field of neurotransmitters came in 1921, when Otto Loewi demonstrated the existence of acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter. Loewi's experiments involved stimulating the vagus nerve and measuring the resulting changes in heart rate. He found that the heart rate changes were not due to the direct stimulation of the nerve, but rather to the release of a chemical substance from the nerve. This substance was later identified as acetylcholine, and its discovery marked a significant step forward in our understanding of synaptic transmission.

In the 1930s, Irvine Page published the first major textbook on neurochemistry, highlighting the importance of chemical processes in the nervous system. He also established the first department dedicated to the study of neurochemistry at the Munich Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Psychiatry.

The 1950s saw further advancements in the field of neurotransmitters, with the discovery of other important neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and dopamine. These discoveries led to a deeper understanding of the complex chemical processes involved in the nervous system.

Today, the study of neurotransmitters continues to be a major focus in the field of neuroscience. With the development of advanced techniques and technologies, scientists are able to study these chemical messengers in greater detail, providing new insights into their role in synaptic transmission and neurological disorders.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of neurotransmitters, their synthesis and metabolism, and their actions on different types of receptors. We will also discuss the role of neurotransmitters in various neurological disorders and the development of pharmacological agents to treat these disorders.





### Subsection: 1.1c Types of neurotransmitters

Neurotransmitters can be broadly classified into two categories: excitatory and inhibitory. Excitatory neurotransmitters increase the likelihood of a neuron firing, while inhibitory neurotransmitters decrease this likelihood. The most prevalent excitatory neurotransmitter is glutamate, which is used in over 90% of synapses in the human brain. The next most prevalent is gamma-Aminobutyric Acid (GABA), which is inhibitory at more than 90% of the synapses that do not use glutamate.

In addition to these major neurotransmitters, there are also many other types of neurotransmitters that are used in smaller proportions of synapses. These include acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin. Each of these neurotransmitters plays a crucial role in various physiological processes and can have significant effects on behavior and cognition.

#### 1.1c.1 Amino Acid Neurotransmitters

Amino acid neurotransmitters are a class of neurotransmitters that are derived from amino acids. Glutamate and GABA are the most well-known examples of this class. These neurotransmitters are synthesized from amino acids and are involved in a wide range of physiological processes.

#### 1.1c.2 Peptide Neurotransmitters

Peptide neurotransmitters are a class of neurotransmitters that are derived from peptides. These neurotransmitters are synthesized from longer chains of amino acids and are involved in a variety of physiological processes. Beta-Endorphin is a well-known example of a peptide neurotransmitter that engages in highly specific interactions with opioid receptors in the central nervous system.

#### 1.1c.3 Monoamine Neurotransmitters

Monoamine neurotransmitters are a class of neurotransmitters that are derived from monoamines. These neurotransmitters are synthesized from amines and are involved in a variety of physiological processes. Dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin are the most well-known examples of this class.

#### 1.1c.4 Single Ions and Gaseous Molecules

Single ions, such as zinc, and gaseous molecules, such as nitric oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), and hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), are also considered neurotransmitters by some. These molecules are produced in the neural cytoplasm and are immediately diffused through the cell membrane into the extracellular fluid and into nearby cells to stimulate production of second messengers. Soluble gas neurotransmitters are difficult to study, as they act rapidly and are immediately broken down, existing for only a few seconds.

In conclusion, the study of neurotransmitters is a complex and ever-evolving field. The classification of neurotransmitters into different types is crucial for understanding their roles in various physiological processes and their effects on behavior and cognition.




### Subsection: 1.2a Structure and function of neurons

Neurons are the fundamental building blocks of the nervous system. They are specialized cells that are responsible for transmitting information from one part of the body to another. The basic structure of a neuron consists of a cell body, dendrites, and an axon. The cell body, or soma, is where the nucleus and other organelles are located. Dendrites are short, branching processes that receive incoming signals from other neurons. The axon is a long, thin process that carries the output signal from the neuron to other cells.

The structure of neurons is closely related to their function. The dendrites receive incoming signals, which are then processed by the cell body. The cell body then determines whether to pass the signal on to the axon or to inhibit it. The axon then transmits the signal to other cells, such as muscle cells or other neurons.

Neurons are also responsible for the transmission of information between different parts of the body. This is achieved through the process of synaptic transmission, where a neuron sends a signal to another neuron across a synapse. The synapse is a small gap between two neurons that is filled with a fluid containing neurotransmitters. When a neuron is stimulated, it releases these neurotransmitters into the synapse, which then bind to receptors on the receiving neuron, causing it to fire.

The structure and function of neurons are crucial for the proper functioning of the nervous system. Any disruptions in the structure or function of neurons can lead to various neurological disorders. For example, damage to the axon can lead to conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), while damage to the dendrites can lead to conditions such as Alzheimer's disease.

In addition to their role in information transmission, neurons also play a crucial role in learning and memory. The synapse is a dynamic structure that can change in response to experience, a process known as synaptic plasticity. This plasticity allows neurons to adapt and learn, and is essential for the formation of new connections and the strengthening of existing ones.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of neurons and their specific functions in the nervous system.





### Subsection: 1.2b Neurotransmitter release and vesicle trafficking

Neurotransmitter release and vesicle trafficking are crucial processes in synaptic transmission. These processes are responsible for the efficient and precise transmission of information between neurons. In this section, we will explore the mechanisms of neurotransmitter release and vesicle trafficking, and their role in synaptic transmission.

#### Neurotransmitter Release

Neurotransmitters are small molecules that are responsible for transmitting information between neurons. They are stored in synaptic vesicles, which are small, membrane-bound structures located in the presynaptic neuron. When a neuron is stimulated, these vesicles are released from the presynaptic neuron and fuse with the presynaptic membrane, releasing the neurotransmitter into the synapse.

The process of neurotransmitter release is highly regulated and involves a complex signaling cascade. The most well-known mechanism of neurotransmitter release is calcium-dependent exocytosis. In this process, an action potential traveling down the axon causes the release of calcium ions from intracellular stores. These calcium ions then bind to specific receptors on the synaptic vesicle, triggering the fusion of the vesicle with the presynaptic membrane and the release of the neurotransmitter.

#### Vesicle Trafficking

After the neurotransmitter is released, the synaptic vesicle is retrieved from the presynaptic membrane through a process called endocytosis. This process is crucial for the recycling of synaptic vesicles and the efficient transmission of information. The retrieved vesicle is then transported back to the presynaptic neuron, where it is refilled with neurotransmitter and ready for future release.

The process of vesicle trafficking is highly regulated and involves multiple proteins and signaling pathways. One of the key proteins involved in vesicle trafficking is the synaptic vesicle protein 2 (SV2). SV2 is a transmembrane protein that is essential for the proper trafficking of synaptic vesicles. Mutations in the SV2 gene have been linked to various neurological disorders, highlighting the importance of this protein in synaptic transmission.

#### Synaptic Vesicle Recycling

As mentioned earlier, the synaptic vesicle is retrieved from the presynaptic membrane after neurotransmitter release. This process is crucial for the efficient transmission of information, as it allows for the rapid refilling of the vesicle and subsequent release of neurotransmitter. There are two main pathways for synaptic vesicle recycling: clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) and activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE).

CME is a well-characterized pathway that involves the formation of clathrin-coated pits on the presynaptic membrane. These pits then invaginate and pinch off, forming vesicles that are transported back to the presynaptic neuron. ADBE, on the other hand, is a more recently discovered pathway that is activated during periods of high neuronal activity. It involves the bulk endocytosis of the entire presynaptic membrane, resulting in the retrieval of multiple synaptic vesicles at once.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, neurotransmitter release and vesicle trafficking are crucial processes in synaptic transmission. They are highly regulated and involve multiple proteins and signaling pathways. The proper functioning of these processes is essential for the efficient and precise transmission of information between neurons. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of neurotransmitter release and vesicle trafficking and their role in synaptic transmission.





### Subsection: 1.2c Postsynaptic receptors and signaling pathways

The postsynaptic receptors play a crucial role in the transmission of information across the synapse. These receptors are responsible for detecting and responding to the released neurotransmitter, and initiating a signaling cascade that leads to changes in neuronal activity. In this section, we will explore the different types of postsynaptic receptors and their signaling pathways.

#### Types of Postsynaptic Receptors

There are two main types of postsynaptic receptors: ionotropic and metabotropic. Ionotropic receptors are directly gated by the neurotransmitter and allow for the rapid transmission of information. They are typically ligand-gated ion channels that open upon binding of the neurotransmitter, allowing for the influx of ions and depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron. Metabotropic receptors, on the other hand, are coupled to G proteins and initiate a signaling cascade that leads to changes in neuronal activity. These receptors are typically G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are activated by the binding of the neurotransmitter.

#### Signaling Pathways

The signaling pathways initiated by postsynaptic receptors are crucial for the transmission of information across the synapse. Ionotropic receptors, upon binding of the neurotransmitter, open ion channels and allow for the influx of ions, leading to depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron. This depolarization can trigger an action potential, which is a rapid and all-or-none response that allows for the transmission of information down the axon. Metabotropic receptors, on the other hand, initiate a signaling cascade that leads to changes in neuronal activity. This can include changes in gene expression, protein synthesis, and other cellular processes that can have long-lasting effects on neuronal function.

#### Postsynaptic Density

The postsynaptic density (PSD) is a protein-rich region located at the postsynaptic membrane. It is responsible for anchoring postsynaptic receptors and signaling molecules, and plays a crucial role in synaptic transmission. The PSD is also a site of synaptic plasticity, where changes in the strength and function of synapses can occur. This is important for learning and memory processes, as well as for the development and maintenance of neural circuits.

### Conclusion

In this section, we have explored the different types of postsynaptic receptors and their signaling pathways. These receptors and pathways are crucial for the transmission of information across the synapse and play a vital role in learning, memory, and neural circuit development. The postsynaptic density, a protein-rich region at the postsynaptic membrane, is also a key player in synaptic transmission and plasticity. Further research and understanding of these processes will continue to advance our knowledge of synaptic transmission and its role in the nervous system.
