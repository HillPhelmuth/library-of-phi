### Section 1.1a Basic Concepts

#### 1.1a.1 Light

Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation that is visible to the human eye. It is a fundamental concept in optical engineering, as it is the source of information in many optical systems. The properties of light, such as its wavelength, frequency, and polarization, determine how it interacts with matter and how it can be manipulated for various applications.

Light can be described as a wave or a particle, depending on the context. As a wave, light is characterized by its wavelength ($\lambda$), frequency ($f$), and speed ($c$), where $c = \lambda f$. The wavelength of light determines its color, with longer wavelengths appearing red and shorter wavelengths appearing blue. The frequency of light determines its energy, with higher frequencies having more energy.

As a particle, light is described as a stream of massless particles called photons. Each photon carries a specific amount of energy, given by the equation $E = h\nu$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $\nu$ is the frequency of the light.

#### 1.1a.2 Imaging

Imaging is the process of forming an image of an object. In optical engineering, imaging is a fundamental concept, as it is the basis for many optical systems, such as cameras and microscopes.

An image is a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional scene. It is formed by projecting the scene onto a plane, known as the image plane. The points on the image plane that correspond to the points in the scene are the image points.

The formation of an image involves the transformation of the scene from the object space to the image space. This transformation is governed by the principles of perspective projection, which states that the image of a point in the scene is the intersection of the line from the point to the observer's eye with the image plane.

#### 1.1a.3 Optical Communication

Optical communication is the transmission of information using light. It is a key application of optical engineering, with applications in telecommunications, data centers, and wireless communication.

Optical communication systems use light to carry information over long distances with minimal loss. This is achieved by using optical fibers, which are thin strands of glass or plastic that guide light along their length. The information is encoded into the light, typically using modulation techniques, and is then transmitted through the fibers.

The properties of light, such as its wavelength and frequency, play a crucial role in optical communication. For example, different wavelengths of light can be used to carry different streams of data, allowing for the transmission of multiple signals simultaneously.

#### 1.1a.4 Optical Sensing and Measurement

Optical sensing and measurement is the use of light to measure physical quantities. It is a key application of optical engineering, with applications in a wide range of fields, including biomedicine, environmental monitoring, and industrial automation.

Optical sensing and measurement involves the use of light to detect and measure the properties of objects or phenomena. This can be achieved using various techniques, such as absorption spectroscopy, which measures the amount of light absorbed by a substance, or interferometry, which measures the interference pattern of light waves.

The properties of light, such as its wavelength and frequency, are crucial in optical sensing and measurement. For example, the wavelength of light can be used to identify different substances, as different substances absorb light at different wavelengths.




### Section 1.1b Applications of Statistical Optics

Statistical optics is a branch of optics that deals with the statistical analysis of light. It is a powerful tool for understanding and predicting the behavior of light in various optical systems. In this section, we will discuss some of the key applications of statistical optics in optical engineering.

#### 1.1b.1 Gaussian Brackets

Gaussian brackets, also known as the Gauss-Seidel method, are a numerical technique used to solve a system of linear equations. They have been applied in various areas of optics, including the design of optical systems and the analysis of light propagation.

The Gaussian brackets method is particularly useful in the design of optical systems, where it is often necessary to solve a system of linear equations to determine the properties of the system. For example, in the design of a lens system, the Gaussian brackets method can be used to determine the focal length of each lens in the system.

#### 1.1b.2 Interferometric Scattering Microscopy

Interferometric Scattering Microscopy (iSCAT) is a powerful technique for imaging biological samples at the single-molecule level. It has been used in multiple applications, including the study of protein-protein interactions and the dynamics of molecular motors.

iSCAT is based on the principle of interferometric scattering, which involves the scattering of light by a sample. The scattered light is then collected and analyzed to form an image of the sample. By using iSCAT, it is possible to achieve a resolution of a few nanometers, which is much higher than the diffraction limit of conventional microscopy.

#### 1.1b.3 Line Integral Convolution

Line Integral Convolution (LIC) is a numerical technique used to solve partial differential equations. It has been applied to a wide range of problems since it was first published in 1993.

In the context of optics, LIC has been used to analyze the propagation of light in various optical systems. For example, it has been used to study the propagation of light in waveguides and the scattering of light by random media.

#### 1.1b.4 Color Filter Array

A Color Filter Array (CFA) is a device used to capture color images. It consists of an array of color filters, each of which captures a different color component of the image.

The design of a CFA is a complex task that requires careful consideration of various factors, including the spectral properties of the light source, the sensitivity of the image sensor, and the interplay between the CFA and the microlenses. Statistical optics provides a powerful tool for analyzing these factors and optimizing the design of the CFA.

#### 1.1b.5 Moment Distance Index

The Moment Distance Index (MDI) is a statistical measure used to compare the spectral reflectance of two points in a scene. It is defined as the difference in the moment distance from the left and right pivots, and it is given by the equation:

$$
MDI = MD_{LP} - MD_{RP}
$$

where $MD_{RP}$ and $MD_{LP}$ are the moment distances from the right and left pivots, respectively. The MDI is a useful tool for analyzing the spectral properties of a scene and for designing optical systems that can accurately capture these properties.




### Section 1.1c Advanced Topics in Statistical Optics

In this section, we will delve deeper into the advanced topics of statistical optics, focusing on the concept of moment distance index and its applications in waveform LiDAR data.

#### 1.1c.1 Moment Distance Index

The moment distance index (MDI) is a statistical measure used to quantify the distance between two points in a data set. It is particularly useful in the analysis of waveform LiDAR data, where it can be used to compare the spectral reflectance at different wavelengths.

The MDI is calculated as the difference between the moment distance from the left pivot (MD<sub>LP</sub>) and the moment distance from the right pivot (MD<sub>RP</sub>). The moment distance from the left pivot (MD<sub>LP</sub>) is the sum of the hypotenuses constructed from the left pivot to the power at successively later times, while the moment distance from the right pivot (MD<sub>RP</sub>) is the sum of the hypotenuses constructed from the right pivot to the power at successively earlier times.

The MDI can be calculated for both waveform LiDAR data and spectral LiDAR data. For waveform LiDAR data, the MDI is given as:

$$
MDI = MD_{LP} - MD_{RP}
$$

where:

$$
MD_{RP} = \textstyle \sum_{i=t_{RP}}^{t_{LP}} \displaystyle(\rho_i^2+ ({t_{RP}}-i)^2)^{0.5}
$$

$$
MD_{LP} = \textstyle \sum_{i=t_{LP}}^{t_{RP}} \displaystyle(\rho_i^2+ (i-{t_{LP}})^2)^{0.5}
$$

For spectral LiDAR data, the MDI is given as:

$$
MDI = MD_{LP} - MD_{RP}
$$

where:

$$
MD_{RP} = \textstyle \sum_{i=\lambda_{RP}}^{\lambda_{LP}} \displaystyle(\rho_i^2+ ({\lambda_{RP}}-i)^2)^{0.5}
$$

$$
MD_{LP} = \textstyle \sum_{i=\lambda_{LP}}^{\lambda_{RP}} \displaystyle(\rho_i^2+ (i-{\lambda_{LP}})^2)^{0.5}
$$

The MDI can be used to quantify the distance between two points in a data set, providing valuable insights into the properties of the data. It can also be used to compare different data sets, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of the data.

#### 1.1c.2 Applications of Moment Distance Index

The moment distance index (MDI) has been applied in various areas of optics, including the analysis of waveform LiDAR data. The MDI can be used to compare the spectral reflectance at different wavelengths, providing valuable insights into the properties of the data.

For example, in the analysis of waveform LiDAR data, the MDI can be used to compare the spectral reflectance at different wavelengths. This can be particularly useful in the analysis of complex data sets, where the MDI can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the data.

In addition, the MDI can also be used to compare different data sets, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of the data. This can be particularly useful in the analysis of spectral LiDAR data, where the MDI can be used to compare the spectral reflectance at different wavelengths.

In conclusion, the moment distance index (MDI) is a powerful tool in the analysis of optical data. Its applications in waveform LiDAR data and spectral LiDAR data make it a valuable tool in the field of statistical optics.




### Section 1.2 Inverse Problems

Inverse problems are a fundamental concept in the field of optical engineering. They involve the process of determining the cause of a phenomenon based on the observed effect. In the context of light and imaging, inverse problems can be used to reconstruct the original image from a distorted or noisy version, or to determine the properties of a light source based on the observed light.

#### 1.2a Introduction to Inverse Problems

Inverse problems are often ill-posed, meaning that they are sensitive to noise and small changes in the input data. This is due to the fact that the inverse problem is typically an underdetermined system, where there are more unknowns than equations. This can lead to multiple solutions or no solution at all.

One approach to solving inverse problems is through the use of regularization. Regularization involves adding a penalty term to the objective function, which helps to control the solution space and prevent overfitting. The regularization parameter, denoted by $\lambda$, controls the trade-off between fitting the data and minimizing the penalty term.

Another approach to solving inverse problems is through the use of the method of least squares. This method involves minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals, which are the differences between the observed data and the model predictions. The least squares method can be extended to handle multiple input variables and multiple output variables.

In the context of light and imaging, inverse problems can be used to reconstruct the original image from a distorted or noisy version. This is particularly useful in applications such as image restoration and enhancement, where the goal is to improve the quality of an image that has been degraded by noise or other distortions.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of inverse problems and explore some of the techniques used to solve them.

#### 1.2b Techniques for Solving Inverse Problems

In this section, we will explore some of the techniques used to solve inverse problems in the field of optical engineering. These techniques include the method of least squares, regularization, and the use of the L-curve method.

##### Least Squares Method

The least squares method is a common approach to solving inverse problems. It involves minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals, which are the differences between the observed data and the model predictions. The least squares method can be extended to handle multiple input variables and multiple output variables.

The least squares method can be formulated as the following optimization problem:

$$
\min_{\mathbf{x}} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - f_i(\mathbf{x}))^2
$$

where $\mathbf{x}$ is the vector of unknown parameters, $y_i$ are the observed data, and $f_i(\mathbf{x})$ are the model predictions.

##### Regularization

Regularization is another approach to solving inverse problems. It involves adding a penalty term to the objective function, which helps to control the solution space and prevent overfitting. The regularization parameter, denoted by $\lambda$, controls the trade-off between fitting the data and minimizing the penalty term.

The regularized least squares problem can be formulated as the following optimization problem:

$$
\min_{\mathbf{x}} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - f_i(\mathbf{x}))^2 + \lambda \Omega(\mathbf{x})
$$

where $\Omega(\mathbf{x})$ is the regularization term.

##### L-Curve Method

The L-curve method is a graphical technique used to select the regularization parameter $\lambda$ in the regularized least squares problem. The L-curve is a plot of the residual sum of squares (RSS) versus the residual sum of squares divided by the norm of the parameter vector (RSR). The point where the L-curve bends over is the point where the trade-off between fitting the data and minimizing the penalty term is optimal.

The L-curve method can be used to select the regularization parameter $\lambda$ in the regularized least squares problem. The L-curve is a plot of the residual sum of squares (RSS) versus the residual sum of squares divided by the norm of the parameter vector (RSR). The point where the L-curve bends over is the point where the trade-off between fitting the data and minimizing the penalty term is optimal.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of inverse problems and explore some of the techniques used to solve them.

#### 1.2c Applications of Inverse Problems

In this section, we will explore some of the applications of inverse problems in the field of optical engineering. These applications include image reconstruction, deblurring, and the estimation of optical properties.

##### Image Reconstruction

Inverse problems are often used in image reconstruction. For example, in computed tomography (CT), an inverse problem is used to reconstruct a 3D image of a body part from a set of 2D projections. The inverse problem is formulated as a linear system of equations, which can be solved using techniques such as the least squares method or regularization.

##### Deblurring

Inverse problems are also used in deblurring, which is the process of removing blur from an image. The blurring process can be modeled as a convolution, which is a linear operation. Therefore, the deblurring problem can be formulated as an inverse problem and solved using techniques such as the least squares method or regularization.

##### Estimation of Optical Properties

Inverse problems are used in the estimation of optical properties, such as the refractive index or the absorption coefficient of a medium. These properties can be estimated from measurements of the light field, which can be modeled as a linear system of equations. The inverse problem is then solved using techniques such as the least squares method or regularization.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of inverse problems and explore some of the techniques used to solve them.
