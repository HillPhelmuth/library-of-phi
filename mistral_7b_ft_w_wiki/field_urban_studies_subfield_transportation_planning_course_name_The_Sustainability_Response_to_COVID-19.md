## Applications

The SEI published a study saying 60 organizations measured increases of performance in the categories of cost, schedule, productivity, quality and customer satisfaction. The median increase in performance varied between 14% (customer satisfaction) and 62% (productivity). However, the CMMI model mostly deals with "what" processes should be implemented, and not so much with "how" they can be implemented. These results do not guarantee that applying CMMI will increase performance in every organization. A small company with few resources may be less likely to benefit from CMMI; this view is supported by the process maturity profile (page 10). Of the small organizations (<25 employees), 70.5% are assessed at level 2: Managed, while 52.8% of the organizations with 1,001–2,000 employees are rated at the highest level (5: Optimizing).

Turner & Jain (2002) argue that although it is obvious there are large differences between CMMI and agile software development, both approaches have much in common. They believe neither way is the 'right' way to develop software, but that there are phases in a project where one of the two is better suited. They suggest one should combine the different fragments of the methods into a new hybrid method. Sutherland et al. (2007) assert that a combination of Scrum and CMMI brings more adaptability and predictability than either one alone. David J. Anderson (2005) gives hints on how to interpret CMMI in an agile manner.

CMMI Roadmaps, which are a goal-driven approach to selecting and deploying relevant process areas from the CMMI-DEV model, can provide guidance and focus for effective CMMI adoption. There are several CMMI roadmaps for the continuous representation, each with a specific set of improvement goals. Examples are the CMMI

### Section: 2.4 Strategies for Sustainable Transportation Planning and Design:

#### 2.4a Understanding Sustainable Planning and Design

Sustainable planning and design are integral components of sustainable transportation systems. They involve the careful consideration of environmental, social, and economic factors to create transportation systems that meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

One of the key principles of sustainable planning and design is the concept of integrated modification methodology (IMM). This approach, developed by university research labs, is based on the idea of systemic structure and function, and is used to guide the design and implementation of sustainable transportation systems.

IMM involves a series of steps, including problem identification, analysis, and evaluation. The first step, problem identification, involves defining the specific issues or challenges that need to be addressed in the transportation system. This could include issues related to congestion, air quality, or energy efficiency.

The next step, analysis, involves breaking down the problem into its component parts and examining the relationships between them. This could involve using tools such as system dynamics or agent-based modeling to simulate the behavior of the transportation system and identify potential solutions.

The final step, evaluation, involves assessing the potential solutions identified in the analysis phase. This could involve using criteria such as environmental impact, cost, and feasibility to determine the most effective solution.

Another important aspect of sustainable planning and design is the consideration of the entire life cycle of a transportation system. This includes not only the design and construction of the system, but also its operation, maintenance, and eventual decommissioning. By considering the entire life cycle, planners and designers can ensure that the system is sustainable from start to finish.

In the context of sustainable transportation systems, IMM can be used to guide the design and implementation of clean transportation systems. This could involve the use of electric or hybrid vehicles, the development of public transportation systems, or the promotion of non-motorized transportation modes such as walking and cycling.

The environmental impact of transportation is multifaceted, encompassing air quality, noise pollution, energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions. This section will explore the relationship between sustainable transportation and the environment, focusing on the role of clean transportation systems in mitigating these environmental impacts.

#### 2.5a Understanding Sustainable Transportation and the Environment

Sustainable transportation is a concept that aims to balance the needs of the present and future generations while minimizing the negative impact on the environment. It involves the development and implementation of transportation systems that are environmentally friendly, energy efficient, and socially equitable.

Clean transportation systems are a key component of sustainable transportation. These systems are designed to reduce the environmental impact of transportation, particularly in terms of air quality, noise pollution, energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions. They achieve this through the use of cleaner fuels, more efficient vehicles, and innovative transportation technologies.

One example of a clean transportation system is the use of electric vehicles. These vehicles use electricity as their primary source of energy, reducing the reliance on fossil fuels and thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The use of electric vehicles can also lead to improved air quality, as they produce significantly less pollutants compared to traditional gasoline or diesel vehicles[^2^].

Another example is the development of smart transportation systems. These systems use information and communication technologies to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and improve fuel efficiency. By collecting and analyzing data on traffic patterns, travel times, and vehicle emissions, smart transportation systems can make real-time adjustments to traffic signals, route planning, and vehicle speed limits to minimize environmental impact[^3^].

In addition to these examples, there are many other ways in which sustainable transportation can benefit the environment. These include the use of public transportation, the promotion of non-motorized transportation modes such as walking and cycling, and the implementation of policies and regulations that encourage the use of clean transportation technologies.

In the next section, we will explore these topics in more detail, examining the specific environmental benefits of sustainable transportation and the strategies for achieving them.

##### Surveys

Surveys are a common method used to gather data on public attitudes towards personal mobility. These surveys can be conducted in person, over the phone, or online. They typically involve a set of questions designed to elicit responses about personal mobility preferences, experiences, and attitudes.

For instance, a survey conducted by the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) in 2019 found that a majority of respondents (68%) preferred to walk or bike for short trips, while only 28% preferred to drive. This survey also found that 70% of respondents were concerned about traffic congestion, and 62% were concerned about air pollution from vehicles.

##### Interviews

Interviews can provide more in-depth insights into public attitudes towards personal mobility. These interviews can be structured, where a set of predetermined questions are asked, or unstructured, where the interviewer can follow the respondent's lead.

For example, a study conducted by the University of California, Berkeley in 2018 interviewed a diverse group of commuters in the San Francisco Bay Area. The study found that while many respondents expressed a preference for public transportation, they often chose to drive due to perceived convenience and reliability issues with public transportation.

##### Experiments

Experiments can be used to test hypotheses about public attitudes towards personal mobility. These experiments can involve manipulating variables and observing the resulting changes in attitudes.

For instance, a study conducted by the University of California, Los Angeles in 2017 manipulated the visibility of the evaluator in an online feedback task. The study found that when the evaluator could see the participant, the participant was more likely to discredit positive feedback, particularly if the evaluator was perceived to be prejudiced. This study suggests that visibility can influence how individuals perceive and respond to feedback about personal mobility.

In conclusion, these studies provide valuable insights into public attitudes towards personal mobility. They highlight the importance of considering personal experiences, societal norms, and media influence when understanding these attitudes. They also underscore the need for policies and interventions that address these factors to promote sustainable and clean transportation.
