### Subsection 1.2a Definition of Forces

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of forces and their measurement. In this section, we will delve deeper into the definition of forces and their role in mechanics.

#### 1.2a.1 What is a Force?

A force is a vector quantity that describes the interaction between two objects. It is a fundamental concept in mechanics and is represented by the symbol $F$. Forces can be either contact forces, which occur when two objects physically touch each other, or non-contact forces, which act over a distance, such as gravitational or magnetic forces.

#### 1.2a.2 Types of Forces

There are several types of forces that can act on a body. These include:

1. **Contact Forces**: These are forces that occur when two objects physically touch each other. Examples include friction, tension, and normal force.

2. **Non-Contact Forces**: These are forces that act over a distance. Examples include gravitational force, magnetic force, and electric force.

3. **Resultant Force**: This is the sum of all the forces acting on a body. It is the force that the body experiences and is the key concept in the study of forces.

#### 1.2a.3 Measurement of Forces

As mentioned earlier, forces are measured using devices called force gauges. These devices include spring scales and load cells. The SI unit of force is the newton (symbol N), which is defined as the force required to accelerate a one kilogram mass at a rate of one meter per second squared. The corresponding CGS unit is the dyne, which is defined as the force required to accelerate a one gram mass by one centimeter per second squared.

In the English system, the pound-force (lbf) is defined as the force exerted by gravity on a pound-mass in the standard gravitational field of 9.80665 m·s<sup>−2</sup>. The pound-force provides an alternative unit of mass: one slug is the mass that will accelerate by one foot per second squared when acted on by one pound-force.

#### 1.2a.4 Units of Force

In addition to the newton and the pound-force, there are several other units of force that are used in different systems. These include the kilogram-force (kgf), the sthène, and the kip. Each of these units has its own unique definition and is used in specific contexts.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of moments and their role in equilibrium.




#### 1.2b Definition of Moments

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of forces and their measurement. In this section, we will explore the concept of moments, another fundamental concept in mechanics.

#### 1.2b.1 What is a Moment?

A moment, denoted by the symbol $M$, is a measure of the tendency of a force to cause rotation about a specific point or axis. It is a vector quantity, just like forces, and is represented in the direction of the force and perpendicular to the plane of rotation.

#### 1.2b.2 Types of Moments

There are two types of moments: clockwise moments and counterclockwise moments. A clockwise moment is a moment that causes rotation in a clockwise direction, while a counterclockwise moment causes rotation in a counterclockwise direction.

#### 1.2b.3 Calculating Moments

The moment of a force about a point is calculated by multiplying the magnitude of the force by the perpendicular distance from the point to the line of action of the force. Mathematically, it can be represented as:

$$
M = F \times d
$$

where $M$ is the moment, $F$ is the magnitude of the force, and $d$ is the perpendicular distance from the point to the line of action of the force.

#### 1.2b.4 Units of Moment

The SI unit of moment is the newton-meter (symbol Nm), which is equivalent to the kilogram-meter per second squared. The corresponding CGS unit is the dyne-centimeter (symbol dyn cm), which is equivalent to the gram-centimeter per second squared.

In the English system, the pound-foot-pound (lbf⋅ft⋅lbf) is used as the unit of moment. It is defined as the moment exerted by a pound-force acting through a distance of one foot.

#### 1.2b.5 Equilibrium of Moments

In statics, the equilibrium of moments is a fundamental concept. It states that the sum of all moments acting on a body about any point or axis must be equal to zero for the body to be in equilibrium. This principle is used to solve problems involving rotational equilibrium.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of equilibrium of forces and moments, and how it applies to the study of mechanics.

#### 1.2c Equilibrium of Forces and Moments

In the previous sections, we have discussed the concepts of forces and moments. Now, we will delve into the concept of equilibrium of forces and moments, a fundamental principle in mechanics.

#### 1.2c.1 What is Equilibrium of Forces and Moments?

Equilibrium of forces and moments is a state in which the sum of all forces acting on a body is zero, and the sum of all moments about any point or axis is also zero. This state is necessary for a body to be at rest or moving at a constant velocity.

#### 1.2c.2 Conditions for Equilibrium

The conditions for equilibrium of forces and moments can be expressed mathematically as follows:

1. Equilibrium of forces: The sum of all forces acting on a body is zero. This can be represented as:

$$
\sum F = 0
$$

2. Equilibrium of moments: The sum of all moments about any point or axis is zero. This can be represented as:

$$
\sum M = 0
$$

#### 1.2c.3 Solving Equilibrium Problems

To solve equilibrium problems, we need to apply the conditions of equilibrium to the forces and moments acting on the body. This involves setting up a free-body diagram of the body, identifying all the forces and moments acting on it, and then applying the conditions of equilibrium to solve for the unknown forces and moments.

#### 1.2c.4 Equilibrium of Forces and Moments in Real World Applications

The concept of equilibrium of forces and moments is not just a theoretical concept. It is applied in various real-world applications, such as in the design of structures, machines, and vehicles. For example, in the design of a bridge, engineers need to ensure that the bridge is in equilibrium under the loads it will carry. This involves applying the principles of equilibrium of forces and moments to the forces and moments acting on the bridge.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of equilibrium of forces and moments in more detail, and discuss some practical examples of its application.




#### 1.2c Forces and Moments in Statics

In the previous sections, we have discussed the concepts of forces and moments. Now, we will explore how these concepts are applied in the field of statics.

#### 1.2c.1 Equilibrium of Forces

In statics, the equilibrium of forces is a fundamental concept. It states that the sum of all forces acting on a body must be equal to zero for the body to be in equilibrium. This principle is used to solve problems involving translational equilibrium.

Mathematically, the equilibrium of forces can be represented as:

$$
\sum F = 0
$$

where $\sum F$ is the sum of all forces acting on the body.

#### 1.2c.2 Equilibrium of Moments

As we have learned in the previous section, the equilibrium of moments is also a fundamental concept in statics. It states that the sum of all moments acting on a body about any point or axis must be equal to zero for the body to be in equilibrium. This principle is used to solve problems involving rotational equilibrium.

Mathematically, the equilibrium of moments can be represented as:

$$
\sum M = 0
$$

where $\sum M$ is the sum of all moments acting on the body.

#### 1.2c.3 Equilibrium of Forces and Moments

In some cases, the equilibrium of forces and moments must be considered simultaneously. This is known as the equilibrium of forces and moments. The equilibrium of forces and moments can be represented as:

$$
\sum F = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \sum M = 0
$$

where $\sum F$ is the sum of all forces acting on the body and $\sum M$ is the sum of all moments acting on the body.

#### 1.2c.4 Applications of Forces and Moments in Statics

The concepts of forces and moments are applied in various fields, including mechanical engineering, civil engineering, and structural analysis. In these fields, engineers often need to analyze the equilibrium of forces and moments to ensure the stability and safety of structures.

For example, in mechanical engineering, the equilibrium of forces and moments is used to design machines and mechanisms. In civil engineering, it is used to design structures such as bridges and buildings. In structural analysis, it is used to analyze the stability of structures under various loading conditions.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of equilibrium of forces and moments in more detail, including how to solve problems involving equilibrium of forces and moments.




#### 1.3a Definition of Equilibrium

Equilibrium is a fundamental concept in mechanics and materials, particularly in the field of statics. It refers to a state in which all forces and moments acting on a body are balanced, resulting in no net force or moment. This state is crucial for the stability and safety of structures, as well as for the proper functioning of machines and mechanisms.

In the context of statics, equilibrium can be defined in terms of forces and moments. The equilibrium of forces is achieved when the sum of all forces acting on a body is equal to zero. Mathematically, this can be represented as:

$$
\sum F = 0
$$

where $\sum F$ is the sum of all forces acting on the body.

Similarly, the equilibrium of moments is achieved when the sum of all moments acting on a body about any point or axis is equal to zero. This can be represented as:

$$
\sum M = 0
$$

where $\sum M$ is the sum of all moments acting on the body.

In some cases, the equilibrium of forces and moments must be considered simultaneously. This is known as the equilibrium of forces and moments. The equilibrium of forces and moments can be represented as:

$$
\sum F = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \sum M = 0
$$

where $\sum F$ is the sum of all forces acting on the body and $\sum M$ is the sum of all moments acting on the body.

The concept of equilibrium is not limited to statics. In dynamics, equilibrium is defined as a state in which the sum of all forces acting on a body is equal to zero, but the sum of all moments may not necessarily be equal to zero. This is represented as:

$$
\sum F = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \sum M \neq 0
$$

In the next section, we will explore the applications of equilibrium in various fields, including mechanical engineering, civil engineering, and structural analysis.

#### 1.3b Types of Equilibrium

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of equilibrium and defined it in terms of forces and moments. In this section, we will delve deeper into the types of equilibrium that can occur in a system.

There are three main types of equilibrium: static, dynamic, and thermal equilibrium. Each type of equilibrium is characterized by different conditions on the forces and moments acting on a system.

##### Static Equilibrium

As we have already discussed, static equilibrium is achieved when the sum of all forces and moments acting on a system is equal to zero. This can be represented as:

$$
\sum F = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \sum M = 0
$$

In static equilibrium, the system is at rest or moving at a constant velocity. This type of equilibrium is crucial for the stability and safety of structures, as well as for the proper functioning of machines and mechanisms.

##### Dynamic Equilibrium

Dynamic equilibrium, on the other hand, is achieved when the sum of all forces acting on a system is equal to zero, but the sum of all moments may not necessarily be equal to zero. This can be represented as:

$$
\sum F = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \sum M \neq 0
$$

In dynamic equilibrium, the system is moving at a constant velocity. This type of equilibrium is common in systems where forces are constantly changing, such as in a moving object.

##### Thermal Equilibrium

Thermal equilibrium is a type of equilibrium that occurs in systems involving heat. It is achieved when the system's temperature is constant, and there is no net heat transfer into or out of the system. This can be represented as:

$$
\sum Q = 0
$$

where $\sum Q$ is the sum of all heat transfer into and out of the system.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of equilibrium in more detail, focusing on the conditions for equilibrium and how to solve equilibrium problems.

#### 1.3c Applications of Equilibrium

In this section, we will explore some practical applications of equilibrium in the field of mechanics and materials. The principles of equilibrium are fundamental to the design and analysis of structures, machines, and mechanisms. They are also crucial in understanding the behavior of deformable bodies under various loading conditions.

##### Structural Analysis

In structural analysis, engineers often need to determine whether a structure is in equilibrium under various loading conditions. This involves checking whether the sum of all forces and moments acting on the structure is equal to zero. If the sum is not equal to zero, the structure is not in equilibrium, and the engineer needs to modify the design to achieve equilibrium.

For example, consider a simple beam under a uniformly distributed load. The beam is in equilibrium when the sum of all forces acting on the beam is equal to zero. This can be represented as:

$$
\sum F = 0
$$

where $\sum F$ is the sum of all forces acting on the beam. This condition ensures that the beam does not experience any net force, which would cause it to move or deform.

##### Machine Design

In machine design, equilibrium is crucial in ensuring that machines operate smoothly and safely. Machines often involve moving parts that are subject to various forces and moments. By applying the principles of equilibrium, engineers can design machines that operate in a stable and predictable manner.

For instance, consider a simple pendulum. The pendulum is in equilibrium when the sum of all forces and moments acting on it is equal to zero. This can be represented as:

$$
\sum F = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \sum M = 0
$$

where $\sum F$ is the sum of all forces acting on the pendulum and $\sum M$ is the sum of all moments acting on the pendulum. This condition ensures that the pendulum does not experience any net force or moment, which would cause it to move or rotate.

##### Deformable Bodies

In the study of deformable bodies, equilibrium is used to analyze the behavior of bodies under various loading conditions. By applying the principles of equilibrium, engineers can predict how a body will deform under different loads and design structures that can withstand these deformations.

For example, consider a beam under a bending moment. The beam is in equilibrium when the sum of all forces and moments acting on the beam is equal to zero. This can be represented as:

$$
\sum F = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \sum M = 0
$$

where $\sum F$ is the sum of all forces acting on the beam and $\sum M$ is the sum of all moments acting on the beam. This condition ensures that the beam does not experience any net force or moment, which would cause it to deform.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of equilibrium and explore how to solve equilibrium problems.
