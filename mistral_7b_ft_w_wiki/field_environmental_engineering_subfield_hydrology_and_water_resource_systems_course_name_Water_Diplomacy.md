#### 2.2a Understanding SDGs

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 global goals adopted by the United Nations in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. These goals provide a framework for addressing the most pressing economic, social, and environmental challenges facing the world today. The SDGs are integrated and indivisible, meaning that they must be implemented together in a balanced and coherent manner.

The SDGs build upon the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were adopted in 2000 and expired in 2015. While the MDGs focused primarily on poverty reduction, the SDGs are more comprehensive and encompass all three dimensions of sustainable development: economic, social, and environmental.

The SDGs are not legally binding, but they provide a common framework for countries to work towards a more sustainable future. They are also accompanied by a set of 169 targets and 232 indicators to measure progress. The SDGs are universal, meaning that they apply to all countries, but they also recognize the unique challenges and circumstances of developing countries.

The SDGs are interlinked and interdependent, meaning that progress in one area can contribute to progress in others. For example, achieving SDG 1 (No Poverty) can contribute to achieving SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), as poverty is often a root cause of food insecurity. Similarly, achieving SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being) can contribute to achieving SDG 4 (Quality Education), as health is a prerequisite for learning.

The SDGs also have a strong focus on leaving no one behind, meaning that they aim to reach the most vulnerable and marginalized populations. This includes women, children, indigenous peoples, and others who may face discrimination or exclusion.

In the context of water resources management, the SDGs provide a framework for addressing the water-related targets and indicators. For example, SDG 6 aims to "ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all" by 2030. This includes targets to reduce the number of people without access to safe drinking water and sanitation, to improve water quality, and to implement integrated water resources management at the basin level.

In the next section, we will explore how the SDGs relate to the principles of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM).

#### 2.2b The Role of SDGs in IWRM

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) play a crucial role in the practice of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). The SDGs provide a framework for addressing the most pressing economic, social, and environmental challenges facing the world today, including those related to water resources.

The SDGs are particularly relevant to IWRM in several ways. First, the SDGs reinforce the principles of IWRM. For example, SDG 6, which aims to "ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all," aligns with the IWRM principle of equity, as it seeks to ensure that all people have access to safe and clean water. Similarly, SDG 14, which aims to "conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development," aligns with the IWRM principle of sustainability, as it seeks to manage water resources in a way that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

Second, the SDGs provide a set of targets and indicators that can guide IWRM efforts. For example, the target under SDG 6 to "by 2030, reduce by half the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation" can serve as a goal for IWRM initiatives. Similarly, the indicators associated with SDG 6, such as the proportion of the population with access to safe drinking water and sanitation, can be used to measure progress in IWRM efforts.

Third, the SDGs promote a holistic and integrated approach to water resources management. This aligns with the IWRM principle of integration, as it recognizes the interlinkages between water, food security, health, and other areas. For example, SDG 2, which aims to "end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture," recognizes the importance of water for food production and security. Similarly, SDG 3, which aims to "ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages," recognizes the importance of water for health and well-being.

Finally, the SDGs promote a participatory and inclusive approach to water resources management. This aligns with the IWRM principle of participation, as it recognizes the importance of involving all stakeholders, including women, in decision-making processes. For example, SDG 5, which aims to "achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls," recognizes the importance of gender equality in water resources management.

In conclusion, the SDGs play a crucial role in IWRM by reinforcing its principles, providing a set of targets and indicators, promoting a holistic and integrated approach, and promoting a participatory and inclusive approach. As such, they provide a valuable framework for managing water resources and resolving conflicts in a sustainable and equitable manner.

#### 2.5a Challenges in Transboundary Water Management

Transboundary water management presents a unique set of challenges that require a comprehensive and collaborative approach. These challenges can be broadly categorized into three areas: legal and regulatory, technical and informational, and socio-economic.

##### Legal and Regulatory Challenges

The legal and regulatory framework for transboundary water management is often incomplete or outdated, as identified by the water community of Argentina during the Second National Water Resources Meeting held in Buenos Aires (May 18–20, 2004). This can lead to a lack of clear guidelines and regulations for managing shared water resources, which can result in conflicts and disputes between countries.

Moreover, the legal and regulatory framework may not adequately address the specific challenges faced by different regions. For example, in Argentina, the Matanza-Riachuelo River Basin in Buenos Aires has been identified as a particular focus for water pollution from industrial effluents. However, the legal and regulatory framework may not provide sufficient incentives or mechanisms for addressing this issue.

##### Technical and Informational Challenges

The technical and informational challenges in transboundary water management are related to the lack of an integrated national water resources information system and deficient water resources monitoring network. This can make it difficult to accurately assess the current state of water resources and identify potential risks and threats.

For instance, in Argentina, the pollution and overuse of the aquifer in Mendoza have become a problem where agriculture and industrial runoff and mismanagement of irrigation water has deteriorated the first levels of the aquifer. This has led to over pumping and exploitation of deeper wells that reach the second and third layers of water. The lack of an integrated information system and deficient monitoring network has made it difficult to track and address this issue.

##### Socio-economic Challenges

The socio-economic challenges in transboundary water management are related to the lack of appropriate incentives for conservation and efficient use of the resource base and for reducing pollution. This can lead to overuse and mismanagement of water resources, which can have serious environmental, economic, and social impacts.

For example, in Argentina, the pollution and overuse of the aquifer in Mendoza have not only led to environmental degradation but also to economic losses for the region. Abandoned wells have resulted in fields becoming stagnant and barren, creating an economic loss for the region.

In conclusion, transboundary water management presents a complex set of challenges that require a comprehensive and collaborative approach. Addressing these challenges will require a combination of legal, technical, and socio-economic measures, as well as strong political will and commitment from all stakeholders involved.
