### Section 1.1 Overview:

Environmental management is a critical field that focuses on the protection and improvement of the environment. It involves the application of various principles, policies, and practices to manage environmental issues. These issues can range from pollution and resource depletion to biodiversity loss and climate change. The goal of environmental management is to find a balance between human needs and the needs of the environment, ensuring a sustainable future for all.

In this section, we will provide an overview of environmental management, including its definition, goals, and features. We will also discuss the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, a model used in environmental management systems. This model provides a systematic approach to managing environmental issues, ensuring continuous improvement and sustainability.

#### 1.1a Definition of Environmental Management

Environmental management can be defined as the process of planning, implementing, and monitoring policies and practices to protect and improve the environment. It involves the integration of environmental considerations into decision-making processes, with the aim of minimizing negative impacts on the environment and maximizing benefits to society.

Environmental management is a multidisciplinary field that draws from various disciplines such as ecology, chemistry, engineering, and social sciences. It is a continuous process that involves planning, organizing, coordinating, and controlling environmental resources for the benefit of society.

#### 1.1b Goals of Environmental Management

The primary goal of environmental management is to ensure the sustainable use of environmental resources. This involves balancing the needs of human society with the needs of the environment. Environmental management aims to minimize the negative impacts of human activities on the environment, while maximizing the benefits of these activities.

Specific goals of environmental management can include:

- Compliance with environmental regulations and standards.
- Reduction of waste and pollution.
- Improvement of environmental quality.
- Sustainable use of natural resources.
- Enhancement of biodiversity.
- Climate change mitigation and adaptation.

#### 1.1c Features of Environmental Management

Environmental management systems (EMS) are designed to help organizations manage their environmental impacts. They are based on the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle, a continuous improvement process that involves:

1. Planning: Defining environmental policy and planning the EMS.
2. Doing: Implementing the EMS.
3. Checking: Monitoring and reviewing the EMS.
4. Acting: Taking action based on the results of the check.

EMS can be accredited under ISO 14001, a standard that provides a framework for organizations to follow, rather than establishing environmental performance requirements. Alternatively, organizations can use the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS), a voluntary environmental management system developed by the European Commission.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle and discuss how it can be applied in environmental management.

#### 1.1b Importance of Environmental Management

Environmental management is of paramount importance for several reasons. Firstly, it helps to ensure the sustainability of our planet. The environment is a finite resource, and if we do not manage it effectively, we risk depleting it for future generations. Environmental management provides a framework for balancing human needs with the needs of the environment, ensuring that we can continue to meet our needs without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs.

Secondly, environmental management helps to protect biodiversity. Biodiversity refers to the variety of living organisms found in an ecosystem. It is crucial for the functioning of ecosystems and provides a wide range of benefits, including food, medicine, and clean air and water. Environmental management can help to protect biodiversity by identifying and managing threats to species and habitats.

Thirdly, environmental management can help to mitigate the impacts of climate change. Climate change is one of the most pressing environmental issues of our time. It is caused by the increase in greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, leading to changes in temperature and weather patterns. Environmental management can help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.

Lastly, environmental management can help to improve public health. Many environmental issues, such as air and water pollution, can have detrimental effects on human health. Environmental management can help to identify and mitigate these risks, improving public health and quality of life.

In conclusion, environmental management is crucial for ensuring the sustainability of our planet, protecting biodiversity, mitigating climate change, and improving public health. It is a complex and multidisciplinary field that requires the integration of various principles, policies, and practices. In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the principles and practices of environmental management, exploring how they can be applied to address environmental issues.

#### 1.1c Challenges in Environmental Management

Environmental management, while crucial for the sustainability of our planet, is not without its challenges. These challenges can be broadly categorized into three areas: technological, economic, and social.

Technological challenges in environmental management often arise from the need to balance environmental protection with economic development. For instance, the transition to renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, is a key part of climate change mitigation. However, the technology for these sources is still developing, and they are not always as reliable or cost-effective as traditional fossil fuel-based energy sources. This can make it difficult to fully transition to renewable energy, particularly in developing countries where the cost of these technologies can be prohibitive.

Another technological challenge is the management of waste. While recycling and other waste management strategies can help to reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills, these strategies are not always feasible or effective. For example, recycling requires significant energy and resources, and not all materials can be recycled. Furthermore, even when recycling is possible, it can be difficult to ensure that waste is properly sorted and processed, leading to a significant amount of waste still ending up in landfills.

##### Economic Challenges

Economic challenges in environmental management often arise from the need to balance environmental protection with economic development. For instance, the transition to renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, can be costly, particularly in developing countries. This can make it difficult to fully transition to renewable energy, particularly in developing countries where the cost of these technologies can be prohibitive.

Another economic challenge is the management of waste. While recycling and other waste management strategies can help to reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills, these strategies can also be costly. For example, recycling requires significant energy and resources, and not all materials can be recycled. Furthermore, even when recycling is possible, it can be difficult to ensure that waste is properly sorted and processed, leading to a significant amount of waste still ending up in landfills.

##### Social Challenges

Social challenges in environmental management often arise from the need to balance environmental protection with social and economic development. For instance, the transition to renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, can be difficult in developing countries where there may be a lack of infrastructure or skills to support these technologies.

Another social challenge is the management of waste. While recycling and other waste management strategies can help to reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills, these strategies can also be difficult to implement in developing countries where there may be a lack of infrastructure or skills to support these strategies.

In conclusion, while environmental management is crucial for the sustainability of our planet, it is also a complex field with a range of challenges that need to be addressed. These challenges require innovative solutions and a multidisciplinary approach, making environmental management a field that requires the collaboration of scientists, engineers, policymakers, and the public.

RTNDA Edward R # Ecosystem-based management

## Implementation

Because ecosystem-based management is applied to large, diverse areas encompassing an array of interactions between species, ecosystem components, and humans, it is often perceived as a complex process that is difficult to implement. Slocombe (1998b) also noted that in addition, uncertainty is common and predictions are difficult. However, in light of significant ecosystem degradation, there is a need for a holistic approach that combines environmental knowledge and co-ordination with governing agencies to initiate, sustain and enforce habitat and species protection, and include public education and involvement. As a result, ecosystem-based management will likely be increasingly used in the future as a form of environmental management. Some suggestions for implementing ecosystem-based management and what the process may involve are as follows:

### Goals and objectives

Defining clear and concise goals for ecosystem-based management is one of the most important steps in effective ecosystem-based management implementation. Goals must move beyond science-based or science-defined objectives to include social, cultural, economic and environmental importance. Of equal importance is to make sure that the community and stake-holders are involved throughout the entire process. Slocombe (1998a) also stated that a single, end-all goal cannot be the solution, but instead a combination of goals and their relationships with each other should be the focus.

As discussed by Slocombe (1998a), goals should be broadly applicable, measurable and readily observable, and ideally be collectively supported in order to be achievable. The idea is to provide direction for both thinking and action and should try to minimize managing ecosystems in a static state. Goals should also be flexible enough to incorporate a measure of uncertainty and be able to evolve as conditions and knowledge change.

### Section: 1.2 Environmental Legislation:

Environmental legislation plays a crucial role in the field of environmental management. It provides the legal framework for protecting the environment and regulating human interaction with it. This section will provide an overview of environmental laws, including their history, key principles, and current challenges.

#### 1.2a Overview of Environmental Laws

Environmental laws are a collection of laws, regulations, agreements, and common law that govern how humans interact with the environment. They are designed to protect the environment from harm caused by human activity, either directly or indirectly. This includes laws governing the management of natural resources such as forests, minerals, and fisheries, as well as regulations related to environmental impact assessments.

The history of environmental law dates back to ancient civilizations, where early examples of laws designed to preserve the environment for its own sake or for human enjoyment can be found. However, it was not until the 19th and 20th centuries that environmental law became a distinct legal discipline.

One of the earliest examples of environmental legislation in the United States was the Metropolitan Commission of Sewers Act 1848, which was passed in response to the "Great Stink" of 1858. This Act allowed the Metropolitan Commission for Sewers to close cesspits around the city in an attempt to "clean up" but this led to the pollution of the River Thames. This incident highlights the importance of effective environmental legislation and the need for a balance between human needs and the environment.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the United States saw a rapid increase in environmental legislation. The Clean Air Act of 1956, for example, was passed in response to the "Great Smog" of 1952, which led to the deaths of thousands of people in London. This Act established national air quality standards and provided the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with the authority to regulate air pollution.

Today, environmental legislation continues to evolve and adapt to new environmental challenges. The Clean Power Plan, for example, is a recent initiative by the EPA to reduce carbon emissions from power plants. This initiative is a response to the growing concern over climate change and its impact on the environment.

Despite the progress made in environmental legislation, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed. One of the main challenges is the lack of enforcement and accountability. Many environmental laws are not adequately enforced, and there is often a lack of accountability for environmental crimes. This allows for continued exploitation of the environment and puts it at risk.

Another challenge is the complexity of environmental legislation. With the increasing number of laws and regulations, it can be difficult for individuals and organizations to understand and comply with them. This can lead to confusion and non-compliance, which can have serious consequences for the environment.

In conclusion, environmental legislation plays a crucial role in protecting the environment and regulating human interaction with it. While there have been significant advancements in this field, there are still many challenges that need to be addressed in order to ensure the long-term health and sustainability of our planet.

### Section: 1.3 Environmental Management Systems:

Environmental management systems (EMS) are a crucial component of environmental management. They provide a structured approach to managing environmental aspects and impacts, and are essential for organizations seeking to comply with environmental legislation and regulations. In this section, we will explore the definition of EMS, its key components, and the benefits it offers.

#### 1.3a Definition of Environmental Management Systems

An environmental management system (EMS) is a systematic approach to managing environmental aspects and impacts. It integrates policy, procedures, and processes for training of personnel, monitoring, summarizing, and reporting of specialized environmental performance information to internal and external stakeholders of a firm. The most widely used standard on which an EMS is based is International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001. Alternatives include the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS).

The primary goal of an EMS is to increase compliance and reduce waste. This is achieved through a continuous improvement process that involves planning, implementing, checking, and acting. The Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle is a common model used in EMS, which emphasizes the importance of continuous improvement.

An EMS follows a Plan-Do-Check-Act, or PDCA, Cycle. The diagram shows the process of first developing an environmental policy, planning the EMS, and then implementing it. The process also includes checking the system and acting on it. The model is continuous because an EMS is a process of continual improvement in which an organization is constantly reviewing and revising the system.

#### 1.3b Key Components of Environmental Management Systems

An EMS consists of several key components that work together to manage environmental aspects and impacts. These include:

- Environmental Policy: This is a statement of an organization's commitment to environmental management. It outlines the organization's goals, objectives, and strategies for managing environmental aspects and impacts.

- Planning: This involves identifying environmental aspects and impacts, setting environmental objectives and targets, and planning how to achieve them.

- Implementation and Operation: This involves implementing the EMS, including training personnel, monitoring and measuring environmental performance, and taking corrective and preventive actions.

- Checking and Corrective Action: This involves reviewing the EMS to ensure it is working effectively and taking corrective action when necessary.

- Management Review: This involves reviewing the EMS at regular intervals to ensure it is meeting its objectives and making necessary revisions.

#### 1.3c Benefits of Environmental Management Systems

Implementing an EMS offers numerous benefits to organizations. These include:

- Compliance with environmental legislation and regulations: An EMS helps organizations comply with environmental laws and regulations, reducing the risk of penalties and fines.

- Improved environmental performance: By systematically managing environmental aspects and impacts, organizations can reduce their environmental footprint and improve their environmental performance.

- Cost savings: An EMS can lead to cost savings through more efficient use of resources and reduced waste.

- Enhanced reputation: By demonstrating a commitment to environmental management, organizations can enhance their reputation and build trust with stakeholders.

In conclusion, environmental management systems are a crucial tool for organizations seeking to manage their environmental impacts effectively. By following a structured approach and continuously improving their systems, organizations can achieve compliance, reduce waste, and enhance their reputation.

#### 1.3b Components of Environmental Management Systems

An environmental management system (EMS) is a comprehensive system that integrates various components to manage environmental aspects and impacts. These components work together to ensure that an organization is able to effectively manage its environmental performance. The following are the key components of an EMS:

1. Environmental Policy: The environmental policy is the foundation of an EMS. It outlines the organization's commitment to environmental management and sets the direction for all other components of the EMS. The policy should be communicated to all employees and stakeholders and should be regularly reviewed and updated.

2. Planning: The planning component involves identifying environmental aspects and impacts, setting environmental objectives and targets, and planning how to achieve them. This includes conducting environmental impact assessments, identifying key environmental issues, and developing strategies to address them.

3. Implementation and Operation: Once the planning component is complete, the implementation and operation component comes into play. This involves putting the plans into action and operating the EMS on a day-to-day basis. This includes training employees, implementing procedures and processes, and monitoring and measuring environmental performance.

#### 1.3c Implementation of Environmental Management Systems

The implementation of an environmental management system (EMS) is a crucial step in the process of environmental management. It involves the actual application of the EMS components discussed in the previous section. This section will explore the key steps involved in implementing an EMS.

1. Establishing an Environmental Management Program (EMP): The first step in implementing an EMS is to establish an EMP. This program outlines the organization's environmental management strategy and provides a framework for implementing the EMS. The EMP should align with the organization's environmental policy and objectives, and should be communicated to all employees and stakeholders.

2. Identifying Environmental Aspects and Impacts: The next step is to identify the environmental aspects and impacts of the organization's activities, products, and services. This involves conducting a thorough environmental impact assessment to understand the potential environmental impacts of the organization's operations.

3. Setting Environmental Objectives and Targets: Once the environmental aspects and impacts have been identified, the organization can set environmental objectives and targets. These should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) to ensure effective management.

4. Implementing Environmental Management Procedures: The organization should then implement environmental management procedures to achieve its environmental objectives and targets. These procedures should be integrated into the organization's existing management systems and processes.

5. Training Employees: Employee training is a crucial aspect of implementing an EMS. All employees should be trained on the organization's environmental policy, EMP, and environmental management procedures. This ensures that everyone is aware of their role in environmental management and can contribute to the success of the EMS.

6. Monitoring and Measuring Environmental Performance: The organization should establish a system for monitoring and measuring its environmental performance. This involves collecting and analyzing data on environmental aspects and impacts, as well as tracking progress towards environmental objectives and targets.

7. Reviewing and Updating the EMS: The EMS should be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure its effectiveness. This involves conducting audits, identifying areas for improvement, and making necessary revisions to the EMS.

By following these steps, an organization can effectively implement an EMS and manage its environmental aspects and impacts. This not only helps to comply with environmental legislation and regulations, but also contributes to the organization's overall sustainability and corporate responsibility. 





### Section: 1.3 Environmental Management Systems:

Environmental management systems (EMS) are a crucial component of environmental management. They provide a structured approach to managing environmental aspects and impacts, and are essential for organizations seeking to comply with environmental legislation and regulations. In this section, we will explore the definition of EMS, its key components, and the benefits it offers.

#### 1.3a Definition of Environmental Management Systems

An environmental management system (EMS) is a systematic approach to managing environmental aspects and impacts. It integrates policy, procedures, and processes for training of personnel, monitoring, summarizing, and reporting of specialized environmental performance information to internal and external stakeholders of a firm. The most widely used standard on which an EMS is based is International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14001. Alternatives include the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS).

The primary goal of an EMS is to increase compliance and reduce waste. This is achieved through a continuous improvement process that involves planning, implementing, checking, and acting. The Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle is a common model used in EMS, which emphasizes the importance of continuous improvement.

An EMS follows a Plan-Do-Check-Act, or PDCA, Cycle. The diagram shows the process of first developing an environmental policy, planning the EMS, and then implementing it. The process also includes checking the system and acting on it. The model is continuous because an EMS is a process of continual improvement in which an organization is constantly reviewing and revising the system.

#### 1.3b Key Components of Environmental Management Systems

An EMS consists of several key components that work together to manage environmental aspects and impacts. These include:

- Environmental Policy: This is a statement of an organization's commitment to environmental management. It outlines the organization's goals, objectives, and strategies for managing environmental aspects and impacts. The policy is communicated to all employees and is reviewed and updated regularly.

- Planning: This involves identifying environmental aspects and impacts, setting targets and objectives, and planning actions to achieve them. The planning process includes risk assessment and impact assessment.

- Implementation and Operation: This involves putting the EMS into action. It includes training employees, implementing procedures and processes, and monitoring and measuring environmental performance.

- Checking and Corrective Action: This involves reviewing the EMS to ensure it is working effectively. It includes audits, inspections, and corrective action when necessary.

- Management Review: This involves reviewing the EMS to ensure it is meeting its objectives and making necessary revisions. It also involves reporting environmental performance to management and stakeholders.

#### 1.3c Case Studies in Environmental Management Systems

To further illustrate the benefits and effectiveness of EMS, let's look at some case studies.

##### Case Study 1: ISO 14001 Certification at Toyota Motor Corporation

Toyota Motor Corporation, a leading automobile manufacturer, implemented an EMS based on ISO 14001 in 1992. The company's EMS includes a comprehensive environmental policy, planning and implementation of environmental management activities, and continuous improvement. As a result of their EMS, Toyota has reduced waste and emissions, improved energy efficiency, and achieved ISO 14001 certification at all of its production sites.

##### Case Study 2: EMAS Implementation at the European Commission

The European Commission, a major public institution, implemented an EMS based on EMAS in 2001. The EMS includes an environmental policy, planning and implementation of environmental management activities, and continuous improvement. The EMS has helped the Commission reduce its environmental impact and achieve compliance with environmental legislation and regulations.

##### Case Study 3: Brownfield Redevelopment at the Port of Bellingham

The Port of Bellingham, Washington, USA, implemented an EMS to manage the environmental aspects and impacts of redeveloping a brownfield site. The EMS included an environmental policy, planning and implementation of environmental management activities, and continuous improvement. The EMS helped the Port successfully redevelop the site, creating a new waterfront park and marina.

These case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of EMS in managing environmental aspects and impacts, achieving compliance with environmental legislation and regulations, and improving environmental performance. They also highlight the importance of continuous improvement in EMS.




#### 1.3c Implementation of Environmental Management Systems

Implementing an EMS can be a complex and challenging process, especially for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). However, with proper planning and support, it can be a valuable tool for improving environmental performance and achieving cost savings.

##### 1.3c.1 Cost Savings

One of the main incentives for implementing an EMS is the potential for cost savings. A pan-EU survey of businesses using EMAS identified that cost-savings were indeed the biggest perceived benefit to arise from implementation across enterprises in Europe. However, SMEs placed this second, claiming that EMAS mainly benefited corporate image.

Implementing an EMS can lead to cost savings in several ways. For instance, by identifying and managing environmental aspects and impacts, organizations can reduce waste and resource consumption, leading to cost savings. Additionally, the process of implementing an EMS can also lead to efficiency improvements, further reducing costs.

##### 1.3c.2 Challenges for SMEs

Despite the potential benefits, the implementation of EMS can be challenging for SMEs. The requirements of EMS, such as the need for an environmental policy, environmental aspects register, and annual objectives and targets, can be difficult to understand and implement without support or training.

Moreover, the certification and validation process can be expensive and may require support from consultants, adding to the costs of implementation. These financial burdens may have minimal impact on larger corporations, but for smaller firms, the costs of implementation and upkeep may outweigh the cost savings achievable.

##### 1.3c.3 Support and Training

To overcome these challenges, SMEs may require support and training in implementing an EMS. This can be provided by environmental consultants or through training programs. Additionally, government agencies and industry associations can also provide guidance and resources to help SMEs implement EMS.

In conclusion, while the implementation of EMS can be challenging for SMEs, with proper support and training, it can be a valuable tool for improving environmental performance and achieving cost savings.

In this chapter, we will delve into the process of brownfield redevelopment, exploring the various steps involved, from initial assessment and planning to remediation and redevelopment. We will also discuss the legal and regulatory frameworks governing brownfield redevelopment, as well as the role of stakeholders, including local communities, in the process.

The chapter will also touch on the environmental, health, and economic impacts of brownfield redevelopment, providing a comprehensive understanding of the benefits and challenges associated with this practice. We will also explore case studies of successful brownfield redevelopment projects, highlighting best practices and lessons learned.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a solid understanding of brownfield redevelopment, its importance in environmental management, and the key considerations and challenges involved in the process. This knowledge will be invaluable for anyone involved in environmental management, from students and researchers to practitioners and policymakers.




#### 2.1a Definition of Brownfield

Brownfield, as a term, is a broad one that encompasses a variety of sites. The Federal Government of Canada defines brownfields as "abandoned, idle or underutilized commercial or industrial properties [typically located in urban areas] where past actions have caused environmental contamination, but which still have potential for redevelopment or other economic opportunities." This definition highlights the potential for redevelopment and the presence of environmental contamination.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) defines brownfield more broadly, including not just sites with potential for redevelopment, but also those with impediments such as the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant. This definition aligns with the general definition of the term, which scopes to "industrial or commercial property".

The term "brownfields" first appeared in the 1990s, reflecting the shift in focus from cleaning up hazardous waste sites to redeveloping abandoned industrial and commercial properties. The term is often used interchangeably with other terms such as "contaminated sites", "abandoned sites", and "underutilized sites".

Brownfields can be categorized into two main types: post-industrial brownfields and post-mining brownfields. Post-industrial brownfields are abandoned or underutilized due to pollution from industrial use, while post-mining brownfields are abandoned or underutilized due to pollution from mining activities.

Examples of post-industrial brownfield sites include abandoned factories, dry cleaning establishments, gas stations, etc. Typical contaminants include hydrocarbon spillages, solvents and pesticides, as well as heavy metals like lead, asbestos, petroleum, etc.

Many contaminated post-industrial brownfield sites sit unused because the cleaning costs may be more than the land is worth after redevelopment. Previously unknown underground wastes can increase the cost for study and clean-up. Depending on the contaminants and damage present, adaptive re-use and disposal of a brownfield can require advanced and specialized appraisal analysis techniques.

In the next section, we will delve into the process of brownfield redevelopment, exploring the various steps involved, from initial assessment and planning to remediation and redevelopment.

#### 2.1b Overview of Brownfield Redevelopment

Brownfield redevelopment is a critical aspect of environmental management, particularly in urban areas where industrial activities have left behind a legacy of contaminated sites. The process involves the assessment, cleanup, and redevelopment of these sites, with the aim of transforming them into productive and safe spaces for community use.

The process of brownfield redevelopment can be broadly categorized into three main stages: assessment, cleanup, and redevelopment. 

##### Assessment

The first stage of brownfield redevelopment is the assessment of the site. This involves a thorough investigation of the site to determine the extent of contamination, the types of contaminants present, and the potential risks they pose to human health and the environment. This stage is crucial as it provides the necessary information for planning and decision-making in the subsequent stages.

##### Cleanup

Once the site has been assessed, the next stage is the cleanup. This involves the removal or treatment of the contaminants to reduce them to safe levels. The cleanup process can be complex and may involve a variety of techniques, depending on the type and extent of contamination. For instance, hydrocarbon spillages may be cleaned up using soil vapor extraction, while heavy metals may be removed through excavation and disposal.

##### Redevelopment

The final stage of brownfield redevelopment is the redevelopment of the site. This involves the transformation of the site into a productive and safe space for community use. The redevelopment can take various forms, depending on the site's location, the types of contaminants present, and the community's needs. For instance, a brownfield site in an urban area might be redeveloped into a residential or commercial area, while a brownfield site in a rural area might be redeveloped into a park or a farm.

Brownfield redevelopment is a complex and multifaceted process that requires the involvement of a variety of stakeholders, including government agencies, private developers, and community members. It also requires the application of a variety of disciplines, including environmental science, engineering, economics, and law. Despite its complexity, brownfield redevelopment offers significant potential benefits, including the revitalization of abandoned or underutilized spaces, the creation of new economic opportunities, and the improvement of environmental and public health.

#### 2.1c Case Studies in Brownfield Redevelopment

In this section, we will explore some case studies of brownfield redevelopment to provide a practical understanding of the concepts discussed in the previous sections. These case studies will illustrate the challenges faced in brownfield redevelopment, the strategies used to overcome these challenges, and the benefits of successful redevelopment.

##### Case Study 1: The High Line, New York City

The High Line is a 1.45-mile-long elevated linear park built on a former freight rail line in New York City. The site was abandoned for over 20 years and was at risk of being demolished due to its deteriorating condition. However, a community-led effort to preserve and redevelop the site resulted in its transformation into a popular public space.

The redevelopment process involved a thorough assessment of the site, which revealed significant contamination from industrial activities. The cleanup process involved the removal of contaminated soil and the treatment of groundwater. The redevelopment of the site into a park required extensive planning and design work, as well as the construction of new infrastructure, such as walkways and seating areas.

The High Line project has been widely recognized for its successful brownfield redevelopment, demonstrating the potential for brownfield sites to be transformed into valuable community assets.

#### 2.1b Importance of Brownfield Redevelopment

Brownfield redevelopment is a critical aspect of environmental management. It involves the transformation of abandoned or underutilized properties into productive land. This process is important for several reasons.

Firstly, brownfield redevelopment can help to revitalize communities. Many brownfields are located in urban areas, and their redevelopment can lead to the creation of new jobs, increased property values, and improved quality of life for residents. For instance, the redevelopment of the former Bethlehem Steel site in Lackawanna, New York, has led to the creation of over 1,000 jobs and has generated millions of dollars in tax revenue.

Secondly, brownfield redevelopment can help to reduce environmental hazards. Many brownfields are contaminated with hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. By cleaning up these sites, we can reduce the risk of exposure to these hazards for both humans and the environment. This can help to protect public health and the ecosystem.

Thirdly, brownfield redevelopment can help to conserve open space. Many brownfields are located in areas that are already built up, and their redevelopment can help to prevent the need for new development on undeveloped land. This can help to preserve natural habitats and open spaces, which are important for biodiversity and quality of life.

Finally, brownfield redevelopment can help to reduce the cost of new development. The cost of cleaning up brownfields can be high, but it is often less than the cost of developing new land. By redeveloping brownfields, we can save on the cost of new infrastructure, such as roads and utilities, and on the cost of acquiring new land.

In conclusion, brownfield redevelopment is a crucial aspect of environmental management. It can help to revitalize communities, reduce environmental hazards, conserve open space, and reduce the cost of new development. By promoting brownfield redevelopment, we can create a more sustainable and prosperous future.

#### 2.1c Challenges in Brownfield Redevelopment

Despite the numerous benefits of brownfield redevelopment, there are several challenges that can hinder the process. These challenges can be broadly categorized into three areas: financial, legal, and technical.

##### Financial Challenges

The cost of cleaning up brownfields can be a significant barrier to redevelopment. The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act provides funds from the Federal Government to help in the cost of cleaning, but these funds may not be sufficient to cover all the costs. Furthermore, the cost of cleanup can be uncertain due to the potential for unknown underground wastes and the need for remediation technologies that are still being developed. This uncertainty can make it difficult for developers to plan and finance brownfield redevelopment projects.

##### Legal Challenges

Liability issues are another major challenge in brownfield redevelopment. Developers must consider the potential for future remediation efforts and the risk of liability for these efforts. This risk can be mitigated through various strategies, such as obtaining environmental insurance or entering into contracts with environmental consultants. However, these strategies can add to the cost and complexity of brownfield redevelopment.

##### Technical Challenges

The technical challenges of brownfield redevelopment involve the complexity of the cleanup process. Brownfields often contain a variety of contaminants, and the cleanup process can involve multiple stages and technologies. For example, the cleanup of the former Bethlehem Steel site in Lackawanna, New York, involved the removal of 1.5 million cubic yards of contaminated soil and sediment, the treatment of groundwater, and the capping of hazardous waste landfills. This complexity can make it difficult to plan and execute a cleanup strategy, and it can also increase the risk of unforeseen complications.

Despite these challenges, brownfield redevelopment remains a critical aspect of environmental management. By addressing these challenges and leveraging available resources and technologies, we can continue to transform brownfields into productive land and contribute to the revitalization of our communities.




#### 2.1c Challenges in Brownfield Redevelopment

Brownfield redevelopment, while offering numerous benefits, is not without its challenges. These challenges can be broadly categorized into three areas: technical, financial, and social.

This is a crucial step in the process of brownfield redevelopment as it provides the necessary information to determine the extent of contamination and the appropriate remediation strategies. 

The site assessment is typically conducted in two phases: Phase I and Phase II. The Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) is a non-intrusive investigation that involves a review of existing records and site inspections. It is usually the first step in the process of environmental due diligence. The Phase II ESA, on the other hand, is an intrusive investigation that involves the collection and analysis of soil, groundwater, or building material samples to determine the presence and concentration of various contaminants.

The Phase I ESA is based on the standards promulgated by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). It is designed to identify potential or existing environmental contamination liabilities that may affect the value of the property or pose a risk to human health and the environment. 

The Phase II ESA, on the other hand, is conducted when the Phase I ESA determines a likelihood of site contamination. It involves a more detailed investigation and chemical analysis for hazardous substances and/or petroleum hydrocarbons. The most frequent substances tested are petroleum hydrocarbons, heavy metals, pesticides, solvents, asbestos, and mold.

The purpose of the site assessment is not only to identify the presence of contamination but also to delineate the physical extent of contamination. This information is crucial for the development of a remediation plan that is effective and cost-efficient. 

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the process of site assessment, discussing the various methods and techniques used in Phase I and Phase II ESAs. We will also explore the role of various stakeholders, including government agencies, environmental consultants, and community members, in the process.

#### 3.2a Overview of Remediation Techniques

Remediation techniques are essential for the cleanup of contaminated sites. These techniques are used to remove, neutralize, or contain contaminants in the soil, groundwater, or air. The choice of remediation technique depends on the type and extent of contamination, the site conditions, and the remediation objectives.

##### Physical Remediation Techniques

Physical remediation techniques involve the removal of contaminated soil or groundwater. These techniques are often used when the contamination is localized and the soil or groundwater can be removed without causing significant disturbance to the surrounding environment.

One common physical remediation technique is soil vapor extraction, which involves the removal of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from the soil. This is achieved by injecting air or steam into the soil, which causes the VOCs to vaporize. The vapor is then extracted and treated to remove the contaminants.

Another physical remediation technique is pump and treat, which involves the removal of groundwater contamination through a pumping system. The extracted groundwater is treated to remove the contaminants and then either discharged or re-injected into the ground.

##### Chemical Remediation Techniques

Chemical remediation techniques involve the use of chemical reactions to remove or neutralize contaminants. These techniques are often used when the contamination is widespread and cannot be easily removed.

One common chemical remediation technique is chemical precipitation, which involves the addition of chemicals to the groundwater that react with the contaminants to form insoluble precipitates. These precipitates can then be removed by filtration or sedimentation.

Another chemical remediation technique is aqueous chemical oxidation, which involves the use of oxidizing agents to break down contaminants into less harmful substances. This technique is often used for the remediation of chlorinated solvents and other persistent organic pollutants.

##### Biological Remediation Techniques

Biological remediation techniques involve the use of microorganisms to degrade contaminants. These techniques are often used when the contamination is organic and can be degraded by microorganisms.

One common biological remediation technique is bioremediation, which involves the addition of nutrients and oxygen to stimulate the growth of microorganisms that can degrade the contaminants. This technique is often used for the remediation of petroleum hydrocarbons and other hydrocarbons.

Another biological remediation technique is phytoremediation, which involves the use of plants to remove contaminants from the soil. This technique is often used for the remediation of heavy metals and other inorganic contaminants.

The site assessment process involves a comprehensive investigation of the site, including a review of historical records, a physical inspection, and the collection of soil and groundwater samples. This process helps to identify the presence of contaminants and their potential impact on human health and the environment. The remediation techniques, on the other hand, are designed to remove, neutralize, or contain the contaminants, thereby mitigating the risk to human health and the environment.

The success of brownfield redevelopment largely depends on the effective implementation of these two steps. A thorough site assessment provides the necessary information for the development of a robust remediation plan. Similarly, the appropriate application of remediation techniques can significantly reduce the risk associated with brownfield sites.

In conclusion, site assessment and remediation are integral components of brownfield redevelopment. They are crucial for ensuring the successful transformation of these sites into productive and safe spaces for human habitation and economic activity.

## Chapter 4: Risk Assessment and Management:

### Introduction

Welcome to Chapter 4 of "Environmental Management Practicum: Brownfield Redevelopment". In this chapter, we will be discussing the crucial topic of risk assessment and management. This is a critical aspect of environmental management, especially when dealing with brownfield redevelopment. 

Brownfields are abandoned or underused industrial and commercial facilities available for re-use. These sites are often contaminated with hazardous substances, pollutants, or other contaminants. The redevelopment of these sites can be a complex and challenging process due to the potential risks associated with the contamination. Therefore, understanding and managing these risks is essential for successful brownfield redevelopment.

In this chapter, we will explore the various aspects of risk assessment and management, including the identification of potential risks, the assessment of these risks, and the development of strategies to manage and mitigate these risks. We will also discuss the role of risk assessment and management in the overall process of brownfield redevelopment.

As we delve into this topic, it is important to remember that risk assessment and management is not just about identifying and mitigating potential hazards. It is also about making informed decisions that balance the potential risks against the potential benefits of redevelopment. This requires a comprehensive understanding of the site, its history, and the potential impacts of redevelopment.

We hope that this chapter will provide you with a solid foundation in risk assessment and management, and equip you with the tools and knowledge to effectively manage the risks associated with brownfield redevelopment. Let's get started!




### Section: 4.1 Risk Assessment:

#### 4.1a Definition of Risk Assessment

Risk assessment is a systematic process that involves identifying potential hazards, evaluating the associated risks, and determining the appropriate actions to manage these risks. It is a critical component of environmental management, particularly in the context of brownfield redevelopment. 

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, risk assessment involves identifying potential hazards associated with the redevelopment of a brownfield site. These hazards could be in the form of contaminants such as heavy metals, hydrocarbons, or other pollutants that may be present in the soil, groundwater, or structures on the site. 

The risk assessment process also involves evaluating the potential consequences of these hazards. This includes considering the potential impacts on human health, the environment, and the surrounding community. 

The probability of these hazards occurring is also a key factor in risk assessment. This involves considering the likelihood of exposure to the hazards, the potential severity of the exposure, and the potential for the hazards to cause harm.

The risk assessment process also involves considering the tolerability or acceptability of the risk. This involves balancing the potential risks against the potential benefits of redevelopment. It is important to note that risk assessment is not just about identifying and mitigating potential hazards. It is also about making informed decisions that balance the potential risks against the potential benefits of redevelopment.

Finally, risk assessment involves developing strategies to manage and mitigate the identified risks. This could involve implementing safety measures, conducting remediation activities, or developing contingency plans for potential accidents or emergencies.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the process of risk assessment, discussing the various steps involved and the tools and techniques used to conduct a risk assessment.

#### 4.1b Steps in Risk Assessment

The risk assessment process is a systematic approach that involves several steps. These steps are not always linear and may involve iterations and revisions as more information becomes available. The following are the key steps in the risk assessment process:

1. **Hazard Identification:** This is the first step in the risk assessment process. It involves identifying potential hazards that may be present on the brownfield site. These hazards could be in the form of contaminants such as heavy metals, hydrocarbons, or other pollutants that may be present in the soil, groundwater, or structures on the site. 

2. **Exposure Assessment:** Once the hazards have been identified, the next step is to assess the exposure to these hazards. This involves determining the extent and duration of exposure, the routes of exposure (e.g., inhalation, ingestion, dermal contact), and the population or ecosystem that is exposed.

3. **Dose-Response Assessment:** This step involves determining the relationship between the dose of a contaminant and the response it produces in a population or ecosystem. This is often the most challenging part of the risk assessment process, as it requires a deep understanding of the toxicological properties of the contaminants and the variability in the response among individuals or ecosystems.

4. **Risk Characterization:** The final step in the risk assessment process is risk characterization. This involves integrating the information from the previous steps to estimate the probability and severity of adverse health effects or environmental impacts. This step also involves considering the uncertainties in the risk assessment and determining the confidence in the risk estimates.

These steps provide a systematic approach to risk assessment, but it is important to note that risk assessment is not a one-time activity. It is an ongoing process that should be revisited as new information becomes available or as conditions change. 

In the next section, we will discuss the tools and techniques used in each of these steps.

#### 4.1c Tools and Techniques for Risk Assessment

Risk assessment is a complex process that requires a variety of tools and techniques. These tools and techniques are used to gather and analyze data, estimate risks, and make decisions about risk management. In this section, we will discuss some of the commonly used tools and techniques for risk assessment.

1. **Geographic Information Systems (GIS):** GIS is a powerful tool for risk assessment. It allows for the visualization and analysis of spatial data, making it ideal for assessing risks associated with geographically distributed hazards. GIS can be used to map and analyze data related to hazards, exposures, and impacts, providing a comprehensive view of the risk landscape.

2. **Remote Sensing:** Remote sensing is another important tool for risk assessment. It involves the use of satellite or airborne sensors to collect data about the environment. This data can be used to identify and monitor hazards, assess exposures, and estimate impacts. For example, remote sensing can be used to detect contamination in soil or groundwater, monitor changes in land use, or assess the health of ecosystems.

3. **Statistical Analysis:** Statistical analysis is used to analyze data and estimate risks. This can involve calculating exposure metrics, estimating dose-response relationships, and conducting risk characterization. Statistical methods can also be used to account for uncertainties and variability in the data.

4. **Modeling:** Modeling is used to simulate and predict the behavior of systems or processes. In risk assessment, modeling can be used to simulate the spread of contaminants, the impact of remediation efforts, or the effects of exposure on health or ecosystems. Models can help to inform decision-making by providing insights into potential outcomes and the effects of different management strategies.

5. **Public Participation:** Public participation is a crucial tool for risk assessment. It involves engaging the public in the risk assessment process, providing them with information about the risks, and soliciting their input and feedback. Public participation can help to ensure that risk assessments are transparent and account for the concerns and values of the affected community.

These tools and techniques are not mutually exclusive and can be used in combination to conduct a comprehensive risk assessment. The choice of tools and techniques will depend on the specific characteristics of the risk, the available data, and the objectives of the risk assessment.

#### 4.2a Definition of Risk Management

Risk management is a systematic process that involves identifying, assessing, and controlling risks to minimize, monitor, and control the probability or impact of unfortunate events. It is a crucial aspect of environmental management, particularly in the context of brownfield redevelopment. 

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, risk management involves identifying potential risks associated with the redevelopment process, assessing these risks, and implementing strategies to mitigate or eliminate them. This process is iterative and should be revisited as new information becomes available or as conditions change.

Risk management is not just about avoiding negative outcomes, but also about creating positive outcomes. It is about making informed decisions that balance the potential risks against the potential benefits of redevelopment. This requires a deep understanding of the risks, the potential impacts of these risks, and the effectiveness of potential risk management strategies.

Risk management is not a one-time activity, but an ongoing process that should be integrated into the overall project management process. It should be part of the planning, design, construction, and operation of brownfield redevelopment projects.

Risk management is not just about managing risks, but also about learning from experience. It involves capturing and sharing lessons learned from previous projects, and using these lessons to improve future projects.

Risk management is not just about managing risks, but also about managing uncertainties. It involves identifying and managing uncertainties about the risks, the potential impacts of these risks, and the effectiveness of potential risk management strategies.

Risk management is not just about managing risks, but also about managing the perceptions of risk. It involves understanding and addressing the concerns and perceptions of stakeholders about the risks, the potential impacts of these risks, and the effectiveness of potential risk management strategies.

In the next sections, we will delve deeper into the process of risk management, discussing the key steps involved, the tools and techniques used, and the challenges faced in managing risks in brownfield redevelopment.

#### 4.2b Steps in Risk Management

Risk management is a systematic process that involves several steps. These steps are not always linear and may involve iterations and revisions as new information becomes available or as conditions change. The following are the key steps in the risk management process:

1. **Risk Identification:** This is the first step in the risk management process. It involves identifying potential risks that could affect the brownfield redevelopment project. These risks could be related to the site conditions, the redevelopment process, the stakeholders, or the external environment. The risk identification process should be comprehensive and should involve all relevant stakeholders.

2. **Risk Assessment:** Once the risks have been identified, the next step is to assess these risks. This involves determining the likelihood of each risk occurring and the potential impact it could have on the project. The risk assessment process should be based on a thorough understanding of the project, the site, and the environment. It should also involve the use of appropriate tools and techniques, such as risk matrices, risk registers, and risk impact and likelihood assessments.

3. **Risk Evaluation:** The risk evaluation step involves comparing the assessed risks against the project's risk criteria. This helps to determine whether the risks are acceptable or whether they need to be treated. The risk evaluation process should be transparent and should involve the project's decision-makers.

4. **Risk Treatment:** The risk treatment step involves selecting and implementing strategies to manage the identified risks. These strategies could involve avoiding the risk, mitigating the risk, transferring the risk, or accepting the risk. The risk treatment process should be based on the risk evaluation results and should be documented in a risk treatment plan.

5. **Monitoring and Review:** The final step in the risk management process is monitoring and review. This involves tracking the identified risks, monitoring the implementation of the risk treatment strategies, and reviewing the effectiveness of these strategies. The monitoring and review process should be ongoing and should involve regular reviews and audits.

These steps provide a systematic approach to managing risks in brownfield redevelopment projects. However, it is important to note that risk management is not a one-time activity. It should be an ongoing process that is integrated into the project's management system. It should also be flexible and adaptable to changes in the project, the environment, and the stakeholders.

#### 4.2c Tools and Techniques for Risk Management

Risk management is a complex process that requires the use of various tools and techniques. These tools and techniques help in identifying, assessing, and managing risks. They provide a structured approach to risk management and ensure that all aspects of risk are considered. In this section, we will discuss some of the commonly used tools and techniques for risk management in brownfield redevelopment.

1. **Risk Register:** A risk register is a document that lists all the identified risks in a project. It includes a description of the risk, its potential impact, and the likelihood of its occurrence. The risk register is a crucial tool in risk management as it provides a central repository for all the identified risks. It helps in tracking the risks, monitoring their status, and reviewing their effectiveness.

2. **Risk Impact and Likelihood Assessment (RILA):** RILA is a technique used to assess the potential impact and likelihood of risks. It involves assigning a numerical value to each risk based on its potential impact and likelihood of occurrence. The RILA results are then used to prioritize the risks and determine the resources needed to manage them.

3. **Risk Matrix:** A risk matrix is a visual tool used to represent the risks in a project. It plots the potential impact of the risks against their likelihood of occurrence. The risks are then categorized based on their position in the matrix. This helps in identifying the high-impact, high-likelihood risks that require immediate attention.

4. **Risk Treatment Plan:** A risk treatment plan outlines the strategies used to manage the identified risks. It includes a description of the risk, the selected risk treatment strategy, and the resources needed to implement the strategy. The risk treatment plan is a crucial document in risk management as it provides a detailed plan for managing the risks.

5. **Risk Monitoring and Review:** Risk monitoring and review involve tracking the identified risks, monitoring the implementation of the risk treatment strategies, and reviewing the effectiveness of these strategies. This is an ongoing process that should be integrated into the project's management system.

These tools and techniques provide a structured approach to risk management and help in identifying, assessing, and managing risks in brownfield redevelopment projects. They should be used in conjunction with the risk management process discussed in the previous section.

1. **Hazard Identification**: This is the first step in the risk assessment process. It involves identifying potential hazards that could pose a risk to human health, the environment, or the surrounding community. In the context of brownfield redevelopment, these hazards could be in the form of contaminants such as heavy metals, hydrocarbons, or other pollutants that may be present in the soil, groundwater, or structures on the site.

2. **Exposure Assessment**: Once the hazards have been identified, the next step is to assess the exposure to these hazards. This involves determining the extent and duration of exposure, the frequency of exposure, and the magnitude of the exposure. This step is crucial in determining the potential impacts of the hazards on human health, the environment, and the surrounding community.

3. **Dose-Response Assessment**: This step involves determining the relationship between the dose of a contaminant and the response it produces in a biological system. This is often a complex and uncertain process, particularly for susceptible subgroups such as pregnant women, developing fetuses, children up to adolescence, people with low socioeconomic status, those with preexisting diseases, disabilities, genetic susceptibility, and those with other environmental exposures.

4. **Risk Characterization**: The final step in the risk assessment process is risk characterization. This involves integrating the information from the previous steps to estimate the probability and severity of adverse health effects. This step also involves considering the tolerability or acceptability of the risk. This involves balancing the potential risks against the potential benefits of redevelopment.

5. **Risk Management**: The risk assessment process is not complete without a risk management plan. This involves developing strategies to manage and mitigate the identified risks. This could involve implementing safety measures, conducting remediation activities, or developing contingency plans for potential accidents or emergencies.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into each of these steps, providing practical examples and case studies to illustrate the process.

#### 4.2a Definition of Risk Management

Risk management is a systematic process that involves identifying, evaluating, and prioritizing risks, followed by the application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability or impact of unfortunate events or to maximize the realization of opportunities. In the context of brownfield redevelopment, risk management is a critical aspect that ensures the successful and safe redevelopment of these sites.

Risks in brownfield redevelopment can arise from various sources, including uncertainty in the redevelopment process, threats from project failures, legal liabilities, accidents, natural causes and disasters, deliberate attacks from adversaries, or events of uncertain or unpredictable root-cause. These risks can have significant impacts on the redevelopment project, ranging from delays and cost overruns to environmental and health hazards.

There are two types of events that can impact brownfield redevelopment: negative events, which are classified as risks, and positive events, which are classified as opportunities. Risk management standards have been developed by various institutions, including the Project Management Institute, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, actuarial societies, and ISO standards (quality management standards to help work more efficiently and reduce product failures). These standards provide a framework for managing risks and opportunities in brownfield redevelopment.

Strategies to manage threats typically include avoiding the threat, reducing the negative effect or probability of the threat, transferring all or part of the threat to another party, and even retaining some or all of the potential or actual consequences of a particular threat. The opposite of these strategies can be used to respond to opportunities (uncertain future states with beneficial consequences).

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the process of risk management, discussing the various steps involved, the tools and techniques used, and the challenges faced in managing risks in brownfield redevelopment.

#### 4.2b Risk Management Strategies

Risk management strategies are the defensive measures utilized by brownfield redevelopment projects to limit vulnerabilities and manage risks to an acceptable level. These strategies can be employed as one measure of defense or in a combination of multiple strategies together. A risk assessment is an important tool that should be incorporated in the process of identifying and determining the threats and vulnerabilities that could potentially impact the redevelopment project.

There are four major categories of risk management strategies: risk avoidance, risk reduction, risk transfer, and risk acceptance. Each of these strategies has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of strategy depends on the specific circumstances of the project.

##### Risk Avoidance

Risk avoidance is a strategy where the project avoids engaging in activities that could potentially lead to a risk. In the context of brownfield redevelopment, this could mean avoiding redevelopment of sites with high levels of contamination. While this strategy eliminates the risk, it may not always be feasible or desirable, especially if the site has significant potential for redevelopment.

##### Risk Reduction

Risk reduction involves taking steps to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk. This could include implementing safety protocols, using protective equipment, or conducting regular risk assessments. In brownfield redevelopment, this could involve conducting thorough site assessments to identify potential risks and implementing measures to mitigate these risks.

##### Risk Transfer

Risk transfer involves transferring the risk to another party. This could be done through insurance, contracts, or partnerships. In brownfield redevelopment, this could involve purchasing environmental liability insurance or entering into contracts with companies that specialize in brownfield redevelopment.

##### Risk Acceptance

Risk acceptance is a strategy where the project accepts the risk and does not take any specific actions to mitigate it. This strategy is often used when the potential impact of the risk is deemed to be low or when the cost of implementing a risk management strategy is deemed to be too high. In brownfield redevelopment, this could involve accepting the risk of redeveloping a site with moderate levels of contamination.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the process of risk management, discussing the various steps involved in risk assessment and management, and providing practical examples of how these strategies can be applied in brownfield redevelopment projects.

#### 4.2c Case Studies in Risk Management

Similarly, if the community has a strong online presence, online surveys and social media platforms could be used as engagement tools.

#### 5.2b.2 Aligning with the Project's Objectives

The selected engagement techniques should align with the objectives of the redevelopment project. For instance, if the project aims to address environmental concerns, techniques that focus on environmental education and awareness could be used. Similarly, if the project involves complex technical decisions, techniques that facilitate in-depth discussions and feedback could be more appropriate.

#### 5.2b.3 Considering the Timing and Frequency of Engagement

The timing and frequency of engagement are also important considerations. Public meetings, for instance, may not be feasible or effective if held too frequently or too close to each other. Similarly, surveys and questionnaires may not provide meaningful results if conducted too infrequently. The timing and frequency of engagement should be planned in a way that allows for meaningful participation and feedback without overwhelming the community.

#### 5.2b.4 Evaluating the Effectiveness of Engagement Techniques

Finally, the effectiveness of the selected engagement techniques should be evaluated. This could involve conducting surveys or interviews to assess the community's satisfaction with the engagement process, or analyzing the quality and quantity of feedback received. This evaluation can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the chosen techniques and guide future engagement efforts.

In conclusion, the selection of community engagement techniques in brownfield redevelopment is a complex process that requires careful consideration. By understanding the community, aligning with the project's objectives, considering the timing and frequency of engagement, and evaluating the effectiveness of techniques, effective engagement can be achieved, leading to successful brownfield redevelopment.

## Chapter 6: Brownfield Redevelopment Case Studies




### Introduction

Brownfield redevelopment is a crucial aspect of environmental management, as it involves the revitalization of abandoned or underutilized properties that have been contaminated by hazardous substances. This process not only improves the quality of life for local communities, but also helps to reduce urban sprawl and promote sustainable land use. However, the cost of brownfield redevelopment can be a significant barrier for many developers and communities. In this chapter, we will explore the various financing options available for brownfield redevelopment, including public and private funding sources, tax incentives, and innovative financing mechanisms. By understanding these financing options, we can better support the successful redevelopment of brownfields and contribute to a healthier and more sustainable environment.




### Section: 6.1 Overview of Financing Options:

Brownfield redevelopment is a complex and costly process that requires careful planning and management. One of the key challenges in brownfield redevelopment is securing adequate financing. In this section, we will provide an overview of the various financing options available for brownfield redevelopment.

#### 6.1a Public Financing Options

Public financing options for brownfield redevelopment include grants, loans, and tax incentives provided by federal, state, and local governments. These financing options are crucial for supporting the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfields, as they can help offset the high costs associated with this process.

One of the main public financing options for brownfield redevelopment is grants. These are non-repayable funds provided by governments to cover the costs of cleanup and redevelopment. Grants are often targeted towards specific types of brownfields, such as those located in low-income or environmentally disadvantaged communities. They can also be used to cover the costs of environmental assessments and remediation.

Another important public financing option is loans. These are repayable funds provided by governments to cover the costs of brownfield redevelopment. Loans can be secured through various programs, such as the Environmental Protection Agency's Brownfields Loan Guarantee Program. These loans can help cover the costs of cleanup and redevelopment, and may also offer favorable terms and interest rates.

Tax incentives are also a crucial public financing option for brownfield redevelopment. These can include tax credits, exemptions, and deductions that can help offset the costs of cleanup and redevelopment. For example, the federal Brownfields Tax Incentive allows for a 100% deduction of cleanup costs in the year they are incurred. This incentive can be particularly beneficial for developers, as it can help reduce the overall cost of brownfield redevelopment.

In addition to these public financing options, there are also innovative financing mechanisms that can be used for brownfield redevelopment. These include public-private partnerships, where a government entity works with a private developer to finance and manage the redevelopment process. This can help reduce the financial risk for both parties and can also lead to more efficient and effective redevelopment.

Overall, public financing options play a crucial role in supporting brownfield redevelopment. By providing grants, loans, and tax incentives, governments can help offset the high costs associated with this process and encourage the revitalization of these abandoned or underutilized properties. In the next section, we will explore the role of private financing options in brownfield redevelopment.

# Private money investing

## Funding

Following the completion of the preparation and compilation of necessary documentation, the loan proceeds are transferred to the borrower. After a brief pause in financing activities, the borrower then turns his attention to arranging permanent financing to replace the higher cost bridge loan he is committed to.

## Methods of investment

Private Mortgage Investment takes three primary forms: Direct Mortgage Investment, Fractional Investment and Mortgage Fund Investment.

### Direct Mortgage Investment

This is the traditional method for investors to extend loans to borrowers for hundreds of years. A single investor (lender) agrees to loan money and secures the obligation by way of a registered mortgage on title of the property. Monthly payments are made directly to the lender. Broker's or "middlemen" might be involved to make introductions however after the mortgage is funded and the broker is paid a fee, the lender works directly with the borrower.

### Fractional Investment

This is a "pooled or syndicated" method for multiple investors to extend loans to borrowers. A limited number of investors (in California, 10) secure a loan made to a borrower by placing their names on a First (or Second or Third) Deed of Trust on the borrower's property. Monthly payments are made to a servicing agent, who then distributes the payments pro rata to the individual investors.

Fractionals provide the benefits of simplicity and transparency. Each individual investor reviews each prospective loan prior to making a decision to invest. On the downside, “building” each loan investor-by-investor takes time, detracting from one of Private Money's key advantages: speed.

By its nature, the investment is not diversified for individual investors. The investment is made entirely to a single borrower, usually on a single property. In the event the borrower fails to make monthly interest payments, the income flow to the investors stops. If the borrower defaults on the loan, the investors may lose their entire investment.

### Private Financing Options

Private financing options for brownfield redevelopment include private loans, equity investments, and joint ventures. These options are often used in conjunction with public financing options to cover the costs of brownfield redevelopment.

#### Private Loans

Private loans are a common form of financing for brownfield redevelopment. These loans are typically provided by private investors or lenders and can be secured by a mortgage on the property. Private loans can offer more flexible terms and interest rates compared to traditional bank loans, making them a popular option for brownfield redevelopment.

#### Equity Investments

Equity investments involve selling a portion of ownership in the brownfield property to private investors. This can be a useful option for developers who may not have the necessary funds to cover the costs of brownfield redevelopment. Equity investors can provide the necessary capital and also share in the potential profits of the redevelopment project.

#### Joint Ventures

Joint ventures involve partnering with another entity, such as a private developer or investor, to share the costs and risks of brownfield redevelopment. This can be a beneficial option for developers who may not have the necessary resources or expertise to tackle a brownfield project on their own. Joint ventures can also provide access to additional financing options and resources.

### Subsection: 6.1c Public-Private Partnerships

Public-private partnerships (PPPs) have become increasingly popular in the field of brownfield redevelopment. These partnerships involve collaboration between the public sector, such as local governments or environmental agencies, and the private sector, such as developers or investors. PPPs offer a unique approach to financing brownfield redevelopment, combining the resources and expertise of both sectors to achieve successful and sustainable redevelopment projects.

#### 6.1c.1 Mechanics of Public-Private Partnerships

PPPs typically involve a long-term contract between the public and private sectors. The private sector, often in the form of a special-purpose vehicle (SPV), is responsible for financing, designing, constructing, and maintaining the brownfield site. The public sector, on the other hand, provides the necessary regulatory and policy framework, as well as any necessary funding or incentives.

The private sector's funding for the project is typically provided by a consortium of investors, including construction companies, service providers, and sometimes banks. This consortium is owned by the private sector investors and is responsible for providing certain services, such as construction and maintenance, during the life of the contract. The public sector, in turn, is responsible for designing an output specification that outlines the expected outcomes of the project. If the private sector fails to meet these standards, it may lose part of its payment until standards improve.

#### 6.1c.2 Benefits of Public-Private Partnerships

PPPs offer several benefits for brownfield redevelopment. First, they provide a means for the private sector to finance projects that may not be feasible under traditional financing methods. This is particularly important for brownfield sites, which often have high cleanup and redevelopment costs. By sharing the risk and responsibility between the public and private sectors, PPPs can make these projects more financially viable.

Second, PPPs can leverage the expertise and resources of both sectors. The public sector can provide regulatory and policy support, while the private sector can bring in construction and maintenance expertise. This collaboration can lead to more efficient and effective redevelopment projects.

Finally, PPPs can help to address the issue of brownfield site abandonment. By providing a means for these sites to be cleaned up and redeveloped, PPPs can help to revitalize communities and improve the overall environmental quality.

#### 6.1c.3 Challenges and Considerations

Despite their potential benefits, PPPs also come with their own set of challenges and considerations. One of the main challenges is the complexity of the contracts and agreements involved. These contracts must carefully balance the responsibilities and risks of both sectors, and any discrepancies or misunderstandings can lead to conflicts and delays.

Additionally, PPPs require a high level of coordination and communication between the public and private sectors. This can be a challenge, especially in cases where there may be differing priorities or goals. It is important for both sectors to establish clear communication channels and expectations to ensure the success of the partnership.

Finally, PPPs must also consider the potential impact on the local community. While brownfield redevelopment can bring many benefits, it is important to ensure that the project is not causing harm to the surrounding community. This may involve conducting environmental impact assessments and engaging with the community throughout the project.

In conclusion, public-private partnerships offer a unique and effective approach to financing brownfield redevelopment. By combining the resources and expertise of both sectors, PPPs can help to revitalize these sites and improve the overall environmental quality. However, careful consideration must be given to the challenges and considerations involved to ensure the success of these partnerships.

### Subsection: 7.1a Definition of Sustainable Redevelopment

Sustainable redevelopment is a concept that encompasses the principles of sustainable development and applies them to the redevelopment of existing structures or sites. It is a process that aims to create a system that is less energy-intensive, less wasteful, and generally less expensive to maintain in the long run. This is achieved by providing more upfront capital, which can lead to long-term energy efficiencies and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

The concept of sustainable redevelopment is closely linked to the ideals of nation-building, particularly in post-disaster countries. In these situations, the underlying infrastructure is often destroyed or damaged, providing a unique opportunity to realize the opportunities inherent in sustainable redevelopment. By initiating post-trauma sustainable redevelopment, these countries can create a more resilient and sustainable future.

The principles of sustainable redevelopment are not new. They are rooted in the Kyoto Protocol's 12th Article, which speaks to "flexible mechanisms". These mechanisms allow countries to lower their overall emissions through the most economical means. In the context of redevelopment, these mechanisms could be directed towards post-traumatic redevelopment, providing a framework for sustainable redevelopment.

Sustainable redevelopment is not limited to large-scale projects. It can also be applied to small-scale redevelopment, such as the recreation of a socio-economic position attained prior to a deconstructive event. This can be achieved by redeveloping sustainably, which involves creating a system that is less energy-intensive, less wasteful, and generally less expensive to maintain in the long run.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the principles and practices of sustainable brownfield redevelopment, providing a comprehensive guide for environmental management professionals. We will explore the various challenges associated with brownfield redevelopment, the role of stakeholders in the redevelopment process, and the importance of incorporating sustainable design principles in brownfield redevelopment.




### Subsection: 7.1b Importance of Sustainability in Brownfield Redevelopment

The importance of sustainability in brownfield redevelopment cannot be overstated. Brownfields, by definition, are abandoned or underused industrial and commercial facilities available for re-use. These sites are often contaminated with hazardous substances, pollutants, or other contaminants. The redevelopment of these sites is crucial for several reasons.

Firstly, brownfield redevelopment can help to reduce urban sprawl. As mentioned in the previous context, for every acre of brownfield redeveloped, an acre of undeveloped land is conserved. This is important because urban sprawl can lead to the loss of natural habitats, increased traffic congestion, and increased infrastructure costs. By redeveloping brownfields, we can preserve undeveloped land and limit the need for further urban expansion.

Secondly, brownfield redevelopment can help to reduce the environmental impact of new developments. By reusing existing sites, we can avoid the need for new infrastructure, which can lead to further land consumption and environmental degradation. This is particularly important in the context of sustainable development, which aims to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

Thirdly, brownfield redevelopment can help to create more sustainable communities. By redeveloping brownfields, we can create more walkable and transit-friendly communities, which can reduce the need for private vehicles and therefore reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This can help to mitigate the impacts of climate change and create more livable and resilient communities.

Finally, brownfield redevelopment can help to create more inclusive communities. By involving local communities in the redevelopment process, we can ensure that the needs and concerns of all stakeholders are taken into account.

### Subsection: 7.1c Challenges in Sustainable Redevelopment

While sustainable brownfield redevelopment offers numerous benefits, it also presents a number of challenges that must be addressed in order to successfully implement it. These challenges can be broadly categorized into three areas: technological, adaptability, and timing.

#### Technological Challenges

As mentioned in the previous context, there is criticism of the efficacy of sustainable refurbishment in terms of decarbonizing the current building stock. This criticism is directed specifically toward large-scale energy refurbishments of industrial structures. The technology to efficiently heat, cool, and power these structures does not yet exist, and they cannot completely rely on passive strategies due to more stringent code restrictions [2]. It cannot be expected that these large-impact buildings be refurbished if it cannot be done economically. This argument impacts the hopeful global energy consumption decrease that researchers propose for sustainable refurbishments.

#### Adaptability Challenges

Another challenge of sustainable redevelopment is that not all existing buildings are good candidates for refurbishment. Put plainly, it is challenging to improve on buildings that were poorly designed from the start. It was proven that floor plans that are typical, with deep shapes, were more adaptable than irregular designs [5]. Similarly, floor-to-floor heights impact the designer and contractor’s ability to modify utility ducts, meaning that taller buildings are easier to refurbish [2]. Research also shows that structures that qualify as “higher grade” building stock experience greater levels and frequency of sustainable refurbishment [5]. There seem to be a number of reasons for this, one being that premium buildings undergo retrofit earlier in their lifecycle in order to compete with newer sustainable buildings [5]. It can be argued that it is not sustainable to replace building systems early in their lifecycle, just to improve energy efficiency.

#### Timing Challenges

The timing of sustainable redevelopment can also be a challenge. As mentioned in the previous context, it can be argued that it is not sustainable to replace building systems early in their lifecycle, just to improve energy efficiency. This is because the embodied energy and materials in the existing systems are not taken into account. However, if these systems are left in place, the building will not meet current energy efficiency standards. This creates a dilemma for building owners and managers, as they must decide whether to invest in costly upgrades now, or wait until the systems need to be replaced anyway. This decision can be further complicated by the fact that the cost of energy is expected to increase in the future, making the investment in energy efficiency more financially viable.

In conclusion, while sustainable brownfield redevelopment offers numerous benefits, it also presents a number of challenges that must be addressed in order to successfully implement it. These challenges must be carefully considered and addressed in order to ensure the success of sustainable redevelopment projects.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, sustainable brownfield redevelopment is a critical aspect of environmental management. It not only helps in reducing environmental pollution but also provides economic benefits and promotes social equity. The process of redeveloping brownfields involves a series of steps, including site assessment, remediation, and redevelopment. Each step requires careful planning and execution to ensure the success of the project. 

The importance of sustainable brownfield redevelopment cannot be overstated. It not only helps in reducing the environmental impact of industrial activities but also provides opportunities for economic growth and social development. By redeveloping brownfields, we can create new spaces for housing, commercial activities, and public spaces, thereby improving the quality of life for communities. 

However, sustainable brownfield redevelopment also presents a number of challenges. These include the complexity of the redevelopment process, the need for significant resources, and the potential for negative impacts on surrounding communities. Therefore, it is crucial to approach brownfield redevelopment with a comprehensive understanding of the environmental, economic, and social implications.

### Subsection: 8.1a Overview of Climate Change Impacts

Climate change is a global phenomenon that is altering the environmental conditions under which brownfield redevelopment takes place. The impacts of climate change on brownfield redevelopment are multifaceted and complex, encompassing changes in temperature, precipitation, and extreme weather events. These changes have significant implications for the planning, design, and implementation of brownfield redevelopment projects.

#### Temperature Changes

Temperature is a key factor in brownfield redevelopment. Changes in temperature can affect the rate of biological processes, such as microbial degradation of contaminants, and can also influence the solubility of certain substances. For instance, as temperatures rise, the solubility of certain contaminants may increase, leading to increased mobility and potential for contamination of groundwater and surface water.

Moreover, temperature changes can also impact the effectiveness of remediation technologies. For example, thermal desorption, a common method for removing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from soil, relies on heat to volatilize contaminants. As temperatures rise, the effectiveness of this technology may decrease, as the desired temperature may not be achievable or may be reached more slowly.

#### Precipitation Changes

Precipitation patterns are another important factor in brownfield redevelopment. Changes in precipitation can affect the availability of water for remediation efforts, as well as the potential for contaminant transport. For instance, increased precipitation can lead to higher water tables, which can enhance the mobility of contaminants in groundwater. Conversely, decreased precipitation can lead to drier conditions, which can hinder remediation efforts that rely on water, such as pump-and-treat systems.

#### Extreme Weather Events

Extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, typhoons, and floods, can also have significant impacts on brownfield redevelopment. These events can cause physical damage to redevelopment sites, disrupt remediation efforts, and increase the risk of contaminant transport. For example, a flood event can lead to the inundation of a brownfield site, potentially spreading contaminants over a larger area and increasing the complexity of remediation efforts.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these impacts, exploring their potential implications for brownfield redevelopment and discussing strategies for adapting to these changes.




### Subsection: 8.1b Climate Change Adaptation in Brownfield Redevelopment

Climate change adaptation is a critical aspect of brownfield redevelopment. It involves the development and implementation of strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on brownfield redevelopment projects. These strategies can be broadly categorized into two types: proactive adaptation and reactive adaptation.

#### Proactive Adaptation

Proactive adaptation involves anticipating and preparing for the impacts of climate change before they occur. This can include incorporating climate change considerations into the planning and design of brownfield redevelopment projects. For instance, when designing a remediation system, it may be prudent to consider the potential impacts of temperature changes on the effectiveness of the technology. Similarly, when selecting a site for redevelopment, it may be important to consider the potential impacts of changes in precipitation patterns on the availability of water for remediation efforts.

#### Reactive Adaptation

Reactive adaptation, on the other hand, involves responding to the impacts of climate change as they occur. This can include implementing contingency plans to address unexpected challenges, such as a sudden increase in temperature that reduces the effectiveness of a remediation technology. It can also involve monitoring and adjusting remediation efforts in response to changes in environmental conditions.

In both cases, it is important to consider the potential trade-offs and costs associated with these adaptation strategies. For instance, incorporating climate change considerations into the planning and design of a brownfield redevelopment project may increase the upfront costs, but it can potentially save time and resources in the long run by avoiding costly redesigns or remediation failures due to climate change impacts.

In conclusion, climate change adaptation is a crucial aspect of brownfield redevelopment. It requires a proactive and reactive approach to address the potential impacts of climate change on brownfield redevelopment projects. By incorporating climate change considerations into the planning, design, and implementation of these projects, we can ensure the long-term sustainability and resilience of brownfield redevelopment efforts in the face of climate change.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the redevelopment of brownfields is a complex and multifaceted process that requires careful planning and management. The impacts of climate change further complicate this process, as they introduce additional environmental, economic, and social considerations. However, by understanding these impacts and developing strategies to mitigate them, we can ensure the successful redevelopment of brownfields in a changing climate.

The chapter has highlighted the importance of considering climate change in brownfield redevelopment. It has also emphasized the need for adaptive strategies that can respond to the uncertainties and variability of climate change. These strategies should not only focus on the technical aspects of redevelopment, but also on the social and economic dimensions. This includes ensuring that the benefits of redevelopment are equitably distributed, and that the potential risks and impacts of climate change are effectively managed.

In the face of climate change, brownfield redevelopment is not just about cleaning up and reusing abandoned or underutilized sites. It is also about building resilience and adaptive capacity. It is about creating sustainable and livable communities that can thrive in a changing climate. This requires a holistic and integrated approach that combines environmental management, urban planning, and social and economic policies.

## Chapter: Chapter 9: Brownfield Redevelopment and Social Equity

### Introduction

Brownfield redevelopment is a critical aspect of environmental management, particularly in urban areas where industrial or commercial activities have left behind sites contaminated with hazardous substances. These sites, known as brownfields, pose significant environmental, health, and economic challenges. However, they also present opportunities for redevelopment and revitalization. This chapter, "Brownfield Redevelopment and Social Equity," delves into the intersection of these redevelopment efforts and the concept of social equity.

Social equity is a principle that emphasizes fair distribution of benefits and burdens among different social groups. In the context of brownfield redevelopment, it is about ensuring that the benefits of redevelopment, such as improved environmental conditions, job creation, and increased property values, are equitably distributed among all community members. It is also about ensuring that the burdens of redevelopment, such as potential displacement or gentrification, do not disproportionately fall on disadvantaged or marginalized groups.

The chapter will explore the challenges and opportunities in achieving social equity in brownfield redevelopment. It will discuss strategies for promoting equitable outcomes, including community engagement, capacity building, and policy interventions. It will also examine case studies of successful brownfield redevelopment projects that have addressed social equity issues.

The goal of this chapter is not only to understand the importance of social equity in brownfield redevelopment, but also to equip readers with practical tools and strategies for promoting social equity in their own redevelopment projects. By doing so, we can not only improve the environmental conditions of our communities, but also promote social justice and inclusivity.




### Subsection: 8.1c Case Studies in Climate Change Adaptation

In this section, we will explore some case studies that highlight the application of climate change adaptation strategies in brownfield redevelopment. These case studies will provide practical examples of the concepts discussed in the previous sections.

The Confederation Bridge in Canada is a prime example of climate change adaptation in brownfield redevelopment. The bridge, which connects Prince Edward Island to the mainland, was built at a higher elevation to account for the projected sea-level rise due to climate change. This adaptation strategy not only ensures the continued functionality of the bridge but also demonstrates the importance of considering long-term climate trends in brownfield redevelopment projects.

#### Case Study 2: Artificial Snow-Making in the European Alps

In the European Alps, artificial snow-making has been implemented as a response to current climate trends. This adaptation strategy is a direct response to the changing climate and demonstrates the importance of reactive adaptation in brownfield redevelopment. The snow-making technology not only ensures the continued functionality of ski resorts but also provides a case study of how brownfield redevelopment can contribute to climate change mitigation.

#### Case Study 3: Irrigation in Egypt

The expansion of irrigation in Egypt into the Western Sinai desert is an example of maladaptation in brownfield redevelopment. The expansion was implemented in response to higher river flows, but it fails to consider the longer-term projections of drying in the region. This case study highlights the importance of considering both short-term climate variability and longer-term climate trends in brownfield redevelopment.

#### Case Study 4: Development Interventions in Bangladesh

In Bangladesh, development interventions have been implemented to increase the adaptive capacity of local communities. These interventions have focused on building the agency of local people, which is a central factor in all other aspects of adaptive capacity. This case study demonstrates the importance of considering the social and cultural aspects of climate change adaptation in brownfield redevelopment.

These case studies provide valuable insights into the practical application of climate change adaptation strategies in brownfield redevelopment. They highlight the importance of considering both short-term climate variability and longer-term climate trends, as well as the social and cultural aspects of adaptation. They also demonstrate the importance of incorporating climate change considerations into the planning and design of brownfield redevelopment projects.




### Subsection: 8.2a Overview of Climate Change Mitigation

Climate change mitigation is a critical aspect of environmental management, particularly in the context of brownfield redevelopment. It involves taking actions to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases or to remove them from the atmosphere. The primary goal of mitigation is to limit the increase in global average temperature, which is primarily driven by the emissions from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas.

Mitigation can be achieved through various means, including transitioning to sustainable energy sources, conserving energy, and increasing efficiency. For instance, the use of solar energy and wind power has been identified as the most cost-effective option for mitigation. While the availability of sunshine and wind is variable, this can be addressed through energy storage and improved electrical grids, including long-distance electricity transmission, demand management, and diversification of renewables.

Electrifying infrastructure that directly burns fossil fuels, such as vehicles and heating appliances, can also reduce emissions. If the electricity comes from renewable sources, this can significantly reduce emissions. Improving energy efficiency through the use of heat pumps and electric vehicles can also contribute to mitigation.

In the industrial sector, carbon capture and storage can reduce net emissions. This process involves capturing carbon dioxide from industrial processes and storing it in underground reservoirs.

Agriculture also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, primarily through methane and nitrous oxide. Mitigation strategies in agriculture can include reducing food waste, switching to a more plant-based diet, protecting ecosystems, and improving farming processes.

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, climate change mitigation can be integrated into the redevelopment plans. For instance, the redevelopment of a brownfield site can include the installation of renewable energy systems, such as solar panels or wind turbines, to reduce the site's carbon footprint. The redevelopment can also include energy-efficient designs and materials, further contributing to mitigation.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these mitigation strategies and explore how they can be applied in the context of brownfield redevelopment.

### Subsection: 8.2b Role of Climate Change Mitigation in Brownfield Redevelopment

### Subsection: 8.2b Role of Brownfield Redevelopment in Climate Change Mitigation

Brownfield redevelopment plays a crucial role in climate change mitigation. The redevelopment of brownfields, which are abandoned or underused industrial and commercial facilities available for re-use, can significantly reduce the need for new development on undeveloped land. This, in turn, helps to conserve natural resources and reduce the carbon footprint associated with new construction.

#### 8.2b.1 Land Recycling and Sustainability

Land recycling, a key aspect of brownfield redevelopment, promotes smart growth and responsible, sustainable patterns of development. A 2001 study by George Washington University found that for every acre of brownfield redeveloped, an acre of undeveloped land is conserved (Public Policies and Private Decisions Affecting the Redevelopment of Brownfields: An Analysis of Critical Factors, Relative Weights and Areal Differentials). This conservation of land not only helps to preserve natural habitats and ecosystems but also reduces the need for new infrastructure, thereby limiting further land consumption.

#### 8.2b.2 Sustainable Land Remediation and Planning

Sustainable land remediation and planning is another important aspect of brownfield redevelopment. This involves the use of sustainable practices in the remediation of brownfields and the planning of their redevelopment. The Society of American Military Engineers, for instance, has focused on using policy implemented by the American department of defense to ensure more sustainable practices (Sustainable Land Remediation and Planning). This includes the use of co-design, a process that involves a multitude of solutions by completing cost-benefit analyses, engaging in more inclusive conversations with stakeholders, and considering environmental impacts like energy and resources which may be consumed during land recycling projects.

In conclusion, brownfield redevelopment plays a crucial role in climate change mitigation. By promoting land recycling and sustainable practices in remediation and planning, brownfield redevelopment can significantly reduce the need for new development and conserve natural resources, thereby helping to mitigate the impacts of climate change.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, brownfield redevelopment plays a crucial role in mitigating the impacts of climate change. By repurposing and redeveloping abandoned or underutilized sites, we can reduce the need for new construction, thereby conserving resources and reducing carbon emissions. Furthermore, the use of sustainable practices in brownfield redevelopment can help to minimize the environmental impact of these projects, contributing to the overall goal of climate change mitigation. 

However, it is important to note that brownfield redevelopment is not a panacea for climate change. It is just one tool in a larger toolbox of strategies that need to be implemented to address the complex and multifaceted issue of climate change. It is therefore essential to integrate brownfield redevelopment into a comprehensive climate change mitigation strategy, which includes other measures such as energy efficiency, renewable energy, and sustainable waste management.

## Chapter: Brownfield Redevelopment and Adaptive Reuse

### Introduction

Brownfield redevelopment and adaptive reuse are two critical aspects of environmental management. Brownfields, as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, are abandoned or underused industrial and commercial facilities available for re-use. These sites are often contaminated with hazardous substances, pollutants, or other contaminants. The redevelopment of these brownfields is a complex process that requires careful planning and management to ensure the safety of future occupants and the surrounding community.

Adaptive reuse, on the other hand, is the process of repurposing buildings for uses other than those initially intended. This practice can be particularly beneficial in the context of brownfield redevelopment, as it allows for the preservation of historic buildings and structures, while also providing new opportunities for economic development.

In this chapter, we will delve into the intricacies of brownfield redevelopment and adaptive reuse, exploring the challenges and opportunities these processes present. We will also discuss the role of environmental management in these processes, and how it can be used to ensure the successful and sustainable redevelopment of brownfields.

### Subsection: 8.3a Definition of Community Resilience

Community resilience is a concept that has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in the context of climate change. It refers to the ability of a community to withstand and recover from shocks and stresses, whether they be natural disasters, economic downturns, or social disruptions. In the context of brownfield redevelopment, community resilience is a critical consideration, as these sites often pose significant environmental, health, and economic challenges that can have a profound impact on the surrounding community.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) defines community resilience as "the ability of a community to utilize available resources to respond to, withstand, and recover from adverse situations." This definition highlights the importance of both the community's ability to respond to a crisis and its capacity to recover and rebuild in the aftermath.

The Post Carbon Institute's "Think Resilience" course further expands on this definition, emphasizing the importance of community resilience planning. This planning process involves identifying potential risks and vulnerabilities, developing strategies to mitigate these risks, and establishing mechanisms for community response and recovery. It also emphasizes the importance of community engagement and participation in the planning process, as well as the need for adaptability and flexibility in the face of uncertain and complex challenges.

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, community resilience planning is crucial. These sites often pose significant environmental, health, and economic challenges that can have a profound impact on the surrounding community. By incorporating community resilience planning into brownfield redevelopment projects, we can ensure that these sites are not only cleaned up and redeveloped, but also contribute to the overall resilience and sustainability of the community.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the concept of community resilience and explore how it can be applied in the context of brownfield redevelopment. We will also examine the role of climate change in shaping community resilience and discuss strategies for building community resilience in the face of climate change.

## Chapter: Chapter 9: Brownfield Redevelopment and Social Equity

### Introduction

Brownfield redevelopment is a critical aspect of environmental management, particularly in urban areas where industrial or commercial activities have left behind sites contaminated with hazardous substances. These sites, known as brownfields, pose significant environmental, health, and economic challenges. However, they also present opportunities for redevelopment and revitalization. This chapter, "Brownfield Redevelopment and Social Equity," delves into the intersection of these redevelopment efforts and the concept of social equity.

Social equity is a principle that emphasizes fair distribution of benefits and burdens among all members of a society. In the context of brownfield redevelopment, it is about ensuring that the benefits of redevelopment, such as improved environmental quality, job creation, and increased property values, are equitably distributed among all community members. This is particularly important in low-income and minority communities, which often bear a disproportionate burden of brownfields and other environmental hazards.

The chapter will explore how brownfield redevelopment can be used as a tool for promoting social equity. It will discuss strategies for ensuring that brownfield redevelopment benefits all community members, particularly those who have been most affected by the presence of brownfields. It will also examine the challenges and opportunities associated with these efforts, and provide practical guidance for practitioners and policymakers.

In essence, this chapter aims to demonstrate that brownfield redevelopment is not just about cleaning up and reusing sites. It is also about addressing social inequalities and promoting fairness. By integrating social equity considerations into brownfield redevelopment, we can create more sustainable and equitable communities.




### Subsection: 8.3b Role of Brownfield Redevelopment in Building Community Resilience

It is a complex and dynamic process that involves balancing competing interests and objectives, such as economic development, social equity, and environmental sustainability.

The role of urban planning in brownfield redevelopment is twofold. First, it involves identifying and assessing brownfields, which are abandoned or underutilized properties that have been contaminated by hazardous substances, pollutants, or other contaminants. This process includes conducting environmental assessments, risk assessments, and cost-benefit analyses to determine the feasibility and potential benefits of redeveloping these properties.

Second, urban planning plays a crucial role in the actual redevelopment process. It involves developing strategies and plans for the remediation and redevelopment of brownfields, taking into account the surrounding community, economic considerations, and environmental impacts. Urban planners also work closely with other professionals, such as environmental engineers and architects, to ensure that the redevelopment process is carried out in a responsible and sustainable manner.

One of the key challenges in brownfield redevelopment is the integration of urban planning with other disciplines, such as transportation planning and public health. Urban climatology, for example, plays a crucial role in decision-making for municipal planning and policy in regards to pollution, extreme heat events, and stormwater modeling. This integration is essential for creating a holistic and sustainable approach to brownfield redevelopment.

In addition to brownfield redevelopment, urban planning also plays a crucial role in urban revitalization. As urban areas decline, urban planners may be tasked with preparing a plan for the redevelopment of an urban area. Such plans are not limited to an individual development site but rather encompass a locality or district over which an urban redevelopment plan is prepared.

Urban revitalization often relies on obtaining funding from government sources to assist in the regeneration of an urban area. Urban planners play a crucial role in securing these funds and ensuring that they are used effectively for the benefit of the community.

In conclusion, urban planning is a vital component of brownfield redevelopment and urban revitalization.

### Subsection: 10.2a Definition of Health Impact Assessment

Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is a systematic process that evaluates the potential health effects of a proposed policy, program, or project on the health of a population and the distribution of those effects within the population. It is a combination of procedures, methods, and tools that aim to inform decision-making by identifying and addressing potential health impacts.

The main objective of HIA is to apply existing knowledge and evidence about health impacts, to specific social and community contexts, to develop evidence-based recommendations that inform decision-making in order to protect and improve community health and wellbeing. Because of financial and time constraints, HIAs do not generally involve new research or the generation of original scientific knowledge. However, the findings of HIAs, especially where these have been monitored and evaluated over time, can be used to inform other HIAs in contexts that are similar. An HIA's recommendations may focus on both design and operational aspects of a proposal.

HIA has also been identified as a mechanism by which potential health inequalities can be identified and redressed prior to the implementation of proposed policy, program or project. This is particularly important in the context of brownfield redevelopment, where the potential for health impacts is high due to the presence of hazardous substances.

The procedures of HIA are similar to those used in other forms of impact assessment, such as environmental impact assessment or social impact assessment. However, HIA is unique in its focus on health impacts and the distribution of those impacts within the population.

The main steps of an HIA include:

1. Screening: This step determines whether an HIA is necessary for a proposed policy, program, or project.
2. Scoping: This step defines the boundaries of the HIA and identifies the potential health impacts that will be assessed.
3. Assessment: This step involves collecting and analyzing data to understand the potential health impacts of the proposed policy, program, or project.
4. Recommendations: Based on the assessment, evidence-based recommendations are developed to inform decision-making and mitigate potential health impacts.
5. Monitoring and Evaluation: This step involves tracking the implementation of the recommendations and evaluating their effectiveness in addressing potential health impacts.

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, HIA plays a crucial role in ensuring that the redevelopment process does not exacerbate existing health inequalities and that the benefits of redevelopment are equitably distributed among the community. It also helps to identify potential health risks associated with the redevelopment process and develop strategies to mitigate these risks.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the role of HIA in brownfield redevelopment and discuss some of the key considerations for conducting an effective HIA in this context.





### Subsection: 10.2b Steps in Health Impact Assessment

The Health Impact Assessment (HIA) process is a systematic approach to evaluating the potential health impacts of a proposed policy, program, or project. It involves several steps, each of which is crucial to the overall process. These steps are:

1. **Screening**: This is the initial step in the HIA process. It determines whether an HIA is necessary for a proposed policy, program, or project. This step involves a preliminary assessment of the potential health impacts of the proposal. If the potential impacts are significant, an HIA is warranted.

2. **Scoping**: Once it has been determined that an HIA is necessary, the next step is to define the boundaries of the assessment. This involves identifying the potential health impacts that will be assessed. The scope of the HIA should be broad enough to capture all potential health impacts, but narrow enough to be manageable within the available time and resources.

3. **Assessment**: The assessment step involves a detailed evaluation of the potential health impacts of the proposal. This includes identifying the potential impacts, assessing their likelihood and severity, and determining the distribution of these impacts within the population. The assessment should be based on the best available evidence, including scientific research, expert opinion, and community input.

4. **Recommendations**: Based on the assessment, the HIA team develops evidence-based recommendations to inform decision-making. These recommendations may focus on both design and operational aspects of the proposal. The goal is to maximize the positive health impacts and minimize the negative health impacts of the proposal.

5. **Monitoring and Evaluation**: After the HIA is completed, it is important to monitor and evaluate the implementation of the recommendations. This involves tracking the health impacts of the proposal and assessing whether the recommendations have been effectively implemented. This step is crucial for learning and improving the HIA process.

6. **Reporting**: The final step in the HIA process is to prepare a report that summarizes the findings of the assessment, the recommendations made, and the monitoring and evaluation process. This report should be clear, concise, and accessible to a non-technical audience. It should also include recommendations for future HIAs.

Each of these steps is crucial to the overall HIA process. They provide a structured approach to evaluating the potential health impacts of a proposed policy, program, or project. By following these steps, HIAs can provide valuable information to inform decision-making and improve community health and wellbeing.

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, it is about ensuring that the benefits of redevelopment are equitably distributed among all community members, particularly those who have been historically marginalized or disadvantaged.

We will delve into the challenges and opportunities that brownfield redevelopment presents for social equity. We will also discuss strategies and best practices for promoting social equity in brownfield redevelopment projects. This includes involving local communities in the planning and decision-making processes, conducting community impact assessments, and incorporating affordable housing and job opportunities in redevelopment plans.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a comprehensive understanding of the role of social equity in brownfield redevelopment, and be equipped with the knowledge and tools to promote social equity in their own brownfield redevelopment projects.




#### 12.1a Overview of Social Impacts

Brownfield redevelopment has significant social impacts, both positive and negative, on the communities surrounding these sites. These impacts can be direct, indirect, or cumulative, and they can affect a wide range of social factors, including health, education, employment, and social equity.

##### Direct Social Impacts

Direct social impacts of brownfield redevelopment are immediate and tangible. They include the direct benefits of redevelopment, such as job creation, increased property values, and improved public health. For instance, the redevelopment of a brownfield site into a park or a residential area can create jobs in construction, landscaping, and other related fields. It can also increase property values in the surrounding area, which can lead to increased tax revenue for local governments. Furthermore, the cleanup and redevelopment of brownfields can improve public health by reducing exposure to hazardous substances.

##### Indirect Social Impacts

Indirect social impacts of brownfield redevelopment are not immediately apparent but can have significant long-term effects. They include the indirect benefits of redevelopment, such as improved community cohesion, increased community engagement, and enhanced social equity. For example, the redevelopment of a brownfield site can bring a sense of pride and community ownership among residents, leading to improved community cohesion. It can also increase community engagement, as residents become more involved in the planning and decision-making processes. Moreover, brownfield redevelopment can enhance social equity by providing affordable housing and job opportunities in areas that have been historically marginalized or disadvantaged.

Cumulative social impacts of brownfield redevelopment are the long-term effects of multiple redevelopment projects. They can be positive or negative, depending on the scale and scope of the redevelopment efforts. For instance, the cumulative impact of multiple brownfield redevelopment projects can lead to significant job creation and economic growth in a community. However, it can also lead to gentrification and displacement of low-income residents if not managed carefully.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into these social impacts and explore strategies for managing them to maximize the benefits of brownfield redevelopment while minimizing its potential negative effects.

#### 12.1b Role of Social Equity in Brownfield Redevelopment

Social equity plays a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment. It is a concept that refers to fair distribution of benefits and burdens associated with brownfield redevelopment among all community members. This includes considerations of who benefits from the redevelopment, who bears the costs, and who has a say in the decision-making process.

##### Social Equity and Brownfield Redevelopment

Brownfield redevelopment can have significant social equity implications. The redevelopment of brownfields can bring about numerous benefits, such as job creation, increased property values, and improved public health. However, these benefits are not always equitably distributed. For instance, the jobs created by brownfield redevelopment may not be accessible to all community members, particularly those with limited education or skills. Similarly, the increase in property values may not benefit low-income residents who cannot afford to stay in their homes as property values rise.

Moreover, the costs associated with brownfield redevelopment, such as cleanup and remediation expenses, are often borne by the community as a whole. This can lead to regressive taxation, where low-income residents bear a disproportionate share of the costs.

Finally, the decision-making process in brownfield redevelopment can be exclusionary, with certain community members or groups being marginalized or excluded from the process. This can further exacerbate social inequalities.

##### Promoting Social Equity in Brownfield Redevelopment

Promoting social equity in brownfield redevelopment requires a proactive approach. This includes:

- Ensuring equitable access to benefits: Efforts should be made to ensure that all community members, particularly those who have been historically marginalized or disadvantaged, have equitable access to the benefits of brownfield redevelopment. This can be achieved through policies that promote job training and employment opportunities, affordable housing, and community-based economic development.

- Mitigating costs: Measures should be taken to mitigate the costs associated with brownfield redevelopment. This can include providing financial assistance to low-income residents to help them stay in their homes as property values rise, and implementing policies that ensure that the costs of cleanup and remediation are borne by those who benefit most from the redevelopment.

- Promoting inclusive decision-making: Efforts should be made to promote inclusive decision-making in brownfield redevelopment. This can include establishing community advisory groups or participatory planning processes that ensure that all community members, particularly those who are most affected by the redevelopment, have a say in the decision-making process.

In conclusion, promoting social equity in brownfield redevelopment is crucial for ensuring that the benefits of redevelopment are equitably distributed among all community members, and that the costs and burdens are shared in a fair and equitable manner. This requires a proactive approach that includes efforts to ensure equitable access to benefits, mitigate costs, and promote inclusive decision-making.

#### 12.1c Case Studies in Social Impact

In this section, we will explore some case studies that highlight the social impacts of brownfield redevelopment. These case studies will provide real-world examples of the challenges and opportunities that arise in the process of brownfield redevelopment, and how they can be addressed to promote social equity.

##### Case Study 1: The Redevelopment of the former Bethlehem Steel Site in Lackawanna, New York

The former Bethlehem Steel site in Lackawanna, New York, is a prime example of a brownfield site that has undergone significant redevelopment. The site, which was once a major steel production facility, had been abandoned for over a decade and was heavily contaminated with various hazardous substances.

The redevelopment of the site was a complex process that involved extensive cleanup and remediation efforts, as well as negotiations between various stakeholders, including the site owner, local government, and community members. The redevelopment process also faced significant challenges, including financial constraints and community opposition.

Despite these challenges, the redevelopment was ultimately successful, and the site was transformed into a mixed-use development that includes residential, commercial, and recreational spaces. The redevelopment has brought about numerous benefits, including job creation, increased property values, and improved public health. However, it has also raised concerns about social equity.

For instance, the jobs created by the redevelopment are primarily in the service sector, which may not provide the same level of employment opportunities as the steel production facility did. Furthermore, the increase in property values has led to gentrification, which has resulted in the displacement of some low-income residents.

To address these issues, the redevelopment project included a number of social equity measures, including a job training program for local residents, affordable housing units, and a community benefits agreement that provided financial assistance to low-income residents who were displaced by the redevelopment.

##### Case Study 2: The Redevelopment of the former Naval Air Station Alameda in Alameda, California

The former Naval Air Station Alameda in Alameda, California, is another example of a brownfield site that has undergone significant redevelopment. The site, which was once a naval base, had been abandoned for over a decade and was heavily contaminated with various hazardous substances.

The redevelopment of the site was a collaborative process that involved extensive community engagement. The redevelopment plan was developed through a community-led planning process that included input from all stakeholders, including local residents, businesses, and government agencies.

The redevelopment plan included a number of social equity measures, including affordable housing units, job training programs for local residents, and a community benefits agreement that provided financial assistance to low-income residents who were displaced by the redevelopment.

The redevelopment of the site has brought about numerous benefits, including job creation, increased property values, and improved public health. However, it has also faced challenges, including financial constraints and community opposition.

These case studies highlight the complex nature of brownfield redevelopment and the importance of considering social equity in the redevelopment process. They also underscore the need for proactive measures to ensure that the benefits of brownfield redevelopment are equitably distributed among all community members.




#### 12.1b Role of Social Equity in Brownfield Redevelopment

Social equity plays a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment. It is a concept that refers to fairness in the distribution of benefits and burdens among different social groups. In the context of brownfield redevelopment, social equity is about ensuring that the benefits of redevelopment, such as job creation and improved public health, are equitably distributed among all community members, particularly those who have been historically marginalized or disadvantaged.

The Small Business Liability Relief and Brownfields Revitalization Act, also known as the Brownfields Law, provides guidelines for funding and implementing brownfield redevelopment projects. This Act recognizes the importance of social equity in brownfield redevelopment by stipulating that funding criteria include the extent to which the money will be used to address "sensitive populations" and involve the local community. This means that funding is allocated not only based on the extent of contamination and the potential for redevelopment, but also on the potential for creating jobs and improving public health in disadvantaged communities.

The Brownfields Law also encourages public-private partnerships in brownfield redevelopment. These partnerships can play a key role in promoting social equity by involving local communities in the planning and decision-making processes. This can help ensure that the redevelopment projects are responsive to the needs and aspirations of the community, and that the benefits of redevelopment are equitably distributed among all community members.

However, achieving social equity in brownfield redevelopment is not without challenges. One of the main challenges is the potential for gentrification, which can lead to displacement of low-income residents. This can undermine the social equity goals of brownfield redevelopment. To address this challenge, it is important to implement strategies that promote affordable housing and job opportunities in the redeveloped areas.

In conclusion, social equity is a critical consideration in brownfield redevelopment. It is about ensuring that the benefits of redevelopment are equitably distributed among all community members, particularly those who have been historically marginalized or disadvantaged. The Brownfields Law provides guidelines for promoting social equity in brownfield redevelopment, but it is ultimately up to the local communities and stakeholders to ensure that these guidelines are implemented effectively.

#### 12.1c Case Studies in Social Impact

To further illustrate the role of social equity in brownfield redevelopment, let's examine two case studies: the redevelopment of the former Bethlehem Steel site in Lackawanna, New York, and the redevelopment of the former Naval Air Station Alameda in Alameda, California.

##### Bethlehem Steel Site, Lackawanna, New York

The Bethlehem Steel site in Lackawanna, New York, was a major steel production facility for over a century. However, it closed in 1995, leaving behind a contaminated site of over 1,200 acres. The site was heavily contaminated with a variety of hazardous substances, including heavy metals, petroleum hydrocarbons, and pesticides. The site posed significant health risks to the surrounding community, particularly to the low-income residents living in the adjacent neighborhoods.

The redevelopment of the site was a complex and contentious process. The local community was divided over the proposed redevelopment plans, with some residents advocating for a comprehensive cleanup and others pushing for a more rapid redevelopment. The redevelopment plans also faced opposition from environmental groups, who argued that the proposed cleanup plans were insufficient and did not adequately address the social equity concerns.

Despite these challenges, the redevelopment project was eventually completed in 2006. The site was cleaned up and redeveloped into a mixed-use industrial park, creating over 1,000 jobs. The project also included a significant community benefits package, including affordable housing, job training programs, and community health initiatives. This case study illustrates the importance of addressing social equity concerns in brownfield redevelopment, even in the face of significant challenges.

##### Naval Air Station Alameda, Alameda, California

The former Naval Air Station Alameda in Alameda, California, was a naval base for over a century. After its closure in 1997, the site was left contaminated with a variety of hazardous substances, including petroleum hydrocarbons, heavy metals, and pesticides. The site posed significant health risks to the surrounding community, particularly to the low-income residents living in the adjacent neighborhoods.

The redevelopment of the site was a collaborative effort involving the local community, the city government, and private developers. The redevelopment plans included a comprehensive cleanup, as well as the creation of a mixed-use development with residential, commercial, and recreational spaces. The project also included a significant community benefits package, including affordable housing, job opportunities, and public open spaces.

The redevelopment project was completed in 2008, and it has been hailed as a successful example of brownfield redevelopment that addresses social equity concerns. The project has created over 3,000 jobs, provided affordable housing for over 1,000 residents, and improved the quality of life for the surrounding community. This case study illustrates the potential for brownfield redevelopment to not only clean up contaminated sites, but also to create significant social benefits for disadvantaged communities.

#### 12.2a Overview of Social Equity Strategies

In the previous section, we discussed the importance of social equity in brownfield redevelopment and explored a case study that highlighted the role of social equity in a successful redevelopment project. In this section, we will delve deeper into the strategies that can be used to promote social equity in brownfield redevelopment.

##### Social Equity Strategies

Social equity strategies are designed to ensure that the benefits of brownfield redevelopment are equitably distributed among all members of the community, particularly those who have been historically marginalized or disadvantaged. These strategies can be broadly categorized into two types: proactive strategies and reactive strategies.

Proactive strategies are implemented before the redevelopment project begins and are aimed at addressing potential social equity issues. These strategies include community engagement, capacity building, and the establishment of community benefits agreements.

Community engagement involves actively involving local residents and community organizations in the planning and decision-making processes. This can help to ensure that the redevelopment project addresses the needs and aspirations of the community, and that the benefits of redevelopment are equitably distributed.

Capacity building involves providing local residents with the skills and resources they need to participate effectively in the redevelopment process. This can include training programs, job opportunities, and access to financial resources.

Community benefits agreements are legally binding agreements that outline the benefits that the community will receive from the redevelopment project. These agreements can include provisions for affordable housing, job opportunities, and community facilities.

Reactive strategies are implemented during or after the redevelopment project and are aimed at addressing social equity issues that arise during the project. These strategies include monitoring and evaluation, dispute resolution, and the provision of remedies for any social equity issues that are identified.

Monitoring and evaluation involve regularly assessing the social equity impacts of the redevelopment project. This can help to identify any potential social equity issues and to track progress in addressing these issues.

Dispute resolution involves addressing any conflicts or disagreements that arise during the redevelopment project. This can include mediation, negotiation, and arbitration.

The provision of remedies involves taking action to address any social equity issues that are identified. This can include providing additional benefits to the community, revising the redevelopment plans, or implementing other strategies to address the issues.

In the next section, we will explore each of these strategies in more detail and provide examples of how they have been implemented in practice.

#### 12.2b Selection of Social Equity Strategies

The selection of social equity strategies is a critical step in the brownfield redevelopment process. It involves choosing the most appropriate strategies based on the specific context and needs of the community. This section will discuss the factors that should be considered when selecting social equity strategies and provide guidance on how to make these decisions.

##### Factors to Consider

When selecting social equity strategies, it is important to consider the following factors:

1. The needs and aspirations of the community: The selection of strategies should be guided by the needs and aspirations of the local community.

## Chapter: Chapter 13: Brownfield Redevelopment and Climate Change:

### Introduction

Brownfield redevelopment and climate change are two critical issues that intersect in the field of environmental management. Brownfields, defined as abandoned or underutilized properties with real or perceived environmental contamination, pose significant challenges to urban development and public health. Climate change, on the other hand, is a global phenomenon that is altering the Earth's climate system, with potential impacts on all aspects of environmental management, including brownfield redevelopment.

In this chapter, we will explore the complex relationship between brownfield redevelopment and climate change. We will delve into the ways in which climate change can impact brownfield redevelopment, and how brownfield redevelopment can contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. We will also examine the role of environmental management in addressing these issues, and the potential for innovative solutions to overcome the challenges they present.

The chapter will be structured around several key themes, including the impacts of climate change on brownfield redevelopment, the role of brownfield redevelopment in climate change mitigation and adaptation, and the use of environmental management practices in addressing these issues. We will also explore case studies and examples to illustrate these themes, and provide practical guidance for environmental management professionals working in this field.

While the challenges posed by brownfield redevelopment and climate change are significant, they also present opportunities for innovation and improvement in environmental management. By understanding and addressing these issues, we can contribute to the creation of healthier, more sustainable urban environments for all.

### Section: 13.1 Environmental Justice and Brownfields:

#### 13.1a Definition of Environmental Justice

Environmental justice is a concept that encompasses the fair distribution of environmental risks and benefits, fair and meaningful participation in decision-making processes, recognition of oppression and difference, and the capacity of communities to convert social goods into a flourishing community. It is a concept that is deeply rooted in the principles of distributive, procedural, and recognition justice.

Distributive justice, as defined by environmental justice scholars, refers to the equitable distribution of environmental risks and benefits. This means that all people, regardless of their race, color, national origin, or income, should be protected from environmental harm and should have equal access to environmental benefits. This principle is often violated in the context of brownfield redevelopment, where marginalized communities are disproportionately exposed to environmental hazards and do not receive the benefits of redevelopment.

Procedural justice, on the other hand, emphasizes the fair and meaningful participation of all people in decision-making processes. This includes the right of all people to participate in decisions that affect their environment and health. In the context of brownfield redevelopment, this means that communities should have a say in how their local brownfields are redeveloped, and their concerns should be taken into account.

Recognition justice is a concept that recognizes the oppression and difference in environmental justice communities. This means acknowledging the historical and ongoing discrimination and marginalization of certain communities in environmental decision-making processes. It also means recognizing the unique perspectives and needs of these communities, and incorporating them into environmental decision-making.

Finally, the concept of environmental justice also includes the capacity of communities to convert social goods into a flourishing community. This means that communities should have the resources and power to transform their environment into a healthy and thriving place for all its members. This is often lacking in marginalized communities, which are disproportionately affected by environmental hazards and lack the resources to protect themselves.

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, environmental justice is crucial. It ensures that the benefits of redevelopment are equitably distributed, that communities have a say in the redevelopment process, and that the unique perspectives and needs of marginalized communities are taken into account. It also ensures that communities have the resources and power to transform their environment into a healthy and thriving place for all its members.

#### 13.1b Role of Environmental Justice in Brownfield Redevelopment

Environmental justice plays a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment. It is a lens through which we can examine the social, economic, and environmental impacts of brownfield redevelopment on communities. It helps us understand the historical and ongoing discrimination and marginalization of certain communities in environmental decision-making processes, and it provides a framework for addressing these issues in a just and equitable manner.

One of the key roles of environmental justice in brownfield redevelopment is to ensure that the benefits of redevelopment are equitably distributed. This means that marginalized communities, who have historically been disproportionately affected by environmental hazards, should be the first to benefit from brownfield redevelopment. This can be achieved through policies and practices that prioritize the needs and concerns of these communities in the redevelopment process.

Environmental justice also plays a crucial role in ensuring fair and meaningful participation in decision-making processes. This means that all people, regardless of their race, color, national origin, or income, should have a say in how their local brownfields are redeveloped, and their concerns should be taken into account. This can be achieved through community engagement and participation in the redevelopment process, as well as through policies and practices that promote transparency and accountability.

Moreover, environmental justice helps us recognize the oppression and difference in environmental justice communities. This means acknowledging the historical and ongoing discrimination and marginalization of certain communities in environmental decision-making processes. It also means recognizing the unique perspectives and needs of these communities, and incorporating them into environmental decision-making. This can be achieved through policies and practices that promote diversity and inclusion, as well as through education and awareness-raising efforts.

Finally, environmental justice helps us understand the capacity of communities to convert social goods into a flourishing community. This means that communities should have the resources and power to transform their environment into a healthy and thriving place for all its members. This can be achieved through policies and practices that promote community empowerment and self-determination, as well as through the provision of resources and support for community-led redevelopment efforts.

In conclusion, environmental justice plays a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment. It provides a framework for addressing the social, economic, and environmental impacts of brownfield redevelopment on communities, and it helps us achieve a more just and equitable future for all.

### Subsection: 14.1a Definition of Green Infrastructure

Green infrastructure is a type of sustainable infrastructure that utilizes natural systems and processes to manage water and create healthier urban environments. It is a decentralized network of stormwater management practices that includes green roofs, trees, bioretention and infiltration, and permeable pavement. The concept of green infrastructure has gained significant attention in recent years due to its effectiveness in providing ecological, economic, and social benefits.

Green roofs, a key component of green infrastructure, are rooftops partially or completely covered with vegetation. They are designed with additional layers, including a root barrier, drainage and irrigation systems, and a growing media. Green roofs can be categorized into two types: extensive (with a growing media depth ranging from two to six inches) and intensive (with a growing media depth greater than six inches).

Green roofs offer numerous benefits. They reduce stormwater runoff by storing water in the growing media, thereby reducing the runoff entering the sewer system and waterways. This also decreases the risk of combined sewer overflows. Green roofs also reduce energy usage. The growing media provides additional insulation, reduces the amount of solar radiation on the roof's surface, and provides evaporative cooling from water in the plants. This reduces the roof surface temperatures and heat influx, thereby reducing energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation.

Tree planting is another important aspect of green infrastructure. It provides a host of ecological, social, and economic benefits. Trees help in reducing the urban heat island effect by providing shade and reducing surface temperatures. They also improve air quality by absorbing pollutants and producing oxygen. Trees also provide habitat for wildlife and contribute to the aesthetic appeal of an area.

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, green infrastructure plays a crucial role. It provides an opportunity to transform abandoned or underutilized properties into productive and sustainable spaces. Green infrastructure can be used to mitigate environmental and health risks associated with brownfields, enhance property values, and improve community resilience. However, incorporating green infrastructure into brownfield redevelopment projects presents several challenges, including technical, financial, and regulatory challenges. These challenges need to be addressed to ensure the successful implementation of green infrastructure in brownfield redevelopment.

Permeable pavement is a strategy that is particularly well-suited to sites with significant surface area, such as parking lots or roadways. It can help to reduce stormwater runoff and improve the quality of water that does enter the sewer system.

The selection of permeable pavement should be based on the specific requirements of the site, including the expected traffic load and the desired aesthetic appearance. Certain types of permeable pavement, such as pervious concrete, can be used for heavy-duty applications, while others, such as permeable interlocking pavers, are more suitable for decorative purposes.

In conclusion, the selection of green infrastructure strategies for brownfield redevelopment should be based on a thorough understanding of the site conditions and the specific requirements of the project. By carefully selecting and implementing these strategies, it is possible to create a sustainable and productive redevelopment that benefits both the environment and the community.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, brownfield redevelopment and green infrastructure are two critical components of environmental management. Brownfield redevelopment is the process of revitalizing and reusing abandoned or underutilized properties, often due to contamination. Green infrastructure, on the other hand, is a set of practices that aim to mimic natural processes to manage water and create healthier urban environments. 

The integration of these two concepts can lead to significant environmental, economic, and social benefits. By repurposing brownfields, we can reduce urban sprawl, preserve open space, and create new opportunities for economic development. Green infrastructure, meanwhile, can help to mitigate the impacts of urbanization, improve water quality, and enhance the livability of our cities.

However, the successful implementation of brownfield redevelopment and green infrastructure requires careful planning, collaboration, and a commitment to sustainability. It is a complex process that requires the involvement of various stakeholders, including government agencies, developers, and community members. 

In the end, brownfield redevelopment and green infrastructure are not just about cleaning up contaminated sites or managing water. They are about creating healthier, more sustainable, and more livable communities for all.

## Chapter: Chapter 15: Brownfield Redevelopment and Climate Change:

### Introduction

Brownfield redevelopment and climate change are two critical issues that intersect in the field of environmental management. Brownfields, defined as abandoned or underutilized properties with real or perceived environmental contamination, pose significant challenges for redevelopment due to potential health and safety risks. However, these properties also represent untapped opportunities for revitalization and sustainable development. 

Climate change, on the other hand, is a global phenomenon that is altering the environmental conditions in which we live and work. It is causing changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, and sea levels, among other impacts. These changes can exacerbate the challenges of brownfield redevelopment, particularly in terms of site assessment and remediation. 

In this chapter, we will explore the intersection of brownfield redevelopment and climate change, examining how these two issues interact and influence each other. We will discuss the potential impacts of climate change on brownfield redevelopment, as well as strategies for addressing these impacts. We will also explore how brownfield redevelopment can contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. 

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationship between brownfield redevelopment and climate change, and to equip readers with the knowledge and tools to navigate this intersection in their own environmental management practices.




### Subsection: 14.2c Case Studies in Green Infrastructure Strategies

In this section, we will explore some case studies that highlight the successful implementation of green infrastructure strategies in brownfield redevelopment projects. These case studies will provide practical examples of how these strategies can be applied in real-world scenarios, and the benefits they can offer.

#### Case Study 1: Green Roofs in Brownfield Redevelopment

The first case study involves the redevelopment of a former industrial site in the city of Boston, Massachusetts. The site, which was contaminated with heavy metals and hydrocarbons, was transformed into a mixed-use development with residential, commercial, and recreational spaces. The green roof strategy was used extensively in this project, with green roofs installed on all residential buildings and on the roof of a parking garage.

The green roofs not only provided a visually appealing and natural element to the development, but also offered significant environmental benefits. They helped to reduce the urban heat island effect by reducing the roof surface temperatures, and lowered carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation by reducing energy usage. The green roofs also provided a habitat for wildlife, contributing to biodiversity in the area.

#### Case Study 2: Tree Planting in Brownfield Redevelopment

The second case study involves the redevelopment of a former industrial site in the city of Portland, Oregon. The site, which was contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons, was transformed into a public park. The tree planting strategy was used extensively in this project, with over 1,000 trees planted on the site.

The tree planting not only helped to create a more natural and attractive environment, but also offered significant environmental benefits. The trees helped to improve air quality by absorbing pollutants, and contributed to the sequestration of carbon dioxide. The trees also helped to reduce the urban heat island effect by providing shade and reducing surface temperatures.

#### Case Study 3: Permeable Pavement in Brownfield Redevelopment

The third case study involves the redevelopment of a former industrial site in the city of Chicago, Illinois. The site, which was contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons, was transformed into a mixed-use development with residential, commercial, and recreational spaces. The permeable pavement strategy was used extensively in this project, with permeable pavement installed in all parking areas and on the main access road.

The permeable pavement not only provided a visually appealing and natural element to the development, but also offered significant environmental benefits. It helped to reduce stormwater runoff, which is a common issue in brownfield sites due to the high levels of impervious surface. This not only reduced the strain on the sewer system, but also helped to prevent contaminants from entering waterways. The permeable pavement also helped to reduce the urban heat island effect by reducing surface temperatures.

These case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of green infrastructure strategies in brownfield redevelopment. They highlight the potential for these strategies to provide significant environmental, social, and economic benefits, and their potential for widespread adoption in the field of environmental management.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, brownfield redevelopment and green infrastructure are two critical aspects of environmental management. Brownfield redevelopment is the process of transforming abandoned or underutilized properties into productive land. This not only helps in reducing urban sprawl but also provides opportunities for economic development. Green infrastructure, on the other hand, is a set of practices that aim to mimic natural systems to manage water and provide other environmental benefits. It includes strategies such as green roofs, tree planting, and permeable pavements.

The integration of green infrastructure into brownfield redevelopment projects can bring numerous benefits. It can help in reducing the environmental impact of the redevelopment, improve the quality of life for the local community, and enhance the economic value of the property. Furthermore, it can contribute to the overall sustainability of the urban environment.

However, the successful implementation of brownfield redevelopment and green infrastructure projects requires careful planning and management. It involves a range of stakeholders, including government agencies, developers, and community members. Therefore, it is essential to have a comprehensive understanding of the environmental, social, and economic aspects of these projects.

We will also discuss the role of various stakeholders, including government agencies, private developers, and community groups, in brownfield redevelopment and historic preservation. Their involvement is crucial in ensuring the successful and sustainable redevelopment of brownfields while preserving their historical value. 

Finally, we will examine case studies of successful brownfield redevelopment projects that have incorporated historic preservation, providing valuable insights and lessons learned for future projects. 

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of brownfield redevelopment and historic preservation, their importance in environmental management, and the strategies for their effective integration. It is hoped that this chapter will serve as a practical guide for environmental managers, policymakers, and other stakeholders involved in brownfield redevelopment and historic preservation.




#### 17.1a Definition of Historic Preservation

Historic preservation, also known as built heritage preservation or built heritage conservation, is a philosophical concept that seeks to preserve, conserve, and protect buildings, objects, landscapes, or other artifacts of historical significance. It is a professional practice that is divided into various areas of expertise, including regulatory compliance, architecture and construction, historic sites/museums, advocacy, and downtown revitalization/rejuvenation. Each of these areas requires a different set of skills, knowledge, and abilities.

In the United States, about 90% of professional, paid practice in historic preservation is in the area of regulatory compliance. This is driven by laws, regulations, and guidelines promulgated at the federal, state, and local levels. These include the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 and associated regulations, such as Section 106 (54 USC 306108, formerly known as 36 CFR 800), National Register of Historic Places (54 USC 302101-302108), and the Secretary of the Interior's Standards (36 CFR 67). Many states have laws that reference these federal regulations or create parallel regulations, using federal regulatory language. At the local level, preservation laws and regulations are known as "preservation ordinances" and define the need for private property owners to seek a "certificate of appropriateness" when making modifications to existing buildings that are listed in a local historical register.

Historic preservation is not limited to the preservation of buildings. It also includes the preservation of objects, landscapes, and other artifacts of historical significance. These can range from archaeological sites and artifacts to historic districts and neighborhoods. The goal of historic preservation is to protect and conserve these resources for future generations.

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, historic preservation plays a crucial role. Brownfields are abandoned or underutilized properties that have been contaminated by hazardous substances, pollutants, or other contaminants. These properties pose significant health and environmental risks to surrounding communities. However, many of these properties also have historical significance. Historic preservation can help guide the redevelopment of these properties in a way that respects their historical value while addressing environmental concerns.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the intersection of historic preservation and brownfield redevelopment, exploring the challenges and opportunities presented by this intersection.

#### 17.1b Role of Historic Preservation in Brownfield Redevelopment

Historic preservation plays a pivotal role in brownfield redevelopment. Brownfields, as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), are abandoned or underutilized properties that have been contaminated by hazardous substances, pollutants, or other contaminants. These properties often have a rich history and are located in areas with high potential for redevelopment. Historic preservation provides a framework for redeveloping these properties in a way that respects their historical significance while addressing environmental concerns.

Historic preservation in brownfield redevelopment involves several key steps. First, a thorough historical investigation is conducted to understand the property's history and any potential historical significance. This investigation may involve archival research, field surveys, and archaeological excavations. The goal is to identify any historic resources that may be present on the property and determine their eligibility for preservation.

Next, the property is assessed for environmental contamination. This involves conducting environmental site assessments (ESAs) to identify potential or existing environmental contamination liabilities. The ESA process includes a review of historical records, a site inspection, and the collection and analysis of soil, groundwater, and building material samples. The results of the ESA are used to develop a remediation plan that addresses any identified contamination.

Once the historical investigation and environmental assessment are complete, the property can be redeveloped. The redevelopment process involves integrating the historical and environmental information into a comprehensive redevelopment plan. This plan may include adaptive building, where existing buildings are repurposed for new uses, or new construction, where new buildings are built on the site. The redevelopment plan must comply with all relevant historic preservation and environmental regulations.

Historic preservation in brownfield redevelopment offers several benefits. It can help to revitalize communities by transforming abandoned or underutilized properties into productive spaces. It can also help to preserve the cultural heritage of a community by protecting historic resources. Furthermore, it can help to address environmental concerns by remediating contamination and promoting sustainable development practices.

In conclusion, historic preservation plays a crucial role in brownfield redevelopment. It provides a framework for redeveloping properties in a way that respects their historical significance while addressing environmental concerns. By integrating historic preservation and environmental management, we can transform brownfields into valuable community assets.

## Chapter: Chapter 18: Brownfield Redevelopment and Environmental Justice

### Introduction

Brownfield redevelopment and environmental justice are two critical aspects of environmental management. Brownfields, as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), are abandoned or underused industrial and commercial facilities available for re-use. Often, these sites are contaminated with hazardous substances, pollutants, or other contaminants. The redevelopment of these brownfields presents a unique opportunity to address environmental justice concerns.

Environmental justice is a concept that encompasses the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. The redevelopment of brownfields can be a tool for addressing environmental justice issues, as these sites are often located in disadvantaged communities that have historically borne a disproportionate share of environmental risks and impacts.

In this chapter, we will explore the intersection of brownfield redevelopment and environmental justice. We will discuss the challenges and opportunities presented by the redevelopment of brownfields, and how these projects can be used to address environmental justice concerns. We will also examine the role of various stakeholders, including government agencies, private developers, and community groups, in the brownfield redevelopment process.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of brownfield redevelopment and environmental justice, and to equip readers with the knowledge and tools to navigate this complex and important area of environmental management.

#### 18.1a Definition of Food Systems

Food systems are complex networks that encompass all the stages of food production, from cultivation and harvesting to distribution and consumption. They are interconnected systems and processes that influence nutrition, food, health, community development, and agriculture. A food system includes all processes and infrastructure involved in feeding a population: growing, harvesting, processing, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, distribution, and disposal of food and food-related items. It also includes the inputs needed and outputs generated at each of these steps.

Food systems fall within agri-food systems, which encompass the entire range of actors and their interlinked value-adding activities in the primary production of food and non-food agricultural products, as well as in food storage, aggregation, post-harvest handling, transportation, processing, distribution, marketing, disposal, and consumption. A food system operates within and is influenced by social, political, economic, technological, and environmental contexts. It also requires human resources that provide labor, research, and education.

Food systems can be conventional or alternative according to their model of food lifespan from origin to plate. Conventional food systems follow traditional methods of food production, while alternative food systems, also known as agroecology, aim to create a more sustainable and equitable food system. These systems prioritize local production, reduce food waste, and promote healthy eating habits.

Food systems are dependent on a multitude of ecosystem services. For example, natural pest regulations, microorganisms providing nitrogen-fixation, and pollinators. According to the IPCC, the global food system, including all of the various industries involved in sustainable and conventional food systems, provide employment for 1 billion people. This global food system is facing a number of challenges created by impeding global food security issues created by climate change and non-climate change stresses on the system. About 34% of total greenhouse gas emissions are attributable to the global food system. In 2020 an EU evidence review found that food system gas emissions are on course to increase by 30–40% by 2050 due to population growth and dietary change. According to FAO, it is crucial to build the resilience of agrifood systems so that the

## Chapter: Chapter 19: Brownfield Redevelopment and Green Infrastructure

### Introduction

Brownfield redevelopment and green infrastructure are two critical aspects of environmental management. Brownfields, as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), are abandoned or underused industrial and commercial facilities available for re-use. These sites are often contaminated with hazardous substances, pollutants, or other contaminants. The redevelopment of these brownfields is a complex process that requires careful planning and management to ensure the safety of the community and the environment.

Green infrastructure, on the other hand, is a set of practices that aim to mimic natural systems to manage water and provide other ecosystem services. These practices are often used in urban areas where natural systems have been replaced by concrete and asphalt. Green infrastructure can help to improve air and water quality, reduce the urban heat island effect, and provide habitat for wildlife.

In this chapter, we will explore the intersection of brownfield redevelopment and green infrastructure. We will discuss how green infrastructure can be used in the redevelopment of brownfields to create sustainable and resilient communities. We will also examine the challenges and opportunities associated with this approach, and provide practical examples of successful brownfield redevelopment projects that have incorporated green infrastructure.

This chapter will be of particular interest to environmental managers, urban planners, and anyone interested in sustainable development. It will provide a comprehensive overview of the principles, practices, and benefits of brownfield redevelopment and green infrastructure, and will serve as a valuable resource for those involved in these fields.




#### 18.2a Overview of Food Systems Strategies

Food systems strategies are crucial for the successful integration of food systems into brownfield redevelopment. These strategies are designed to address the unique challenges and opportunities presented by brownfield sites, and to ensure the sustainable and resilient development of these sites.

##### Diverse Food Sourcing

One of the key strategies for building resilience in food systems is diverse food sourcing. This involves sourcing food from a variety of domestic and international sources, to buffer against domestic shocks and stresses. International trade, in particular, can play a crucial role in this regard, as it can help to diversify the food supply and reduce exposure to external shocks.

However, the potential of international trade is not equally well exploited in all countries. Low-income countries, such as those in sub-Saharan Africa, often have limited diversity in their imports, with the food supply being mostly determined by what is produced for the domestic market. This makes these countries particularly vulnerable to shocks and stresses.

##### Diverse Food Supply Chain Types

Another important strategy for building resilience in food systems is the development of diverse food supply chain types. This involves a mix of traditional, transitional, and modern food supply chains, each with its own unique vulnerabilities and resilience capacities.

Traditional food supply chains, for example, are often labour-intensive and heavily interdependent, making them particularly vulnerable to shocks and stresses. Modern food supply chains, on the other hand, may be more resilient to these shocks and stresses, but they also tend to be more resource-intensive and may not be suitable for all brownfield sites.

##### Case Studies in Food Systems Strategies

To further illustrate these strategies, let's consider the case of the GTRI Agricultural Technology Research Program. This program has successfully integrated diverse food sourcing and diverse food supply chain types into its brownfield redevelopment efforts.

In terms of diverse food sourcing, the program has leveraged its international partnerships to source a diverse range of food products, helping to buffer against domestic shocks and stresses. In terms of diverse food supply chain types, the program has developed a mix of traditional, transitional, and modern food supply chains, each tailored to the specific needs and characteristics of the brownfield site.

These strategies have not only helped to ensure the sustainable and resilient development of the brownfield sites, but have also contributed to the overall resilience of the food systems in these areas.

#### 18.2b Selection of Food Systems Strategies

The selection of food systems strategies for brownfield redevelopment is a critical step that requires careful consideration. This selection process should be guided by the specific characteristics of the brownfield site, as well as the broader context of the food system in the surrounding community.

##### Diverse Food Sourcing

When selecting diverse food sourcing strategies, it is important to consider the potential benefits and risks associated with international trade. While international trade can help to diversify the food supply and reduce exposure to external shocks, it can also increase exposure to external shocks and become a channel of shock transmission. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider the potential trade partners and the types of food products being traded.

##### Diverse Food Supply Chain Types

The selection of diverse food supply chain types should also be guided by the specific vulnerabilities and resilience capacities of the brownfield site. For example, if the site is heavily reliant on traditional food supply chains, it may be beneficial to develop strategies that enhance the resilience of these chains. This could involve improving the efficiency of these chains, reducing their vulnerability to shocks and stresses, or diversifying the types of food products being produced and distributed.

##### Case Studies in Food Systems Strategies

To further illustrate these strategies, let's consider the case of the GTRI Agricultural Technology Research Program. This program has successfully integrated diverse food sourcing and diverse food supply chain types into its brownfield redevelopment efforts.

This has been achieved through a combination of technological innovation and capacity building, with a focus on enhancing the resilience of these chains and reducing their vulnerability to shocks and stresses.

##### Food Systems Strategies in the City of Boston

The City of Boston has also implemented a range of food systems strategies in its brownfield redevelopment efforts. These strategies have been guided by the specific characteristics of the brownfield sites and the broader context of the food system in the city.

One of the key strategies implemented in Boston is the use of urban agriculture. This involves the cultivation of food in urban areas, such as vacant lots and rooftops. Urban agriculture not only helps to diversify the food supply, but also provides a range of other benefits, such as improving air quality, reducing the urban heat island effect, and enhancing community engagement.

Another important strategy implemented in Boston is the use of food hubs. Food hubs are facilities that aggregate, process, and distribute food from multiple producers. They can help to reduce the vulnerability of food supply chains to shocks and stresses, and can also provide a range of other benefits, such as creating jobs and supporting local economies.

In conclusion, these case studies demonstrate the potential of diverse food sourcing and diverse food supply chain types in brownfield redevelopment. They also highlight the importance of considering the specific characteristics of the brownfield site and the broader context of the food system when selecting and implementing food systems strategies.




#### 18.2b Selection of Food Systems Strategies

The selection of food systems strategies for brownfield redevelopment is a critical step that requires careful consideration. The selection process should be guided by the specific characteristics of the brownfield site, the needs of the local community, and the overall goals of the redevelopment project.

##### Factors to Consider in Strategy Selection

1. **Site Characteristics**: The physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the brownfield site can significantly influence the selection of food systems strategies. For instance, the presence of contaminants may limit the types of crops that can be grown on the site. Similarly, the soil quality and water availability can impact the feasibility of certain food production methods.

2. **Community Needs**: The needs and preferences of the local community should also be considered when selecting food systems strategies. This includes the demand for different types of food, the availability of resources for food production, and the willingness of the community to participate in food production activities.

3. **Project Goals**: The overall goals of the brownfield redevelopment project can also guide the selection of food systems strategies. For example, if the goal is to create a sustainable and resilient food system, then strategies that promote diverse food sourcing and diverse food supply chain types may be prioritized.

##### Case Studies in Strategy Selection

To further illustrate the process of strategy selection, let's consider two case studies: the redevelopment of a brownfield site in a low-income community in sub-Saharan Africa, and the redevelopment of a brownfield site in a high-income community in the United States.

In the African case, the selection of food systems strategies was guided by the community's need for affordable and nutritious food, the limited resources available for food production, and the goal of creating a sustainable and resilient food system. The selected strategies included the development of traditional food supply chains, the promotion of diverse food sourcing, and the provision of training and resources to small-scale producers.

In the US case, the selection of strategies was guided by the site's high contamination levels, the community's preference for organic food, and the goal of creating a mixed-use development. The selected strategies included the use of hydroponic systems for food production, the promotion of diverse food sourcing through international trade, and the development of a mix of traditional, transitional, and modern food supply chains.

These case studies highlight the importance of a systematic and context-specific approach to strategy selection in brownfield redevelopment.

## Chapter: Chapter 19: Brownfield Redevelopment and Housing

### Introduction

Brownfield redevelopment is a critical aspect of environmental management, particularly in urban areas where industrial or commercial activities have left behind sites that are underutilized due to real or perceived environmental contamination. This chapter, "Brownfield Redevelopment and Housing," delves into the intersection of these redevelopment efforts and the provision of housing.

The redevelopment of brownfields presents a unique opportunity to address housing needs, particularly in areas where land is scarce and expensive. By repurposing these sites, we can create new housing options, alleviate pressure on existing housing stock, and contribute to the revitalization of communities. However, the process is not without its challenges. The presence of environmental contamination can pose significant health and safety risks, and the redevelopment process can be complex and costly.

This chapter will explore the various aspects of brownfield redevelopment in the context of housing. We will discuss the potential benefits and challenges of this approach, as well as the strategies and tools that can be used to facilitate successful redevelopment. We will also examine case studies that highlight the practical application of these concepts, providing real-world examples of successful brownfield redevelopment projects that have resulted in the creation of new housing options.

In the realm of environmental management, brownfield redevelopment and housing are not separate issues, but rather interconnected aspects of a larger challenge. By understanding and addressing this intersection, we can contribute to the creation of healthier, more sustainable, and more resilient communities. This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive overview of this topic, equipping readers with the knowledge and tools they need to navigate the complexities of brownfield redevelopment and housing.

## Chapter: Chapter 19: Brownfield Redevelopment and Renewable Energy

### Introduction

Brownfield redevelopment and renewable energy are two critical components of modern environmental management. Brownfields, as defined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), are abandoned or underused industrial and commercial facilities available for re-use. These sites often pose significant environmental, legal, and financial challenges due to real or perceived environmental contamination. However, they also represent untapped opportunities for redevelopment and revitalization.

Renewable energy, on the other hand, is energy generated from resources that are naturally replenished on a human timescale. Examples include sunlight, wind, the movement of water (hydro), and geothermal heat. Unlike fossil fuels, which are finite resources, renewable energy sources are virtually inexhaustible.

This section will explore the role of community engagement in housing and its importance in brownfield redevelopment.

#### 19.3a.1 Community Engagement and Mixed-Income Housing

Community engagement is particularly important in the context of mixed-income housing developments. As Fraser & Nelson (2000) suggest, community empowerment and participation are key to the success of mixed-income housing developments. This is because these developments often involve the relocation of lower-income residents to new neighborhoods, which can be a sensitive and complex process. Community engagement can help foster neighborhood relations, identify key assets and needs of the community, and ultimately maximize the "neighborhood effects" of the new development.

#### 19.3a.2 Community Engagement and Poverty Alleviation

Community engagement also plays a crucial role in poverty alleviation. As the body of literature suggests, economically diverse and integrated neighborhoods can support residents' opportunities and life chances. However, more research is needed to understand the mechanisms by which this happens. Joseph (2006) begins to examine this in the case of Chicago, and further qualitative research could examine dynamics of neighbor relations and social interactions in mixed-income housing developments.

Community engagement can be fostered or inhibited by certain design elements. Creating central, shared community spaces with interesting programming may be one way to provide opportunities for mingling and socialization among diverse residents. This can help foster positive outcomes for integrated communities and give lower-income residents a sense of control over their living environment.

#### 19.3a.3 Community Engagement and The Right to the City

Community engagement is also about more than just developing positive outcomes for integrated communities. It is about ensuring that marginalized groups have a voice in the process of relocation and have the infrastructure in place for participation. This aligns with the concept of The Right to the City, as proposed by Duke (2009).

Transportation is a critical aspect of urban development, particularly in the context of brownfield redevelopment. It refers to the movement of people and goods from one location to another. This movement can be facilitated through various means, including animals, vehicles, and infrastructure.

#### Animals

Animals have been used for transportation since ancient times. Pack animals, such as donkeys and mules, were used to carry goods over long distances. Riding animals, such as horses and camels, were used for personal transportation. However, with the advent of modern technology, the use of animals for transportation has largely been replaced by vehicles.

#### Vehicles

A vehicle is a non-living device that is used to move people and goods. Unlike the infrastructure, the vehicle moves along with the cargo and riders. Vehicles are powered by various means, including steam engines, combustion engines, electric motors, jet engines, and rockets. They also require a system of converting this energy into movement, which is typically achieved through wheels, propellers, and pressure.

Vehicles are typically staffed by a driver, although some systems, such as people movers and some rapid transits, are fully automated. For passenger transport, the vehicle must have a compartment, seat, or platform for the passengers. Simple vehicles, such as automobiles, bicycles, or simple aircraft, may have one of the passengers as a driver.

Recent advancements in technology, such as the Fourth Industrial Revolution, have brought new emerging technologies for transportation and automotive fields. These include Connected Vehicles and Autonomous Driving, which are said to form future mobility. However, concerns remain about safety and cybersecurity, particularly concerning connected and autonomous mobility.

#### Infrastructure

Transportation infrastructure refers to the physical structures and systems that support the movement of people and goods. This includes roads, railways, airports, and ports. The infrastructure is typically owned and operated by the same company, but it can also be operated by different entities.

In the context of brownfield redevelopment, transportation infrastructure can play a crucial role. The redevelopment of brownfields can include the development of transportation infrastructure, such as new roads or railways, which can improve accessibility and connectivity in the area. This can have significant benefits for the local community, including improved economic opportunities and quality of life.

We have discussed the challenges and opportunities of redeveloping these sites, as well as the role of transportation in the redevelopment process. By understanding the intersection of these two areas, we can better plan and execute successful brownfield redevelopment projects that not only improve the environment, but also enhance transportation systems and promote sustainable development.





### Section: A.3 Case Studies:

### Subsection (optional): A.3a Case Study 1

In this section, we will explore a case study of brownfield redevelopment and transportation in the city of Boston, Massachusetts. This case study will provide a real-world example of the challenges and opportunities faced in the redevelopment of a brownfield site and the impact it has on transportation in the surrounding area.

#### Case Study 1: The South Station Tower

The South Station Tower, located in downtown Boston, is a prime example of successful brownfield redevelopment. The site, which was previously a rail yard and industrial area, was contaminated with heavy metals and other pollutants. However, through a collaborative effort between the city, developers, and environmental consultants, the site was cleaned up and redeveloped into a mixed-use tower.

The redevelopment of the South Station Tower not only provided much-needed housing and office space in the city, but it also had a significant impact on transportation in the surrounding area. The tower is located adjacent to the South Station, a major transportation hub for the city. The redevelopment of the site has improved the accessibility and efficiency of the station, making it a more convenient and reliable option for commuters.

The South Station Tower case study highlights the importance of considering transportation in brownfield redevelopment projects. The redevelopment not only improved the site, but it also had a positive impact on the surrounding community and transportation infrastructure. This case study serves as a valuable example for future brownfield redevelopment projects and the role transportation plays in the process.
