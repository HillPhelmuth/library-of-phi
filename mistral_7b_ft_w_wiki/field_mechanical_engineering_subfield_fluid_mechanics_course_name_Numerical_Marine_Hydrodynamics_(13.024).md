## Foreward

Welcome to "Numerical Marine Hydrodynamics: A Comprehensive Guide (13.024)". This book aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex and fascinating world of marine hydrodynamics, with a particular focus on the numerical methods used to study and model it.

Marine hydrodynamics is a field that deals with the study of the motion of water in the ocean, including its interactions with the atmosphere, the seafloor, and the living organisms that inhabit it. It is a field that is of great importance to our understanding of the Earth's climate system, the distribution of marine life, and the impact of human activities on the ocean.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of numerical methods to study marine hydrodynamics. These methods allow us to simulate and model complex oceanic processes in a controlled and precise manner, providing insights that would be difficult or impossible to obtain through traditional observational methods.

This book will provide a comprehensive overview of these numerical methods, including their principles, applications, and limitations. It will also delve into the fascinating world of eddy saturation and eddy compensation, two key concepts in the study of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC).

Eddy saturation refers to the phenomenon where the mean current in the Atlantic Ocean is insensitive to the accelerating wind forcing. This is a result of the balance between the Eulerian circulation and eddy-induced circulation, which is depth-dependent. Eddy compensation, on the other hand, refers to the near independence of the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) to the increase of wind stress.

The book will explore these concepts in depth, providing a detailed analysis of their dynamics and implications for the AMOC. It will also discuss the role of eddy saturation and eddy compensation in the context of climate change, and the potential impacts of these phenomena on the Earth's climate system.

This book is intended for advanced undergraduate students at MIT, but it will also be of great value to graduate students, researchers, and professionals in the field of marine hydrodynamics. It is our hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for those interested in understanding and studying the complex dynamics of the ocean.

Thank you for joining us on this journey into the world of numerical marine hydrodynamics. We hope that this book will provide you with a deeper understanding of this fascinating field and inspire you to explore it further.

## Chapter 1: Incompressible Fluid Mechanics Background:

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the fundamental principles of incompressible fluid mechanics, which forms the basis of numerical marine hydrodynamics. Incompressible fluid mechanics is a branch of fluid mechanics that deals with fluids that are assumed to have a constant density. This assumption simplifies the governing equations and allows us to focus on the primary physical phenomena at play.

We will begin by discussing the basic concepts of fluid mechanics, such as fluid flow, pressure, and viscosity. We will then move on to the Navier-Stokes equations, which are the fundamental equations of fluid mechanics. These equations describe the motion of fluid substances and are derived from the principles of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy.

Next, we will explore the concept of incompressibility and its implications for fluid flow. We will also discuss the Bernoulli equation, which is a simplified form of the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible, inviscid flow. This equation is widely used in many engineering applications, including marine hydrodynamics.

Finally, we will touch upon the concept of boundary layers, which are regions near the surface of a body where the flow is significantly affected by the presence of the body. Understanding boundary layers is crucial for predicting the behavior of fluid flow around marine structures.

By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of the principles of incompressible fluid mechanics, which will serve as a foundation for the more advanced topics covered in the subsequent chapters. This knowledge will be essential for understanding and applying numerical methods in marine hydrodynamics. 




### Section 1.1 Fluid Properties:

In this section, we will explore the fundamental properties of fluids that are essential for understanding fluid mechanics. These properties include density, pressure, and viscosity.

#### 1.1a Fluid Statics

Fluid statics is the study of fluids at rest. In this state, the fluid particles are not moving, and the forces acting on them are balanced. The fundamental principle governing fluid statics is the principle of hydrostatic equilibrium, which states that the pressure at any point in a fluid at rest is the same in all directions.

The pressure at a point in a fluid is given by the equation:

$$
P = \rho gh
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, and $h$ is the height of the fluid column above the point.

This equation is derived from the balance of forces acting on a fluid element. The pressure force acting on the element is equal to the weight of the fluid element, which is given by the product of the density, volume, and acceleration due to gravity.

In the case of a fluid at rest, the pressure force is balanced by the gravitational force acting on the fluid element. This balance of forces results in the principle of hydrostatic equilibrium.

The principle of hydrostatic equilibrium is fundamental to many applications in marine hydrodynamics. For example, it is used to calculate the pressure at different depths in the ocean, which is crucial for understanding the behavior of marine structures and the movement of ocean currents.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of fluid dynamics, which deals with fluids in motion.

#### 1.1b Fluid Dynamics

Fluid dynamics is the study of fluids in motion. Unlike fluid statics, where the fluid particles are at rest, in fluid dynamics, the particles are moving. The fundamental principles governing fluid dynamics include the principles of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy.

The principle of conservation of mass, also known as the continuity equation, states that the mass of a fluid element remains constant as it moves through the fluid. This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) = 0
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $t$ is time, $\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity of the fluid, and $\nabla \cdot$ denotes the divergence operator.

The principle of conservation of momentum, also known as the Navier-Stokes equations, describes the motion of fluid particles. These equations are derived from Newton's second law of motion and are given by:

$$
\rho \frac{D \mathbf{v}}{D t} = -\nabla P + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \rho \mathbf{g}
$$

where $P$ is the pressure, $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, and $\mathbf{g}$ is the acceleration due to gravity. The operator $\frac{D}{Dt}$ is the material derivative, which describes the rate of change of a quantity following a fluid particle.

The principle of conservation of energy, also known as the first law of thermodynamics, states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or converted from one form to another. In fluid dynamics, this principle is often expressed in terms of the Bernoulli equation, which relates the pressure, velocity, and elevation of a fluid particle in a steady flow. The Bernoulli equation is given by:

$$
\frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 + \rho gh + P = constant
$$

where $v$ is the velocity of the fluid, $h$ is the elevation, and $P$ is the pressure.

These principles form the basis of fluid dynamics and are used to analyze and predict the behavior of fluid flows in various applications, including marine hydrodynamics. In the next section, we will explore some of these applications in more detail.

#### 1.1c Fluid Dynamics in Marine Hydrodynamics

Marine hydrodynamics is a specialized field of fluid dynamics that deals with the study of fluid flows in the marine environment. This field is crucial for understanding and predicting the behavior of ocean currents, waves, and other phenomena that affect marine structures and navigation.

One of the key aspects of marine hydrodynamics is the study of fluid dynamics in the presence of waves. Waves introduce additional forces and motions that can significantly affect the behavior of a fluid flow. For example, the presence of waves can cause a fluid flow to become unsteady, with the flow properties changing in time and space. This can be particularly challenging to model and predict, especially in the presence of complex wave patterns and interactions.

Another important aspect of marine hydrodynamics is the study of turbulent flows. Turbulence is a complex phenomenon that is characterized by chaotic and unpredictable fluid motions. In the marine environment, turbulence can be caused by a variety of factors, including wave breaking, wind stress, and interactions with the seafloor and marine structures. Understanding and predicting turbulent flows is crucial for many applications, including the design of marine structures and the prediction of ocean currents.

The principles of fluid dynamics, as discussed in the previous section, are applied in marine hydrodynamics to model and predict the behavior of fluid flows in the marine environment. For example, the continuity equation is used to account for the changes in fluid mass due to wave-induced motions and turbulence. The Navier-Stokes equations are used to describe the motion of fluid particles in the presence of waves and turbulence. The Bernoulli equation is used to relate the pressure, velocity, and elevation of a fluid particle in a steady flow, which can be useful for understanding and predicting the behavior of ocean currents.

In addition to these principles, marine hydrodynamics also involves the use of specialized techniques and models, such as wave-current interaction models, turbulence models, and ocean circulation models. These techniques and models are used to account for the complex and dynamic nature of fluid flows in the marine environment.

In the next section, we will explore some of these techniques and models in more detail, and discuss how they are used in the study of marine hydrodynamics.




#### 1.1b Fluid Dynamics

Fluid dynamics is a branch of fluid mechanics that deals with fluid flow—the science of liquids and gases in motion. This field has a wide range of applications, including calculating forces and moments on aircraft, determining the mass flow rate of petroleum through pipelines, predicting how blood moves through the heart, understanding nebulae in interstellar space and modelling fission in nuclear reactors.

The fundamental principles governing fluid dynamics include the principles of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. These principles are often expressed mathematically, and they form the basis for many of the equations used in fluid dynamics.

The principle of conservation of mass, also known as the continuity equation, states that the mass of a fluid element remains constant as it moves through a fluid. This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) = 0
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $t$ is time, $\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity of the fluid, and $\nabla \cdot$ denotes the divergence operator.

The principle of conservation of momentum, also known as the Navier-Stokes equations, describes the motion of fluid particles. These equations are derived from Newton's second law of motion and are given by:

$$
\rho \frac{D \mathbf{v}}{D t} = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \rho \mathbf{g}
$$

where $p$ is the pressure, $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, and $\mathbf{g}$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

The principle of conservation of energy, also known as the first law of thermodynamics, states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or converted from one form to another. In fluid dynamics, this principle is often expressed in terms of the Bernoulli equation, which relates the pressure, velocity, and elevation of a fluid particle in a steady flow.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the principles of fluid dynamics and explore how they are applied in the study of marine hydrodynamics.




#### 1.1c Fluid Kinematics

Fluid kinematics is the study of the motion of fluids, without considering the forces that cause the motion. It is a fundamental aspect of fluid dynamics and is closely related to the principles of fluid dynamics. In this section, we will explore the basic concepts of fluid kinematics, including the velocity field, streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines.

##### Velocity Field

The velocity field of a fluid describes the velocity of every point in the fluid at a given time. It is a vector field, meaning that it has both a magnitude and a direction at every point. The velocity field is a crucial concept in fluid kinematics, as it provides a complete description of the motion of the fluid.

The velocity field can be represented mathematically as a function of position and time, $\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x}, t)$, where $\mathbf{x}$ is the position vector and $t$ is the time. The velocity field is often visualized as a vector field, where the vectors represent the velocity of the fluid at each point.

##### Streamlines, Streaklines, and Pathlines

Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines are three important concepts in fluid kinematics. They provide a way to visualize the motion of the fluid and can be used to understand the behavior of the fluid.

A streamline is a curve that is tangent to the velocity vector of the fluid at every point. It represents the path that a fluid particle would follow if it were to move along the streamline.

A streakline is the locus of particles that have passed through a particular spatial point in the past. It represents the path that a fluid particle would follow if it were to move along the streakline.

A pathline is the path that a fluid particle would follow if it were to move through the fluid. It represents the path that a fluid particle would follow if it were to move along the pathline.

These concepts are closely related and can be used to understand the behavior of the fluid. For example, if the streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines all coincide at a particular point, it indicates that the fluid is moving in a steady, uniform manner at that point.

In the next section, we will explore the principles of fluid dynamics, which describe the forces that cause the motion of the fluid.




#### 1.2a Conservation of Mass

The conservation of mass is a fundamental principle in fluid mechanics that states that the mass of a closed system remains constant, regardless of the processes acting inside the system. This principle is a direct consequence of the law of mass action, which states that the mass of a substance is directly proportional to its number of molecules or atoms.

In the context of fluid mechanics, the conservation of mass is often expressed mathematically as the continuity equation, which states that the mass flow rate into a volume is equal to the mass flow rate out of the volume, plus the rate of change of mass within the volume. This can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) = 0
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $t$ is the time, $\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity field, and $\nabla \cdot$ denotes the divergence operator.

The continuity equation is a powerful tool for analyzing fluid flow, as it allows us to relate the density and velocity of the fluid at different points in space and time. It is particularly useful in the study of incompressible fluid mechanics, where the density of the fluid is assumed to be constant.

In the context of numerical marine hydrodynamics, the conservation of mass is a crucial concept. It ensures that the total mass of the fluid remains constant as it is transported and transformed by the various processes acting in the ocean. This is particularly important in the study of ocean circulation, where the conservation of mass is used to track the movement of water masses and to understand the large-scale patterns of ocean currents.

In the next section, we will explore the other conservation laws that govern fluid flow, including the conservation of momentum and the conservation of energy. These laws, along with the conservation of mass, form the foundation of fluid mechanics and are essential tools for understanding the complex dynamics of fluid flow in the ocean.

#### 1.2b Conservation of Momentum

The conservation of momentum is another fundamental principle in fluid mechanics that is closely related to Newton's second law of motion. It states that the total momentum of a closed system remains constant, regardless of the processes acting inside the system. This principle is a direct consequence of the law of action and reaction, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

In the context of fluid mechanics, the conservation of momentum is often expressed mathematically as the momentum equation, which states that the rate of change of momentum of a fluid element is equal to the sum of the forces acting on it. This can be written as:

$$
\rho \frac{D \mathbf{v}}{D t} = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \rho \mathbf{g}
$$

where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid, $\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity field, $p$ is the pressure field, $\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity, $\mathbf{g}$ is the gravitational acceleration, and $\frac{D}{Dt}$ denotes the material derivative, which represents the rate of change following a fluid element. The operator $\nabla^2$ denotes the Laplacian operator, which represents the second spatial derivative.

The momentum equation is a powerful tool for analyzing fluid flow, as it allows us to relate the forces acting on the fluid to its motion and deformation. It is particularly useful in the study of incompressible fluid mechanics, where the density of the fluid is assumed to be constant.

In the context of numerical marine hydrodynamics, the conservation of momentum is a crucial concept. It ensures that the total momentum of the fluid remains constant as it is transported and transformed by the various processes acting in the ocean. This is particularly important in the study of ocean circulation, where the conservation of momentum is used to track the movement of water masses and to understand the large-scale patterns of ocean currents.

In the next section, we will explore the other conservation laws that govern fluid flow, including the conservation of energy and the conservation of potential vorticity. These laws, along with the conservation of mass and momentum, form the foundation of fluid mechanics and are essential tools for understanding the complex dynamics of fluid flow in the ocean.

#### 1.2c Conservation of Energy

The conservation of energy is a fundamental principle in fluid mechanics that is closely related to the first law of thermodynamics. It states that the total energy of a closed system remains constant, regardless of the processes acting inside the system. This principle is a direct consequence of the law of energy conservation, which states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or converted from one form to another.

In the context of fluid mechanics, the conservation of energy is often expressed mathematically as the energy equation, which states that the rate of change of energy of a fluid element is equal to the sum of the work done on it and the heat added to it. This can be written as:

$$
\rho \frac{D}{Dt} \left( \frac{v^2}{2} + gz + \frac{p}{\rho} \right) = -\nabla \cdot (\kappa \nabla T) - \mu \left( \frac{\partial v_i}{\partial x_j} + \frac{\partial v_j}{\partial x_i} - \frac{2}{3} \delta_{ij} \nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} \right)^2 + \zeta (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v})^2
$$

This is particularly important in the study of ocean circulation, where the conservation of energy is used to track the movement of water masses and to understand the large-scale patterns of ocean currents.

#### 1.2d Conservation of Potential Vorticity

The conservation of potential vorticity is a fundamental principle in fluid mechanics that is closely related to the geostrophic balance. It states that the potential vorticity of a fluid element remains constant, regardless of the processes acting inside the system. This principle is a direct consequence of the law of potential vorticity conservation, which states that potential vorticity cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or converted from one form to another.

In the context of fluid mechanics, the conservation of potential vorticity is often expressed mathematically as the potential vorticity equation, which states that the rate of change of potential vorticity of a fluid element is equal to the sum of the Coriolis force acting on it and the relative vorticity added to it. This can be written as:

$$
\frac{D}{Dt} \left( \frac{f}{H} \right) = \frac{1}{\rho} \nabla \times \left( \frac{\mathbf{v}}{H} \right) \times \nabla \left( \frac{p}{\rho} \right)
$$

where $f$ is the Coriolis parameter, $H$ is the depth of the fluid layer, $\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity of the fluid, $p$ is the pressure, and $\rho$ is the density of the fluid. The operator $\nabla \times$ denotes the curl operator, which represents the rotation of a vector field.

$$
\rho \frac{D \mathbf{v}}{D t} = -\nabla p + \mu \nabla^2 \mathbf{v} + \rho \mathbf{g}
$$
