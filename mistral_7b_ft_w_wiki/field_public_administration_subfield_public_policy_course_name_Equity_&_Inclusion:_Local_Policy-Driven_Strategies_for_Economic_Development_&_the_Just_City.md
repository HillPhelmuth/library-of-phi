# Equity & Inclusion: Local Policy-Driven Strategies for Economic Development & the Just City":


## Foreward

Welcome to "Equity & Inclusion: Local Policy-Driven Strategies for Economic Development & the Just City". This book aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex and interconnected issues of equity, inclusion, and economic development in the context of the just city. As we delve into these topics, it is important to keep in mind the concept of inclusive management, as defined by Quick and Feldman.

Inclusive management, as we understand it, is a process that transcends dichotomies and engages boundaries. It is a process that recognizes the importance of diversity and representation, but also goes beyond these to address the deeper issues of participation and control. It is a process that is not limited by the either/or dichotomies of diversity or representation, but instead engages both through participation-oriented and inclusion-oriented strategies.

In the context of economic development and the just city, inclusive management is crucial. It is through inclusive management that we can create a city that is equitable and inclusive, where all members of the community have equal opportunities to participate and benefit from economic development. It is through inclusive management that we can ensure that the city is not just a physical space, but a living, breathing entity that is shaped by the diverse perspectives and needs of its inhabitants.

This book will explore the various aspects of inclusive management in the context of economic development and the just city. We will delve into the role of diversity and representation, the importance of participation and control, and the need to transcend dichotomies and engage boundaries. We will also explore the role of local policies in driving these strategies, and how these policies can be used to create a more equitable and inclusive city.

As we embark on this journey, it is important to remember that inclusive management is not just about creating policies and strategies. It is about creating a culture of inclusivity and equity, where all members of the community feel valued and respected. It is about creating a city where everyone has a voice and a place, and where economic development is not just about growth and profit, but about creating opportunities and improving the quality of life for all.

Thank you for joining us on this journey. Let's work together to create a more equitable and inclusive city for all.

### Subsection: 1.1a Introduction to Planning

Planning is a critical aspect of urban development and management. It is a systematic process that involves the creation of a plan or strategy to guide the development of a city or a specific area within it. The planning process is guided by a set of principles, policies, and objectives that are designed to achieve specific goals. These goals can range from improving the quality of life for residents to promoting economic development.

Planning is a complex and multifaceted process that involves a wide range of stakeholders. These include government agencies, community groups, businesses, and individuals. The planning process is iterative and involves a series of steps, including problem identification, analysis, planning, implementation, and evaluation.

#### 1.1a.1 Planning as a Theory

Planning is not just a practical activity; it also has a theoretical underpinning. Planning theories provide a framework for understanding the planning process and guide the development of planning strategies. These theories are based on various disciplines, including sociology, economics, psychology, and political science.

One of the most influential planning theories is the Rational Planning Model. This theory posits that planning is a rational process that involves the identification of problems, the development of alternatives, and the selection of the best alternative based on a set of criteria. The Rational Planning Model is often used in the public sector, where planners are required to make decisions that are in the best interest of the community.

Another important planning theory is the Advocacy Planning Model. This theory emphasizes the role of advocacy in the planning process. It suggests that planners should advocate for the interests of marginalized and disadvantaged groups in the community. The Advocacy Planning Model is often used in the private sector, where planners are required to represent the interests of their clients.

#### 1.1a.2 Planning as a Practice

Planning is not just a theoretical activity; it also involves practical implementation. The planning process involves a series of steps, including problem identification, analysis, planning, implementation, and evaluation. Each of these steps requires a set of skills and tools.

Problem identification involves the recognition of a problem or a need for change. This can be done through observation, research, or consultation with stakeholders.

Analysis involves the examination of the problem to understand its causes and consequences. This can be done through various methods, including data collection, modeling, and simulation.

Planning involves the development of a strategy to address the problem. This can be done through the use of planning tools, such as maps, diagrams, and models.

Implementation involves the execution of the plan. This can be done through various methods, including policy-making, project management, and community engagement.

Evaluation involves the assessment of the effectiveness of the plan. This can be done through various methods, including monitoring, feedback, and impact assessment.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the planning process and explore each of these steps in more detail.




### Subsection: 1.1b History of Planning

The history of planning is as old as human civilization itself. Early human societies had to plan their settlements and activities to survive and thrive in their environment. However, it was not until the 19th and 20th centuries that planning became a formalized process and discipline.

#### 1.1b.1 Early Planning

The earliest known examples of planning can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. These societies had to plan their settlements and infrastructure to accommodate their growing populations and to protect themselves from natural disasters. For example, the Egyptians built their settlements along the Nile River to take advantage of the fertile land and to protect themselves from the annual flooding of the river.

#### 1.1b.2 Modern Planning

The modern planning process emerged in the 19th and 20th centuries. The Industrial Revolution brought about rapid urbanization and the need for more systematic and organized planning. The first urban planning laws were enacted in the late 19th century, and the first urban planning departments were established in the early 20th century.

The planning process has evolved over time, and today it involves a wide range of techniques and tools. These include GIS (Geographic Information System), which is used to analyze and visualize spatial data, and A* (Artificial Intelligence), which is used to solve complex planning problems.

#### 1.1b.3 Planning as a Discipline

Planning is a multidisciplinary field that draws on principles and methods from various disciplines, including sociology, economics, psychology, and political science. The history of planning is closely tied to the development of these disciplines. For example, the Rational Planning Model, which is based on the principles of rational choice theory, emerged in the 1960s as a response to the perceived failures of urban renewal policies.

#### 1.1b.4 Planning and Social Justice

The history of planning is also closely tied to issues of social justice. The unequal distribution of resources and opportunities in cities has been a major concern for planners since the early 20th century. The concept of equity, which refers to fairness and equal access to resources and opportunities, has been a key principle in planning since its inception.

In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the need to address issues of equity and inclusion in the planning process. This has led to the development of new planning theories and strategies, such as the Equity Planning Model, which emphasizes the need to consider the needs and interests of marginalized and disadvantaged groups in the planning process.




### Subsection: 1.1c Planning Theories

Planning theories are the conceptual frameworks that guide the planning process. They provide a systematic approach to understanding and addressing complex planning problems. In this section, we will explore some of the key planning theories that have shaped the field of planning.

#### 1.1c.1 Rational Planning Model

The Rational Planning Model is one of the earliest and most influential planning theories. It is based on the principles of rational choice theory, which assumes that decision-makers act rationally to maximize their objectives. The Rational Planning Model posits that planners should follow a systematic process to make decisions. This process involves identifying the problem, gathering and analyzing information, evaluating alternatives, and making a decision.

The Rational Planning Model has been criticized for its assumptions of rationality and objectivity. Critics argue that it does not account for the political, social, and economic factors that often influence planning decisions. However, it remains a useful tool for understanding the planning process and for teaching students about the principles of rational decision-making.

#### 1.1c.2 Communicative Planning Model

The Communicative Planning Model is another influential planning theory. It emphasizes the importance of communication and collaboration in the planning process. This model assumes that planning is a social process that involves multiple stakeholders with different interests and values. It advocates for a participatory approach to planning, where all stakeholders have the opportunity to express their views and influence the planning process.

The Communicative Planning Model has been criticized for its idealistic assumptions and for its lack of practical guidance. However, it has been instrumental in promoting the principles of inclusivity and participation in planning.

#### 1.1c.3 Just City Planning

Just City Planning is a planning theory that focuses on creating equitable and inclusive cities. It is based on the principles of social justice and aims to address the systemic inequalities that exist in our cities. Just City Planning advocates for a participatory and collaborative approach to planning, where all members of the community have the opportunity to participate in decision-making processes.

Just City Planning recognizes the importance of addressing historical and systemic inequalities in the planning process. It calls for a critical examination of the power dynamics that shape planning decisions and for the inclusion of marginalized communities in the planning process.

#### 1.1c.4 Smart City Planning

Smart City Planning is a planning theory that focuses on the use of technology and data to improve the efficiency and sustainability of cities. It involves the use of sensors, data analytics, and other technologies to collect and analyze data about the city and its inhabitants. This data is then used to inform planning decisions and to improve the quality of life for city residents.

Smart City Planning has been criticized for its potential to exacerbate existing inequalities and for its reliance on technology solutions to complex social and economic problems. However, it has the potential to improve the efficiency and sustainability of cities, if implemented in a way that is inclusive and equitable.

In the next section, we will explore how these planning theories are applied in practice.




### Subsection: 1.2a The Planning Process

The planning process is a systematic approach to addressing complex problems. It involves a series of steps that guide decision-makers through the process of identifying, analyzing, and solving problems. The planning process is not a linear process, but rather a cyclical one, where decisions are continually reviewed and revised in light of new information and changing circumstances.

#### 1.2a.1 The Planning Process in Theory

The planning process can be understood through various theoretical lenses. For instance, the Rational Planning Model posits that planners should follow a systematic process to make decisions. This process involves identifying the problem, gathering and analyzing information, evaluating alternatives, and making a decision. The Communicative Planning Model, on the other hand, emphasizes the importance of communication and collaboration in the planning process. It assumes that planning is a social process that involves multiple stakeholders with different interests and values.

#### 1.2a.2 The Planning Process in Practice

In practice, the planning process is often more complex and messy than these theoretical models suggest. Planners often have to navigate a multitude of competing interests, limited resources, and uncertain futures. They often have to make decisions under conditions of uncertainty and incomplete information. This is where the concept of planning as practice comes into play.

Planning as practice is a way of understanding and approaching the planning process that emphasizes the practical aspects of planning. It is concerned with how planners actually plan, rather than how they should plan according to theoretical models. It recognizes the importance of context, culture, and power in shaping the planning process. It also acknowledges the role of learning and adaptation in the planning process.

#### 1.2a.3 The Planning Process and Equity & Inclusion

The planning process plays a crucial role in promoting equity and inclusion in urban development. Equity and inclusion are fundamental principles that guide the planning process. They are about ensuring that all members of the community have equal access to resources and opportunities, and that their voices are heard and valued in the planning process.

The planning process can promote equity and inclusion by involving all stakeholders in the planning process, by considering the needs and interests of marginalized and disadvantaged groups, and by implementing policies and programs that address systemic inequalities and exclusions. However, achieving equity and inclusion in the planning process is not without challenges. It requires a commitment to inclusivity, participation, and accountability, as well as a willingness to challenge the status quo and to learn from past mistakes.




### Subsection: 1.2b Planning Tools and Techniques

Planning tools and techniques are essential for the effective implementation of planning strategies. They provide a structured approach to problem-solving and decision-making, and help to ensure that planning processes are efficient and effective. In this section, we will explore some of the key planning tools and techniques that are used in the planning process.

#### 1.2b.1 GIS (Geographic Information System)

GIS is a powerful tool that is used to collect, store, analyze, and visualize spatial data. It allows planners to analyze patterns and trends in data, and to make informed decisions based on this information. GIS can be used to create maps, perform spatial analysis, and to visualize data in a variety of ways. It is particularly useful for planning at the local level, where planners need to understand the spatial relationships between different elements of a community.

#### 1.2b.2 SWOT Analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats)

SWOT analysis is a strategic planning tool that is used to identify and analyze the internal and external factors that affect an organization or a project. It involves identifying the strengths and weaknesses of an organization, and the opportunities and threats that it faces. This information can then be used to develop strategies that leverage the strengths of the organization, address its weaknesses, and take advantage of opportunities while mitigating threats.

#### 1.2b.3 PEST Analysis (Political, Economic, Social, Technological)

PEST analysis is a strategic planning tool that is used to analyze the external environment in which an organization operates. It involves identifying and analyzing the political, economic, social, and technological factors that affect an organization. This information can then be used to develop strategies that respond to these factors, and to anticipate and mitigate potential risks.

#### 1.2b.4 Lean Product Development

Lean product development is a planning technique that is used to develop products in a way that minimizes waste and maximizes value. It involves identifying and eliminating non-value-adding activities, and focusing on activities that add value to the product. This approach can be applied to planning processes, helping planners to focus on activities that add value to the planning process, and to eliminate activities that do not.

### Subsection: 1.2c Planning Ethics

Planning ethics is a critical aspect of urban planning that ensures the fair and equitable distribution of resources and opportunities within a community. It is a set of principles and values that guide planners in their decision-making processes, and help them to address the complex ethical issues that arise in planning.

#### 1.2c.1 Ethical Principles in Planning

There are several ethical principles that guide planning practice. These include:

- **Equity**: This principle emphasizes the fair distribution of resources and opportunities among all members of a community. It requires planners to consider the needs and interests of all community members, and to ensure that they are treated fairly and equally.

- **Sustainability**: This principle emphasizes the need to balance the needs of the present and future generations. It requires planners to consider the long-term impacts of their decisions on the environment, the economy, and society.

- **Participation**: This principle emphasizes the importance of involving all community members in the planning process. It requires planners to engage in meaningful dialogue with community members, and to consider their views and concerns in their decision-making processes.

- **Transparency**: This principle emphasizes the need for openness and transparency in planning processes. It requires planners to communicate their decisions and the reasons for these decisions in a clear and transparent manner.

- **Accountability**: This principle emphasizes the need for planners to take responsibility for their decisions and their impacts. It requires planners to be accountable for their actions, and to be willing to address any negative impacts that their decisions may have on the community.

#### 1.2c.2 Ethical Dilemmas in Planning

Despite the existence of ethical principles, planners often face ethical dilemmas that challenge their ability to act in accordance with these principles. These dilemmas can arise from conflicts between different ethical principles, or from the need to balance the interests of different stakeholders.

For example, a planner may face a dilemma when trying to balance the needs of the present and future generations. On one hand, there may be a need to address the immediate needs of the present generation, such as providing affordable housing or creating jobs. On the other hand, there may be a need to preserve resources for future generations, such as protecting natural resources or reducing carbon emissions.

Similarly, a planner may face a dilemma when trying to balance the interests of different stakeholders. For example, a proposed development may benefit some community members, but harm others. The planner may face a dilemma about whether to approve the development, and how to address the concerns of those who may be harmed.

#### 1.2c.3 Ethical Decision-Making in Planning

To address ethical dilemmas, planners use a variety of decision-making techniques. These include:

- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: This technique involves weighing the costs and benefits of a proposed action. It requires planners to consider the potential impacts of their decisions on different stakeholders, and to balance these impacts against the potential benefits.

- **Moral Reasoning**: This technique involves using ethical principles to guide decision-making. It requires planners to consider the ethical implications of their decisions, and to make decisions that are consistent with their ethical principles.

- **Stakeholder Analysis**: This technique involves identifying and analyzing the interests and concerns of different stakeholders. It requires planners to consider the perspectives of different stakeholders, and to find ways to address their concerns in a fair and equitable manner.

In conclusion, planning ethics is a critical aspect of urban planning that helps to ensure the fair and equitable distribution of resources and opportunities within a community. It requires planners to navigate a complex set of ethical principles and dilemmas, and to use a variety of decision-making techniques to address these challenges.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the complex and ever-evolving landscape of urbanization and globalization. As our world becomes increasingly interconnected, the impact of these two forces on cities and their inhabitants is profound. The rise and fall of the industrial city serve as a case study for understanding the challenges and opportunities presented by urbanization and globalization.

The industrial city, a product of the 19th and 20th centuries, was a hub of economic activity and innovation. It was a symbol of progress and modernity, attracting people from all walks of life. However, as we will explore in this chapter, the industrial city also faced significant challenges, including social and economic inequality, environmental degradation, and the displacement of communities.

As we navigate through the complexities of urbanization and globalization, we will draw lessons from the rise and fall of the industrial city. These lessons will inform our understanding of the current urban landscape and guide us in developing local policy-driven strategies for economic development and the just city.

This chapter will be divided into several sections, each focusing on a different aspect of urbanization and globalization. We will explore the historical context of the industrial city, its impact on society and the environment, and the lessons we can learn from its rise and fall. We will also discuss the current state of urbanization and globalization, and the challenges and opportunities they present for cities and their inhabitants.

As we journey through this chapter, we will also consider the role of local policy in shaping the urban landscape. We will examine how local policies can be used to address the challenges of urbanization and globalization, and promote equity and inclusion in our cities.

Join us as we explore the complex and fascinating world of urbanization and globalization, and the lessons they hold for creating a more equitable and inclusive future for all.




### Subsection: 2.1a Industrialization and Urbanization

The Industrial Revolution, which began in the late 18th century, marked a significant turning point in human history. It was a period of rapid technological advancement and economic growth, driven by the rise of modern industry. This period also saw a massive urbanization, as people migrated from rural communities to urban areas in search of new opportunities.

#### The Rise of the Industrial City

The Industrial Revolution led to the rise of new great cities, first in Europe and then in other regions. These cities were characterized by a concentration of industry and commerce, and they became hubs of economic activity and innovation. Manchester, for instance, grew from a population of 10,000 in 1717 to 2.3 million by 1911.

The growth of these industrial cities was fueled by the division of labor, as more and more people were employed in factories and other industrial settings. This led to a shift in the economic roles of men and women. While men were typically employed in paid labor jobs outside the home, women were confined to unpaid household work. This shift had a profound impact on the status of women, as we will explore in the next section.

#### The Impact of Industrialization on Women and Family Life

The Industrial Revolution and capitalism generally had a significant impact on the status of women. Alice Clark, in her book "The Working Life of Women in the Seventeenth Century," argues that the arrival of capitalism in 17th-century England lowered the status of women as they lost much of their economic importance. In the pre-industrial era, women played a vital role in production, contributing to the household economy. However, as capitalism expanded, there was a division of labor, with men taking paid labor jobs outside the home and women reduced to unpaid household work.

However, Ivy Pinchbeck offers a more positive interpretation, arguing that capitalism created the conditions for women's emancipation. Tilly and Scott have emphasized the continuity in the status of women, finding three stages in English history. In the pre-industrial era, production was mostly for home use, and women produced much of the needs of the households. The second stage was the "family wage economy" of the 19th century, where women were confined to the home and dependent on their husbands' wages. The third stage, brought about by capitalism, was the rise of the "female breadwinner" family, where women were employed outside the home and contributed to the household income.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the lessons we can learn from the rise and fall of the industrial city, and how these lessons can inform our understanding of urbanization and globalization in the 21st century.




### Subsection: 2.1b The Rise of the Industrial City

The rise of the industrial city was a direct result of the Industrial Revolution. As the demand for labor increased in the factories, people began to migrate from rural areas to urban centers in search of employment opportunities. This led to the rapid growth of cities, transforming them from small, sleepy towns into bustling centers of industry and commerce.

#### The Impact of Urbanization

Urbanization had a profound impact on society. It led to the concentration of people in urban areas, creating a need for new infrastructure and services. This, in turn, led to the development of new industries, such as construction and services, which further fueled economic growth.

However, urbanization also brought about significant challenges. The rapid growth of cities led to overcrowding, poor living conditions, and the spread of diseases. The lack of proper sanitation and housing in these cities resulted in high mortality rates, particularly among the poor. This was a stark contrast to the rural areas, where people lived in smaller communities and had better access to fresh air and open spaces.

#### The Role of Policy

The rise of the industrial city also highlighted the importance of policy in shaping urban development. As cities grew, they faced increasing challenges in managing their resources and providing essential services to their residents. This led to the development of new policies and regulations to address these challenges.

For instance, the British Industrial Revolution saw the introduction of the New Poor Law, which aimed to provide relief to the poor while also preventing them from becoming a burden on the parish. This law, along with other policies introduced during the Industrial Revolution, played a crucial role in shaping the urban landscape of Britain.

#### The Role of Technology

The Industrial Revolution was also marked by significant technological advancements. The development of new machines and production techniques led to increased productivity and efficiency, driving economic growth. This also led to the rise of new industries, such as steel and chemical production, which further fueled urbanization.

However, these technological advancements also brought about significant changes in the labor market. The division of labor led to a shift in the economic roles of men and women, as we explored in the previous section. This, in turn, had a profound impact on society, leading to changes in social norms and values.

In conclusion, the rise of the industrial city was a complex phenomenon, shaped by a variety of factors, including policy, technology, and social changes.

### Subsection: 2.1c The Fall of the Industrial City

The fall of the industrial city was a gradual process that began in the late 19th century and continued through the 20th century. It was marked by the decline of traditional manufacturing industries, the rise of new industries, and the transformation of urban spaces.

#### The Decline of Traditional Manufacturing Industries

The decline of traditional manufacturing industries, such as textiles and steel, was a major factor in the fall of the industrial city. These industries were heavily reliant on labor-intensive production methods, which were increasingly being replaced by more efficient and automated processes. This led to a decline in employment opportunities and a decrease in the demand for urban spaces dedicated to manufacturing.

#### The Rise of New Industries

The fall of the industrial city also saw the rise of new industries, such as information technology and services. These industries required different types of urban spaces, with a greater emphasis on knowledge-based activities and services. This shift led to the development of new urban areas, such as technology parks and business districts, which were often located on the outskirts of cities.

#### The Transformation of Urban Spaces

The fall of the industrial city also brought about significant changes in urban spaces. As traditional manufacturing industries declined, many urban areas became abandoned or underutilized. This led to the redevelopment of these spaces, often through the conversion of industrial buildings into residential, commercial, or cultural spaces. This process, known as adaptive reuse, has been a key factor in the transformation of urban spaces in the post-industrial era.

#### The Role of Policy

The fall of the industrial city also highlighted the importance of policy in shaping urban development. As cities faced the challenges of declining industries and changing urban spaces, they were forced to adapt and develop new policies and regulations. This included policies aimed at promoting economic development, such as tax incentives and subsidies, as well as policies aimed at addressing social and environmental issues, such as affordable housing and sustainability.

#### The Impact of Globalization

The fall of the industrial city was also influenced by globalization, which led to increased competition and changes in the global economy. This, in turn, led to the relocation of industries and the rise of new industries, further transforming urban spaces and challenging traditional urban development models.

In conclusion, the fall of the industrial city was a complex and multifaceted process, shaped by a variety of factors including technological advancements, changes in industry, and global economic trends. It has had a profound impact on urban development and continues to shape the cities of today and tomorrow.

## Chapter: Chapter 3: The Role of Local Government in Economic Development

### Introduction

The role of local government in economic development is a critical aspect of creating a just city. As we have seen in the previous chapters, urbanization and globalization have brought about significant changes in the economic landscape, leading to both opportunities and challenges for cities. In this chapter, we will delve into the specific strategies and policies that local governments can implement to promote economic development and create a more equitable and inclusive city.

Local governments play a crucial role in shaping the economic landscape of a city. They are responsible for creating a conducive environment for businesses to thrive, providing essential services to their citizens, and addressing issues of equity and inclusion. As such, their policies and decisions have a direct impact on the economic development of a city.

In this chapter, we will explore the various ways in which local governments can promote economic development. We will discuss the importance of creating a business-friendly environment, providing affordable housing, and investing in infrastructure and public services. We will also examine the role of local governments in promoting diversity and inclusion, and how they can address issues of economic inequality.

Furthermore, we will also look at the challenges faced by local governments in their efforts to promote economic development. These include limited resources, competing interests, and the complexities of urban planning and development. We will discuss how local governments can navigate these challenges and implement effective policies and strategies to promote economic development.

Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of local government in economic development and the just city. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the various factors that influence economic development at the local level and the strategies that local governments can use to create a more equitable and inclusive city. 




### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the intersection of urban social movements and new space claims in the United States. Urban social movements have been a driving force for change in American cities, advocating for equity and inclusion in various aspects of urban life. These movements have been instrumental in shaping the policies and practices of local governments, and have played a crucial role in promoting economic development and creating just cities.

We will begin by examining the history and evolution of urban social movements in the United States, from the civil rights movement to the more recent Black Lives Matter movement. We will also explore the role of these movements in shaping urban policies and practices, and their impact on economic development and the creation of just cities.

Next, we will delve into the concept of new space claims, which refers to the process of claiming and reclaiming urban spaces for marginalized communities. This includes the creation of new spaces, such as community gardens and affordable housing, as well as the reclamation of existing spaces, such as abandoned buildings and vacant lots. We will discuss the various strategies and tactics used by urban social movements to make these new space claims, and their implications for equity and inclusion in American cities.

Finally, we will examine the challenges and opportunities presented by the intersection of urban social movements and new space claims. This includes the potential for conflict and collaboration between different groups and interests, as well as the potential for creating more equitable and inclusive cities. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a deeper understanding of the role of urban social movements and new space claims in shaping the future of American cities.

### Section: 3.1 U.S. Urban Social Movements and New Space Claims:

### Subsection (optional): 3.1a Origins of Urban Social Movements

Urban social movements have played a crucial role in shaping the policies and practices of local governments in the United States. These movements have been instrumental in promoting equity and inclusion in various aspects of urban life, and have been a driving force for change in American cities.

The origins of urban social movements can be traced back to the civil rights movement of the 1960s. This movement was a response to the systemic discrimination and segregation faced by African Americans in the United States. The civil rights movement was a pivotal moment in American history, as it brought attention to the unequal treatment of marginalized communities and sparked a movement for change.

One of the key strategies used by the civil rights movement was nonviolent direct action, which involved peaceful protests and demonstrations to bring attention to social and economic injustices. This strategy was used to challenge discriminatory policies and practices, and to demand equal treatment for all individuals.

The civil rights movement also played a crucial role in shaping urban policies and practices. The passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were direct results of the movement's efforts. These laws aimed to address discrimination and segregation in various aspects of urban life, including housing, education, and employment.

In addition to the civil rights movement, other urban social movements have emerged in the United States, each with its own unique origins and goals. These include the feminist movement, the LGBTQ+ movement, and the environmental justice movement.

The feminist movement, which began in the 1960s, aimed to address the unequal treatment of women in society. This movement fought for women's rights to education, employment, and equal pay. It also challenged traditional gender roles and advocated for women's autonomy and empowerment.

The LGBTQ+ movement, which began in the 1960s and 1970s, aimed to address the discrimination and marginalization faced by lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals. This movement fought for equal rights and protections for the LGBTQ+ community, including marriage equality and anti-discrimination laws.

The environmental justice movement, which began in the 1980s, aimed to address the unequal distribution of environmental hazards and benefits in urban communities. This movement fought for the right of all individuals, regardless of race or socioeconomic status, to live in a healthy and safe environment.

These urban social movements have been instrumental in shaping urban policies and practices, and have played a crucial role in promoting equity and inclusion in American cities. Their efforts have led to significant progress in addressing social and economic injustices, and have paved the way for a more just and equitable future for all individuals.

### Section: 3.1 U.S. Urban Social Movements and New Space Claims:

### Subsection (optional): 3.1b Key Social Movements in U.S. Cities

The civil rights movement, feminist movement, and LGBTQ+ movement are just a few of the key social movements that have shaped urban spaces in the United States. These movements have not only brought attention to social and economic injustices, but have also led to policy changes and the creation of new spaces that promote equity and inclusion.

One of the most significant outcomes of these movements has been the creation of new spaces in urban areas. These spaces, often referred to as "new spaces," have been claimed by marginalized communities as a means of asserting their presence and demanding equal treatment. New spaces can take many forms, from physical spaces such as community centers and parks, to virtual spaces such as online platforms and social media.

The creation of new spaces has been a powerful tool for marginalized communities in their fight for equity and inclusion. These spaces allow for the expression of diverse perspectives and the formation of strong social networks. They also provide a platform for marginalized communities to voice their concerns and advocate for change.

However, the creation of new spaces has also faced challenges. Many marginalized communities face barriers to accessing and utilizing these spaces, such as limited resources and discrimination. Additionally, the creation of new spaces can also lead to conflicts with existing power structures and institutions.

Despite these challenges, new spaces have played a crucial role in promoting equity and inclusion in urban areas. They have allowed marginalized communities to claim their rightful place in society and have been a driving force for change in American cities. As we continue to address issues of equity and inclusion, it is important to recognize the role of new spaces in creating a more just and equitable urban landscape.


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the history and impact of urban social movements and new space claims in the United States. We have seen how these movements have played a crucial role in shaping the economic development and social fabric of American cities. From the civil rights movement to the feminist movement, these movements have fought for equity and inclusion, and have successfully brought about policy changes that have improved the lives of marginalized communities.

We have also discussed the concept of new space claims, where marginalized communities have asserted their right to occupy and utilize urban spaces that were previously denied to them. This has led to the creation of new spaces that cater to the specific needs and interests of these communities, promoting diversity and inclusivity in the city.

As we move forward, it is important for local governments to continue supporting and promoting these movements and new space claims. By doing so, we can create more equitable and inclusive cities that provide opportunities for all members of the community.

### Subsection: 4.1b Stakeholder Engagement and Participation

Stakeholder engagement and participation are crucial components of community development at the bargaining table. As discussed in the previous section, stakeholder engagement is the process by which an organization involves people who may be affected by the decisions it makes or can influence the implementation of its decisions. In the context of community development, stakeholders can include community members, local organizations, government agencies, and other entities with a vested interest in the development of the community.

#### The Importance of Stakeholder Engagement and Participation

Stakeholder engagement and participation are essential for several reasons. First, they ensure that the needs and concerns of all stakeholders are considered in the decision-making process. This is particularly important in community development, where the decisions made can have a significant impact on the lives of community members. By involving stakeholders in the decision-making process, we can ensure that the decisions made are equitable and inclusive, and that they address the needs and concerns of all stakeholders.

Second, stakeholder engagement and participation can lead to more effective and sustainable solutions. When stakeholders are involved in the decision-making process, they are more likely to support and implement the decisions made. This can lead to more effective and sustainable solutions, as stakeholders have a vested interest in the outcomes and are more likely to work towards their implementation.

#### Challenges and Opportunities in Stakeholder Engagement and Participation

Despite its importance, stakeholder engagement and participation can be challenging. One of the main challenges is identifying and engaging all relevant stakeholders. In complex communities, there may be a large number of stakeholders with diverse interests and concerns. Identifying and engaging all of these stakeholders can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process.

However, there are also opportunities in stakeholder engagement and participation. For example, involving stakeholders in the decision-making process can lead to a better understanding of the issues at hand and potential solutions. This can lead to more informed and effective decision-making.

#### Strategies for Effective Stakeholder Engagement and Participation

To address the challenges and maximize the opportunities in stakeholder engagement and participation, it is important to have effective strategies in place. These strategies should aim to ensure that all stakeholders are identified and engaged in a meaningful way. They should also aim to create a safe and inclusive space for stakeholders to express their concerns and contribute to the decision-making process.

One strategy for effective stakeholder engagement and participation is the use of multistakeholder governance. This approach involves the establishment of a governance structure that includes representatives from all stakeholder groups. This can help to ensure that all stakeholders have a voice in the decision-making process and can work towards mutually beneficial solutions.

Another strategy is the use of stakeholder engagement tools and frameworks. These tools and frameworks can help to guide the stakeholder engagement process and ensure that all stakeholders are considered in a systematic and equitable manner. For example, the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) requires stakeholder engagement as part of its sustainability reporting framework. This can help to ensure that stakeholder engagement is a key component of community development at the bargaining table.

In conclusion, stakeholder engagement and participation are crucial for effective community development at the bargaining table. By involving stakeholders in the decision-making process, we can ensure that the decisions made are equitable and inclusive, and that they address the needs and concerns of all stakeholders. However, it is important to have effective strategies in place to address the challenges and maximize the opportunities in stakeholder engagement and participation.





### Subsection: 4.1c Negotiation and Bargaining Strategies

Negotiation and bargaining are crucial skills in community development, particularly at the bargaining table. These skills are essential for resolving conflicts, reaching agreements, and achieving mutually beneficial outcomes. In this section, we will explore some of the key negotiation and bargaining strategies that can be used in community development.

#### The Importance of Negotiation and Bargaining Strategies

Negotiation and bargaining strategies are important for several reasons. First, they provide a structured and systematic approach to resolving conflicts and reaching agreements. This can be particularly useful in complex community development projects, where there may be multiple stakeholders with diverse interests and concerns. By using negotiation and bargaining strategies, we can ensure that all stakeholders have an opportunity to voice their concerns and that these concerns are addressed in a fair and equitable manner.

Second, negotiation and bargaining strategies can help to build trust and understanding between stakeholders. By engaging in constructive dialogue and negotiation, stakeholders can gain a better understanding of each other's perspectives and concerns. This can lead to more effective and sustainable solutions, as stakeholders are more likely to support and implement decisions that they have been involved in making.

#### Key Negotiation and Bargaining Strategies

There are several key negotiation and bargaining strategies that can be used in community development. These include:

- **Principled negotiation**: This strategy is based on the principles of fairness, honesty, and mutual respect. It involves identifying and addressing the underlying interests and needs of all stakeholders, rather than just their stated positions. This can lead to more creative and sustainable solutions, as it encourages stakeholders to think outside the box and consider the needs of all parties.

- **Interest-based negotiation**: This strategy focuses on identifying and addressing the underlying interests and needs of all stakeholders. It involves asking "why" to understand the underlying motivations and concerns of each stakeholder. This can lead to more effective and sustainable solutions, as it encourages stakeholders to work together to address the root causes of conflicts and concerns.

- **Positional bargaining**: This strategy involves taking a hard-line approach and making demands based on one's own position. It is often used in situations where there is a power imbalance between the parties. While this strategy can be effective in certain situations, it can also lead to conflict and a lack of trust between stakeholders.

- **Concession-making**: This strategy involves making concessions or compromises in order to reach an agreement. It is often used in situations where there are conflicting interests and concerns. However, it is important to consider the optimum time to make a concession, the cost of making the concession, and the impact of the concession on the overall agreement.

#### Conclusion

Negotiation and bargaining strategies are essential tools in community development. They provide a structured and systematic approach to resolving conflicts and reaching agreements, and can help to build trust and understanding between stakeholders. By using these strategies, we can ensure that all stakeholders have an opportunity to voice their concerns and that these concerns are addressed in a fair and equitable manner.

We have also discussed the role of local policies in promoting equity and inclusion, and how they can be used as tools for economic development. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the topic of equity and inclusion plans, which are crucial for implementing these policies at the local level.

Equity and inclusion plans are strategic documents that outline the goals, strategies, and actions of a city or community to promote equity and inclusion. They are developed through a collaborative process that involves community members, stakeholders, and government officials. These plans serve as a roadmap for addressing systemic issues and promoting fairness and equality in all aspects of city life.

In this chapter, we will discuss the importance of equity and inclusion plans, their development process, and their role in promoting economic development. We will also explore case studies of successful equity and inclusion plans from different cities and communities, and the lessons learned from their implementation. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the key components of equity and inclusion plans and how they can be used to create more equitable and inclusive cities.




### Section: 5.1 Equity & Inclusion Plans:

Equity and inclusion plans are essential tools for promoting equity and inclusion in a just city. These plans outline the goals, strategies, and actions of a city or community to address systemic issues and promote fairness and equality in all aspects of city life. In this section, we will explore the importance of equity and inclusion plans, their development process, and their role in promoting economic development.

#### 5.1a Understanding Equity and Inclusion

Before delving into the specifics of equity and inclusion plans, it is crucial to understand the concepts of equity and inclusion. Equity refers to fairness and justice in the distribution of resources and opportunities. It recognizes that certain groups, such as marginalized communities, have been historically disadvantaged and seeks to address these disparities. Inclusion, on the other hand, focuses on creating a sense of belonging and participation for all members of a community. It recognizes that everyone has unique needs and abilities and seeks to accommodate them in all aspects of city life.

In the context of education, equity and inclusion have been widely discussed and implemented. The United Nations' Target 4 Goals, for example, emphasize the importance of education for all, including marginalized students. The capabilities approach, introduced by Martha Nussbaum and Amartya Sen, supports the idea that each learner should be offered the freedom to choose from alternative ways of learning and to do it as a shared experience with their peers. This approach recognizes the importance of inclusivity in education and the need for accommodations for students with diverse needs.

#### 5.1b The Role of Equity and Inclusion Plans in Promoting Economic Development

Equity and inclusion plans play a crucial role in promoting economic development in a just city. By addressing systemic issues and promoting fairness and equality, these plans create a more inclusive and equitable environment for all members of the community. This, in turn, can lead to increased economic opportunities and growth.

For example, by promoting equity and inclusion in education, these plans can help marginalized students reach their full potential and contribute to the economic development of the city. By providing accommodations and support for students with diverse needs, these plans can also help create a more inclusive learning environment, which can lead to increased academic achievement and future economic opportunities.

#### 5.1c Case Studies of Successful Equity and Inclusion Plans

To further illustrate the importance and effectiveness of equity and inclusion plans, let us examine some case studies of successful implementation. One such example is the city of Portland, Oregon, which has implemented an equity and inclusion plan that focuses on addressing systemic issues and promoting fairness and equality in all aspects of city life. This plan has led to increased economic opportunities for marginalized communities, such as people of color and low-income residents, and has also improved overall economic growth for the city.

Another successful example is the city of San Francisco, which has implemented an equity and inclusion plan that focuses on promoting affordable housing and economic opportunities for marginalized communities. This plan has led to the creation of affordable housing units and job training programs for low-income residents, resulting in improved economic stability and opportunities for these communities.

#### 5.1d Conclusion

In conclusion, equity and inclusion plans are crucial for promoting equity and inclusion in a just city. By addressing systemic issues and promoting fairness and equality, these plans can lead to increased economic opportunities and growth. The case studies of Portland and San Francisco demonstrate the effectiveness of these plans in creating more equitable and inclusive cities. As we continue to strive for a more just and equitable society, it is essential to prioritize the development and implementation of equity and inclusion plans at the local level.

# Debt-to-equity ratio

## Example

General Electric Co # Personal equity plan

A personal equity plan (PEP) was a form of tax-privileged investment account in the United Kingdom, available between 1986 and 1999.

## History

The plans were introduced by Nigel Lawson in the 1986 budget to encourage equity ownership among the wider population. PEPs were allowed to contain collective investments such as unit trusts. The "single company PEP", which was allowed to contain shares of a single company, was introduced in 1992. PEPs were superseded by individual savings accounts in 1999, and remaining accounts were converted to individual savings accounts in 2008.

## Types and privileges

Growth in a PEP was free from capital gains tax within the fund and on encashment. Income was free from income tax. When introduced in 1986, the fund was limited to £2,400 (annual allowance), but later increased to two types of PEP: the "general PEP" with an annual allowance of £6,000 and the "single company PEP" with an annual allowance of £3,000.

Investments in a general PEP were limited to qualifying collective investments. Qualifying investments had at least half of their assets invested in the UK, later extended to the European Union. The qualification rule for existing PEPs was removed in 2001. 

Single company PEPs could be invested in one company only. One way they could be used was to hold windfall shares received by members from mutual bodies when they became listed companies.

## Evolution

Beginning 6 April 1999, the Advanced Corporation Tax relief on share dividends received on a PEP was halved, partially ending their tax-exempt status. From 6 April 2004 all relief on dividends was removed, although no additional tax at the higher rate was due where otherwise it might have been. Gains on capital, and all other forms of income such as cash interest and bond income, remained tax-free. Significant cash holdings for any length of time were discouraged by HM Revenue and Customs; they would be subject to tax on encashment.

Moreover, equity and inclusion plans can also help attract and retain businesses and talent in the community. By promoting diversity and inclusion, these plans can create a more welcoming and supportive environment for businesses and individuals, leading to economic growth and development.

#### 5.1c Evaluating the Impact of Equity Plans

Evaluating the impact of equity plans is crucial for understanding their effectiveness and identifying areas for improvement. This can be done through various methods, such as surveys, data analysis, and community feedback.

Surveys can be used to gather feedback from community members on the effectiveness of equity plans. This can help identify areas of concern and areas where improvements can be made.

## Chapter 6: Equity & Inclusion in Economic Development:




### Introduction

In this chapter, we will delve into the complex and often contentious topic of race and gender-based approaches to equity. As we have seen in previous chapters, equity and inclusion are crucial components of a just city and a thriving economy. However, the intersection of race and gender with these concepts presents unique challenges and opportunities.

The United States has a long history of systemic racism and sexism, which have resulted in significant disparities in economic opportunities and outcomes for people of color and women. These disparities are not just social issues, but also economic ones. For instance, the gender wage gap, where women earn less than men for the same work, costs the U.S. economy billions of dollars each year. Similarly, racial disparities in education, employment, and wealth creation have significant economic implications.

In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the need to address these issues at the policy level. Local governments, in particular, have been at the forefront of this effort. They have implemented a range of policies and programs aimed at promoting equity and inclusion for people of color and women. These efforts have been driven by the recognition that economic development and the creation of a just city cannot be achieved without addressing these systemic disparities.

In this chapter, we will explore these race and gender-based approaches to equity in detail. We will examine the rationale behind these policies, their implementation, and their impact. We will also discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with these efforts, and offer recommendations for future action.

As we navigate through this complex and sensitive topic, it is important to keep in mind that our goal is not to take sides or to make any factual claims or opinions without proper citations or context to support them. Instead, our aim is to provide a comprehensive and balanced overview of the current state of race and gender-based approaches to equity, and to stimulate thought and discussion on this important issue.




### Subsection: 6.1a Intersectionality and Equity

Intersectionality is a concept that has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in the context of race and gender-based approaches to equity. It is a theory that recognizes the interconnectedness of different forms of oppression, such as race, gender, and social class, and how they interact to create unique experiences of discrimination and marginalization.

The case of "DeGraffenreid vs. General Motors" provides a clear example of how intersectionality can be overlooked in legal proceedings. In this case, the court's analysis of race and gender discrimination was conducted separately, thereby missing the intersectional nature of the discrimination faced by the plaintiffs. This case underscores the importance of considering intersectionality in legal proceedings and policy-making.

Another case, "Maivan Lam v. University of Hawai'i", highlights the challenges faced by individuals who experience multiple forms of discrimination. In this case, the university's decision to cancel the search for a director position twice, when the best candidate was a woman of color, illustrates the complex interplay between race and gender discrimination. This case also underscores the need for policies and programs that address the unique challenges faced by individuals who experience multiple forms of discrimination.

Intersectionality is also a key concept in the study of social inequality. It recognizes that individuals can experience multiple forms of discrimination and marginalization, and that these experiences are often interconnected. For instance, a black woman may experience discrimination based on her race and gender, and these experiences may be interconnected in complex ways. This interconnectedness can create unique challenges and opportunities that are not captured by a focus on race or gender in isolation.

In the context of economic development and the just city, intersectionality is a crucial concept. It recognizes that policies and programs aimed at promoting equity and inclusion must address the unique challenges faced by individuals who experience multiple forms of discrimination. This requires a nuanced understanding of the interconnectedness of different forms of oppression, and a commitment to policies and programs that address these interconnected challenges.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the concept of intersectionality and its implications for race and gender-based approaches to equity. We will also explore strategies for addressing intersectionality in policy-making and program design.




### Subsection: 6.1b Racial and Gender Disparities

Racial and gender disparities are pervasive in our society, affecting every aspect of life, including education, employment, and healthcare. These disparities are often interconnected, with race and gender intersecting to create unique experiences of discrimination and marginalization.

#### 6.1b.1 Racial Disparities

Racial disparities are a significant aspect of social inequality. The intersection of race and gender creates varying perspectives, and focusing on just one variable does not serve as the basis of inclusion and diversity. The notion of all women being marginalized in the same way is false, as discrimination in the workplace is not a shared experience. The sole emphasis on gender hides the racial privilege of white women, and middle-class, college-educated women dominate the discourse and promote their interests. While this builds some degree of solidarity, it ignores the legacy of racism in society. The lack of understanding of race with regard to gender-technology relationships explains the underrepresentation of women in technology occupations. For instance, for Black women, there are more barriers when it comes to entering the industry.

A 2021 study identified that women of color are particularly underrepresented: in terms of computer science majors in the United States, 5% are Asian women, 2% are Latina women, and 2% are Black women. A 2022 study found that community college plays a key role in incorporating more women into STEM majors, due to its accessibility and opportunities for upward transfer into higher education and the workforce.

#### 6.1b.2 Gender Disparities

Gender disparities are also a significant aspect of social inequality. Women are underrepresented in many fields, particularly in technology and computing. For instance, in 2018, only 1% of the 28,884 bachelor’s degrees in computer science were awarded to Black women. People have stated that not only is there a lack of Black women in classrooms and technology spaces, but they are also understudied and ignored as research samples in relevant studies.

#### 6.1b.3 Intersectionality of Racial and Gender Disparities

The intersection of race and gender creates unique experiences of discrimination and marginalization. For instance, Black women face a double disadvantage in the workplace, experiencing both racial and gender discrimination. This intersectionality is often overlooked in policy-making and legal proceedings, as seen in the case of "DeGraffenreid vs. General Motors". The court's analysis of race and gender discrimination was conducted separately, thereby missing the intersectional nature of the discrimination faced by the plaintiffs.

In conclusion, racial and gender disparities are pervasive in our society, and their intersection creates unique experiences of discrimination and marginalization. Addressing these disparities requires a comprehensive approach that considers the interconnectedness of race and gender.




### Subsection: 6.1c Strategies for Addressing Race and Gender Inequities

Addressing race and gender inequities requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the root causes of these disparities. Here are some strategies that can be employed:

#### 6.1c.1 Inclusive Policies and Programs

Inclusive policies and programs are crucial in addressing race and gender inequities. These policies and programs should be designed to promote diversity and inclusion, and to ensure that all individuals, regardless of their race or gender, have equal opportunities to participate and succeed. For instance, policies can be put in place to promote diversity in hiring and promotion processes, and to ensure that all employees are treated fairly and equitably.

#### 6.1c.2 Education and Awareness

Education and awareness are powerful tools in addressing race and gender inequities. By educating individuals about the history and impact of racism and sexism, we can help to challenge and change harmful stereotypes and biases. Awareness campaigns can also be used to raise awareness about these issues and to promote understanding and empathy.

#### 6.1c.3 Community Engagement

Community engagement is another important strategy for addressing race and gender inequities. By involving community members in the process, we can ensure that the strategies and solutions developed are responsive to the needs and concerns of those who are most affected by these issues. This can also help to build trust and promote a sense of ownership and responsibility.

#### 6.1c.4 Data Collection and Analysis

Data collection and analysis are essential for understanding the nature and extent of race and gender inequities. By collecting and analyzing data, we can identify the areas where disparities exist, and develop targeted strategies to address them. This can also help to track progress and measure the effectiveness of interventions.

#### 6.1c.5 Collaboration and Partnership

Collaboration and partnership are key to addressing race and gender inequities. By working together, we can leverage the strengths and resources of different stakeholders, and develop more comprehensive and effective strategies. This can include partnerships between government agencies, businesses, community organizations, and academic institutions.

In conclusion, addressing race and gender inequities requires a comprehensive and collaborative approach. By employing these strategies, we can work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive society for all.

### Conclusion

This section will delve into the local policy-driven strategies that can be employed to promote environmental justice and equity in urban planning.

#### 7.1a Introduction to Environmental Justice

Environmental justice is a concept that has gained significant attention in recent years. It is a movement that seeks to address the disproportionate environmental burdens faced by marginalized communities, particularly those that are low-income, minority, or indigenous. These communities often bear the brunt of environmental hazards such as pollution, toxic waste, and climate change, while having limited access to environmental benefits such as parks and clean water.

The concept of environmental justice is rooted in the principles of equity and fairness. It recognizes that all individuals and communities have the right to a healthy and sustainable environment. It also acknowledges that environmental issues are not just about protecting the environment, but also about protecting the health and well-being of people, particularly those who are most vulnerable.

Environmental justice is not just about addressing the environmental impacts on communities, but also about addressing the social, economic, and political factors that contribute to these impacts. This includes issues of race, class, and power dynamics. For example, low-income communities and communities of color are often located near industrial sites, waste facilities, and other sources of pollution due to historical patterns of segregation and discrimination. This results in these communities bearing a disproportionate burden of environmental risks.

In the United States, there have been numerous examples of the state provisioning of environmental justice in multiple communities. For instance, the state of California has implemented policies to reduce pollution in disadvantaged communities, and has established the California Environmental Protection Agency to oversee these efforts. Similarly, the city of Portland, Oregon has implemented a comprehensive plan to address environmental justice, which includes policies related to land use, transportation, and waste management.

#### 7.1b Environmental Justice and Equity Planning Strategies

There are several strategies that can be employed to promote environmental justice and equity in urban planning. These include:

1. **Policy Interventions**: Local governments can implement policies that aim to reduce environmental inequalities. This can include policies that restrict the location of certain types of industries or facilities in disadvantaged communities, and policies that promote the provision of environmental benefits in these communities.

2. **Community Engagement**: Engaging with communities affected by environmental injustices is crucial in addressing these issues. This can involve involving these communities in decision-making processes, and ensuring that their voices are heard in policy discussions.

3. **Capacity Building**: Building the capacity of communities affected by environmental injustices can help them to advocate for their rights and to participate effectively in decision-making processes. This can involve providing training, resources, and support.

4. **Partnerships and Collaborations**: Collaborating with other stakeholders, such as non-governmental organizations, academic institutions, and private sector entities, can help to leverage resources and expertise to address environmental injustices.

5. **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Regularly monitoring and evaluating the impacts of environmental policies and programs can help to identify areas of concern and to inform future interventions.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into each of these strategies, providing examples of how they have been implemented in practice.

### Section: 7.1 Environmental Justice & Equity Planning:

Environmental justice and equity planning are crucial for creating a just city. They are about ensuring that all members of a society have equal access to environmental benefits and are not disproportionately burdened by environmental risks. This section will delve into the local policy-driven strategies that can be employed to promote environmental justice and equity in urban planning.

#### 7.1b Environmental Inequalities and Disparities

Environmental inequalities and disparities are a significant aspect of environmental justice. They refer to the unequal distribution of environmental benefits and burdens among different communities. These inequalities and disparities are often linked to social, economic, and political factors, such as race, class, and power dynamics.

One of the most significant environmental disparities is the exposure to pollution. Communities of color, particularly low-income and indigenous communities, are disproportionately exposed to pollution from sources such as industrial sites, waste facilities, and transportation. This exposure can lead to a range of health issues, including respiratory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer.

In addition to exposure to pollution, environmental disparities also include unequal access to environmental benefits. For instance, low-income and minority communities often have limited access to parks, clean water, and other environmental amenities. This can have a significant impact on the quality of life for these communities.

The concept of environmental disparities is closely linked to the concept of environmental racism. Environmental racism refers to the disproportionate burden of environmental risks placed on communities of color. This can be seen in the location of hazardous waste sites, industrial facilities, and other sources of pollution near these communities. This not only exposes these communities to environmental risks but also limits their opportunities for economic development and social mobility.

To address environmental inequalities and disparities, local policy-driven strategies can be employed. These strategies can include zoning regulations, land use planning, and public participation processes. Zoning regulations can be used to restrict the location of certain types of facilities, such as waste facilities or industrial sites, near vulnerable communities. Land use planning can also be used to promote the development of parks and other environmental amenities in these communities. Public participation processes can ensure that these communities have a voice in decision-making processes that affect their environment.

In conclusion, environmental inequalities and disparities are a significant aspect of environmental justice. They refer to the unequal distribution of environmental benefits and burdens among different communities. Local policy-driven strategies can be employed to address these inequalities and disparities and promote environmental justice and equity in urban planning. 


#### 7.1c Case Studies of Environmental Justice and Equity Planning

In this section, we will explore some case studies that highlight the importance of environmental justice and equity planning in urban development. These case studies will provide real-world examples of how local policy-driven strategies can be used to address environmental inequalities and disparities.

##### Case Study 1: Flint Water Crisis

The Flint water crisis is a prime example of the devastating consequences of environmental injustice. In 2014, the city of Flint, Michigan switched its water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River without properly treating the water. This led to high levels of lead and other contaminants in the water, exposing the city's predominantly low-income and African American population to serious health risks.

The Flint water crisis highlights the importance of environmental equity planning. Had the city conducted a thorough environmental impact assessment and involved the community in decision-making processes, the crisis could have been prevented. This case also underscores the need for policies that prioritize the health and well-being of all communities, especially those that are marginalized and vulnerable.

Hurricane Katrina, which hit New Orleans in 2005, exposed the city's deep-rooted environmental inequalities. The storm disproportionately affected low-income and African American communities, who were more likely to live in flood-prone areas and lacked the resources to evacuate or rebuild.

The response to Hurricane Katrina highlighted the importance of environmental justice planning. The city's recovery efforts were criticized for neglecting the needs of marginalized communities and for not addressing the underlying environmental inequalities that contributed to the storm's impact. This case underscores the need for policies that promote equitable and sustainable development, especially in vulnerable communities.

##### Case Study 3: Environmental Injustice in the Navajo Nation

The Navajo Nation, one of the largest Native American reservations in the United States, has been disproportionately affected by environmental hazards. The region is home to numerous uranium mines and waste sites, which have contaminated the land and water, leading to high rates of cancer and other health issues among the Navajo population.

The Navajo Nation's environmental injustice highlights the need for equitable and inclusive environmental planning. The community has been fighting for decades to clean up the contamination and hold responsible parties accountable. This case underscores the importance of policies that prioritize the health and well-being of all communities, especially those that have been historically marginalized and disadvantaged.

In conclusion, these case studies demonstrate the critical role of environmental justice and equity planning in urban development. They highlight the need for policies that prioritize the health and well-being of all communities, especially those that are marginalized and vulnerable. By incorporating environmental justice and equity planning into local policies, we can create more just and sustainable cities for all.

Furthermore, cultural heritage can also contribute to social cohesion and understanding. By learning about and celebrating different cultural heritages, individuals can gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for diverse cultures, leading to increased social cohesion and understanding.

#### Challenges and Solutions

Despite its numerous benefits, preserving cultural heritage can also be a complex and contentious process. As mentioned in the related context, there can be competing interests and challenges in the preservation of cultural heritage. For example, the preservation of historic buildings may conflict with the need for modern development.

To address these challenges, local policies can play a crucial role. These policies can range from regulatory measures, such as preservation laws and guidelines, to incentivizing strategies, such as tax breaks for preserving historic buildings. By working closely with the community, these policies can be tailored to address the specific needs and concerns of the community, ensuring the preservation of cultural heritage while also promoting economic development.

### Subsection: 8.1c Balancing Development and Preservation

Balancing development and preservation is a critical aspect of cultural heritage and preservation. As communities grow and evolve, they often face the challenge of balancing the need for development with the preservation of their cultural heritage. This balance is essential for maintaining the community's identity and sense of place, while also meeting the needs of its current and future residents.

#### The Importance of Balancing Development and Preservation

Balancing development and preservation is crucial for several reasons. First, it helps to maintain the community's cultural identity and sense of place. Cultural heritage is often deeply intertwined with the physical environment, and the loss of historic buildings, landscapes, or other cultural resources can result in the loss of the community's unique identity.

Second, it can contribute to economic development. Preservation efforts can stimulate tourism, attract investment, and create jobs. For example, the preservation of historic buildings can attract tourists, leading to increased revenue from tourism. Similarly, the preservation of cultural property can increase property values, attracting investment and creating jobs in the construction and real estate sectors.

Finally, it can help to address issues of equity and inclusion. Preservation efforts can help to ensure that all members of the community have access to and benefit from the community's cultural heritage. This can be particularly important for marginalized or disadvantaged groups, who may have a strong connection to certain aspects of the community's cultural heritage.

#### Strategies for Balancing Development and Preservation

Balancing development and preservation requires a careful and strategic approach. Here are some strategies that can be used:

- **Preservation by Design**: This strategy involves incorporating preservation considerations into the design and planning process. For example, when developing a new building or project, preservationists can work with architects and planners to ensure that the new development is compatible with and respectful of the surrounding cultural heritage.

- **Preservation Easements**: Preservation easements are legal agreements that restrict the use of a property in order to protect its cultural heritage. These easements can be used to protect historic buildings, landscapes, or other cultural resources from incompatible development.

- **Adaptive Reuse**: Adaptive reuse involves repurposing existing buildings for new uses. This strategy can help to preserve historic buildings while also meeting the needs of the community. For example, an old factory might be converted into a housing development or a community center.

- **Preservation Funding**: Preservation efforts often require funding, and this can be a challenge, especially in communities with limited resources. However, there are various sources of funding available, including government grants, private donations, and tax incentives.

In conclusion, balancing development and preservation is a complex but crucial task. It requires a careful and strategic approach, and it is essential for maintaining the community's cultural heritage, promoting economic development, and addressing issues of equity and inclusion.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, cultural heritage and preservation are integral components of local policy-driven strategies for economic development and the just city. The preservation of cultural heritage not only helps to maintain a community's identity and sense of place, but it also contributes to economic development by attracting tourists and stimulating local economies. Furthermore, cultural preservation can play a crucial role in promoting social cohesion and inclusivity, as it allows for the celebration and recognition of diverse cultural identities within a community. 

Local policies that prioritize cultural heritage and preservation can take various forms, including zoning regulations, tax incentives, and public funding. These policies can help to ensure that cultural heritage is protected and preserved, while also promoting economic development and social cohesion. 

However, it is important to note that cultural preservation is not without its challenges. These can include issues of ownership and control, as well as the potential for gentrification and displacement. Therefore, it is crucial for local policies to be developed in consultation with all stakeholders, and to be regularly reviewed and updated to address any emerging issues. 

In the end, cultural heritage and preservation are key to creating a just city that is both economically vibrant and socially inclusive. By prioritizing cultural preservation in local policies, we can help to ensure that our cities are places where all residents can thrive and where cultural diversity is valued and celebrated.

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the complex relationship between commercial development and commercial values in the neighborhood. Commercial development plays a crucial role in shaping the economic landscape of a neighborhood, and it is influenced by a variety of factors, including local policies and community values. Understanding this relationship is essential for creating equitable and inclusive neighborhoods that meet the needs and aspirations of all residents.

We will begin by examining the role of local policies in shaping commercial development. Local policies, such as zoning regulations and tax incentives, can influence the types of businesses that are allowed to operate in a neighborhood and the amount of space they are allocated. These policies can also impact the affordability of commercial space, which in turn affects the types of businesses that can afford to operate in the neighborhood.

Next, we will delve into the concept of commercial values and how they shape commercial development. Commercial values refer to the beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that guide how businesses operate and interact with the community. These values can range from profit-driven to community-oriented, and they can have a significant impact on the types of businesses that are attracted to a neighborhood.

Finally, we will explore the relationship between commercial development and community values. Commercial development can both reflect and shape community values. On one hand, commercial development can reflect the values of the community, as businesses are often tailored to meet the needs and preferences of the residents. On the other hand, commercial development can also shape community values, as businesses can influence the way residents perceive and interact with their neighborhood.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the complex dynamics between commercial development and commercial values in the neighborhood. This knowledge will be crucial for policymakers, community leaders, and businesses in creating equitable and inclusive neighborhoods that meet the needs and aspirations of all residents.




### Subsection: 10.1a Neighborhood Commercial Development

Commercial development in a neighborhood is a complex process that is influenced by a variety of factors. These factors include local policies, community values, and the physical characteristics of the neighborhood. In this section, we will explore the role of local policies in shaping commercial development in the neighborhood.

#### Local Policies and Commercial Development

Local policies play a crucial role in shaping commercial development in a neighborhood. These policies can influence the types of businesses that are allowed to operate in a neighborhood, the amount of space they are allocated, and the affordability of commercial space. For example, zoning regulations can restrict the types of businesses that are allowed to operate in certain areas, while tax incentives can make commercial space more affordable for businesses.

One of the key local policies that can impact commercial development is the inclusionary zoning policy. This policy requires a certain percentage of affordable housing units in new developments, which can help to address the issue of gentrification and displacement in neighborhoods. By promoting affordable housing, inclusionary zoning can also attract a diverse range of businesses to a neighborhood, as it allows for a more diverse and inclusive customer base.

Another important policy is the commercial rent subsidy. This policy provides financial assistance to businesses, particularly small businesses, to help offset the costs of commercial rent. By making commercial space more affordable, this policy can encourage more businesses to locate in a neighborhood, which can in turn stimulate economic growth and revitalization.

#### Commercial Values and Commercial Development

Commercial values also play a significant role in shaping commercial development in a neighborhood. These values refer to the beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that guide how businesses operate and interact with the community. They can range from profit-driven to community-oriented, and they can have a significant impact on the types of businesses that are attracted to a neighborhood.

For example, businesses with a strong commitment to social responsibility and sustainability may be more likely to locate in a neighborhood with similar values. This can help to create a sense of community and belonging, as well as contribute to the overall well-being of the neighborhood.

#### The Relationship between Commercial Development and Community Values

The relationship between commercial development and community values is complex and multifaceted. Commercial development can both reflect and shape community values. On one hand, commercial development can reflect the values of the community, as businesses are often tailored to meet the needs and preferences of the residents. On the other hand, commercial development can also shape community values, as businesses can influence the way residents perceive and interact with their neighborhood.

For example, the development of a new shopping center or retail district can bring new businesses and job opportunities to a neighborhood, which can improve the overall economic well-being of the community. However, it can also lead to changes in the character and identity of the neighborhood, which may not align with the values of some residents.

In conclusion, commercial development in a neighborhood is influenced by a variety of factors, including local policies and community values. By understanding and addressing these factors, we can create more equitable and inclusive neighborhoods that meet the needs and aspirations of all residents.





### Subsection: 10.1b Factors Influencing Commercial Values

Commercial values are shaped by a variety of factors, including local policies, community values, and the physical characteristics of the neighborhood. These factors can influence the types of businesses that are allowed to operate in a neighborhood, the amount of space they are allocated, and the affordability of commercial space.

#### Local Policies and Commercial Values

Local policies play a crucial role in shaping commercial values in a neighborhood. These policies can influence the types of businesses that are allowed to operate in certain areas, the amount of space they are allocated, and the affordability of commercial space. For example, zoning regulations can restrict the types of businesses that are allowed to operate in certain areas, while tax incentives can make commercial space more affordable for businesses.

One of the key local policies that can impact commercial values is the inclusionary zoning policy. This policy requires a certain percentage of affordable housing units in new developments, which can help to address the issue of gentrification and displacement in neighborhoods. By promoting affordable housing, inclusionary zoning can also attract a diverse range of businesses to a neighborhood, as it allows for a more diverse and inclusive customer base.

Another important policy is the commercial rent subsidy. This policy provides financial assistance to businesses, particularly small businesses, to help offset the costs of commercial rent. By making commercial space more affordable, this policy can encourage more businesses to locate in a neighborhood, which can in turn stimulate economic growth and revitalization.

#### Community Values and Commercial Values

Community values also play a significant role in shaping commercial values in a neighborhood. These values refer to the beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that guide how businesses operate and interact with the community. For example, a community that values sustainability and environmental responsibility may attract businesses that align with these values, such as organic food stores or renewable energy companies.

Community values can also influence the types of businesses that are allowed to operate in a neighborhood. For instance, a community that values family-friendly environments may restrict the types of businesses that serve alcohol or have late-night hours. This can impact the types of businesses that are able to thrive in the neighborhood.

#### Physical Characteristics of the Neighborhood

The physical characteristics of a neighborhood can also influence commercial values. For example, the location of a neighborhood can impact the types of businesses that are able to operate there. A neighborhood located in a busy downtown area may attract more office buildings and retail stores, while a neighborhood located in a more residential area may attract more service-based businesses.

The physical characteristics of a neighborhood can also impact the affordability of commercial space. For instance, a neighborhood with a high cost of living may have more expensive commercial rent, making it more difficult for small businesses to operate. This can lead to a concentration of larger, more established businesses in the neighborhood.

In conclusion, commercial values in a neighborhood are shaped by a variety of factors, including local policies, community values, and the physical characteristics of the neighborhood. These factors can influence the types of businesses that are allowed to operate in a neighborhood, the amount of space they are allocated, and the affordability of commercial space. Understanding these factors is crucial for promoting a diverse and inclusive commercial landscape in a neighborhood.





### Subsection: 10.1c Strategies for Promoting Commercial Development

Promoting commercial development in a neighborhood requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses both local policies and community values. Here are some strategies that can be used to promote commercial development in a neighborhood:

#### Leveraging Local Policies

Local policies can be leveraged to promote commercial development. For instance, inclusionary zoning policies can be expanded to include commercial spaces, requiring a certain percentage of affordable commercial spaces in new developments. This can help to attract a diverse range of businesses to a neighborhood, providing more opportunities for local residents and stimulating economic growth.

Commercial rent subsidies can also be increased or expanded to more businesses, making commercial space more affordable and encouraging more businesses to locate in a neighborhood. Additionally, local governments can provide other incentives, such as tax breaks or grants, to attract businesses to a neighborhood.

#### Promoting Community Values

Promoting community values can also be an effective strategy for promoting commercial development. This can be achieved by encouraging businesses to adopt practices that align with the community's values. For example, if a community values sustainability, local governments can incentivize businesses to adopt sustainable practices, such as using renewable energy sources or implementing waste reduction programs.

Community engagement can also be used to promote community values. Local governments can organize events or workshops to educate businesses about the community's values and how they can align with them. This can help to create a sense of shared responsibility and commitment to the community among businesses, leading to more positive relationships and a stronger sense of community.

#### Collaborating with Existing Businesses

Collaborating with existing businesses can also be an effective strategy for promoting commercial development. This can involve working with existing businesses to identify opportunities for growth and expansion, or providing support and resources to help them thrive. By collaborating with existing businesses, local governments can help to create a more vibrant and diverse commercial landscape in a neighborhood.

In conclusion, promoting commercial development in a neighborhood requires a comprehensive approach that addresses local policies, community values, and existing businesses. By leveraging local policies, promoting community values, and collaborating with existing businesses, local governments can create a more thriving and inclusive commercial landscape in their neighborhoods.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the complex relationship between commercial development and commercial values in the neighborhood. We have seen how commercial development can have both positive and negative impacts on a neighborhood, and how these impacts can be influenced by the values and policies of the local community. We have also discussed various strategies for promoting commercial development that align with the values of the community, and for mitigating potential negative impacts.

Commercial development is a crucial aspect of economic development and the just city. It provides opportunities for job creation, economic growth, and improved quality of life. However, it also presents challenges, such as gentrification, displacement, and changes in the character of the neighborhood. Therefore, it is essential for local governments and communities to carefully consider and manage commercial development to ensure that it benefits all members of the community.

In conclusion, commercial development and commercial values are intertwined and require careful consideration and management. By understanding the complexities of this relationship and implementing effective strategies, we can create more equitable and inclusive neighborhoods that support economic development and the just city.

## Chapter: Chapter 11: Public Space Design and Public Space Values

### Introduction

Public spaces are the heart of any community, serving as the physical manifestation of the social, cultural, and economic life of its inhabitants. They are the places where people gather, interact, and engage in various activities, from leisurely strolls to vibrant street markets. However, the design of these public spaces can significantly influence their value and impact on the community. This chapter, "Public Space Design and Public Space Values," delves into the intricate relationship between the design of public spaces and the values they embody.

The design of public spaces is a multifaceted process that involves a careful consideration of various factors, including the physical characteristics of the space, the needs and preferences of the community, and the broader socio-economic context. It is a process that requires a deep understanding of the values that the community ascribes to these spaces. These values can be diverse and complex, encompassing everything from aesthetic appeal and functionality to inclusivity and sustainability.

In this chapter, we will explore the various aspects of public space design, from the initial planning stages to the final implementation. We will also delve into the concept of public space values, examining how these values are shaped by the design of the space and how they, in turn, influence the design process. We will also discuss the role of local policy in shaping public space design and values, and how these policies can be used to promote equity and inclusion in the design of public spaces.

By the end of this chapter, readers should have a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between public space design and public space values. They should also be equipped with the knowledge and tools to effectively navigate the challenges and opportunities that arise in the design of public spaces, and to create spaces that are not only aesthetically pleasing and functional, but also inclusive and equitable.




#### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the complex relationship between commercial development and commercial values in the neighborhood. We have seen how the rise of commercialization has transformed the landscape of many neighborhoods, bringing both opportunities and challenges. We have also discussed the importance of local policies and strategies in guiding commercial development towards a more equitable and inclusive direction.

Commercial development is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it can bring jobs, economic growth, and improved services to a neighborhood. On the other hand, it can also lead to gentrification, displacement, and the loss of local character. The key is to strike a balance and ensure that commercial development is inclusive and benefits all members of the community.

Local policies and strategies play a crucial role in shaping commercial development. They can set guidelines for the types of businesses allowed, the size and scale of development, and the provision of affordable housing. They can also incentivize developers to include affordable housing, public spaces, and other community benefits in their projects.

However, implementing these policies and strategies can be challenging. It requires collaboration and compromise among various stakeholders, including developers, community members, and government agencies. It also requires ongoing monitoring and adjustment to address emerging issues and changing circumstances.

### Section: 11.1a Social Enterprises and Economic Development

Social enterprises have gained significant attention in recent years as a potential solution to address economic development and create a more just city. In this section, we will explore the role of social enterprises in economic development and how they can contribute to creating a more equitable and inclusive society.

#### What is a Social Enterprise?

A social enterprise is a business model that prioritizes social and environmental impact over profit. It is a dynamic and adaptive approach that operates to achieve a balanced financial, social, and environmental set of objectives. Social enterprises are driven by a shared common thread of creating positive change in the world, and they achieve this by operating as a business.

Social enterprises can take various forms, including trading enterprises, worker- and employee-owned trading enterprises, and community enterprises. These enterprises operate with the goal of creating a positive impact on society and the environment, while also generating revenue. This revenue is then reinvested into the mission of the enterprise, creating a sustainable and long-term solution for economic development.

#### The Role of Social Enterprises in Economic Development

Social enterprises play a crucial role in economic development by addressing the needs of communities and individuals in an ever-changing world. They operate with the goal of creating a balanced financial, social, and environmental set of objectives, making them a valuable tool for creating a more just and inclusive city.

One of the key ways in which social enterprises contribute to economic development is by creating job opportunities. By providing employment opportunities, social enterprises not only address the issue of unemployment but also provide individuals with valuable skills and experience. This not only benefits the individuals but also contributes to the overall economic growth of the city.

Moreover, social enterprises also play a crucial role in stimulating local economies. By operating as businesses, they generate revenue and create a ripple effect in the local economy. This revenue is then reinvested into the mission of the enterprise, creating a sustainable and long-term solution for economic development.

#### Addressing Social and Environmental Issues

Social enterprises also play a significant role in addressing social and environmental issues. By prioritizing social and environmental impact, they are able to address the needs of marginalized communities and promote sustainable practices. This not only creates a positive impact on society and the environment but also contributes to creating a more just and inclusive city.

#### Collaboration and Local Policies

Collaboration between social enterprises and traditional businesses is crucial for the success of social enterprises. By working together, they can leverage their strengths and create a more significant impact. Local policies and strategies also play a crucial role in promoting and supporting social enterprises. By creating a conducive environment for social enterprises to thrive, local policies can contribute to the overall success of social enterprises in economic development.

In conclusion, social enterprises have the potential to play a significant role in economic development and creating a more just and inclusive city. By prioritizing social and environmental impact, creating job opportunities, and stimulating local economies, social enterprises are a valuable tool for addressing the needs of communities and individuals in an ever-changing world. Collaboration and local policies are crucial for the success of social enterprises, and by working together, we can create a more equitable and sustainable future for all.


## Chapter 11: Toward Control: Social Enterprise as Development:




#### 11.1b Models of Social Enterprise

There are various models of social enterprise that can be used to achieve economic development and create a more just and inclusive city. These models can be broadly categorized into three types: trading enterprises, worker- and employee-owned trading enterprises, and community enterprises.

##### Trading Enterprises

Trading enterprises are the most common type of social enterprise. They operate like any other business, but with a focus on creating a positive social and environmental impact. These enterprises generate revenue by selling goods or services to customers, and the profits are reinvested into the mission of the enterprise. Trading enterprises can range from small-scale operations to large corporations, and they can operate in any industry.

They provide a platform for diverse perspectives to be heard and for solutions to be proposed and discussed. In this section, we will explore the importance and purpose of public roundtables in the context of equity and inclusion.

#### 12.1a Importance and Purpose of Public Roundtables

Public roundtables serve multiple purposes in promoting equity and inclusion. Firstly, they provide a space for diverse perspectives to be heard. In many cities, there are often disparities and inequalities that exist between different communities. Public roundtables allow for these communities to come together and have a dialogue about the issues that affect them. This not only promotes understanding and empathy, but also allows for the identification of potential solutions.

Secondly, public roundtables can be used to address economic disparities and social inequalities. By bringing together stakeholders from different backgrounds, roundtables can facilitate discussions about the root causes of these disparities and inequalities. This can lead to the development of policies and programs that aim to address these issues and promote equity.

Thirdly, public roundtables can also serve as a platform for community engagement. By involving community members in the decision-making process, roundtables can increase their sense of ownership and empowerment. This can lead to a more inclusive and participatory approach to economic development and the just city.

However, public roundtables also have their limitations. One of the main challenges is ensuring equal representation and participation. In many cases, marginalized communities may not have the resources or access to participate in these discussions. This can lead to unequal representation and hinder the effectiveness of roundtables.

To address these challenges, it is important to have careful facilitation and planning for public roundtables. This includes ensuring diverse representation, creating a safe and inclusive space for discussion, and providing resources and support for community members to participate. Additionally, it is important to follow up on the discussions and recommendations from roundtables to ensure action is taken.

In conclusion, public roundtables are a crucial tool for promoting equity and inclusion in economic development and the just city. They provide a platform for diverse perspectives to be heard, address economic disparities and social inequalities, and promote community engagement. However, careful planning and facilitation are necessary to ensure their effectiveness.

### Section: 14.1 Urban Planning and Public Health:

Urban planning plays a crucial role in promoting public health and creating a just city. It involves the design and management of the physical environment, including land use, transportation, and infrastructure, to improve the quality of life for all residents. In this section, we will explore the intersection of urban planning and public health, and how local policies can be used to promote equity and inclusion in economic development.

#### 14.1a The Intersection of Urban Planning and Public Health

Urban planning and public health are closely intertwined. The physical environment of a city can have a significant impact on the health and well-being of its residents. For example, access to green spaces and parks has been linked to improved mental and physical health, while exposure to air pollution and extreme heat events can have negative effects on health.

One of the key considerations in urban planning is the impact on public health. Urban climatology, the study of climate and its effects on urban areas, plays a crucial role in decision-making for municipal planning and policy. It helps planners understand the potential impacts of pollution, extreme heat events, and stormwater modeling on public health.

Another important aspect of urban planning and public health is the use of geographic information systems (GIS). GIS is a powerful tool that allows planners to analyze and visualize data, such as health outcomes and environmental factors, to inform decision-making. By using GIS, planners can identify areas with high levels of pollution or lack of access to green spaces and develop targeted interventions to improve public health.

#### 14.1b The Role of Local Policies in Promoting Equity and Inclusion in Economic Development

Local policies play a crucial role in promoting equity and inclusion in economic development. They provide a framework for decision-making and guide the actions of urban planners and policymakers. By incorporating equity and inclusion principles into local policies, cities can create a more just and equitable environment for all residents.

One example of a local policy that promotes equity and inclusion is the inclusionary zoning policy. This policy requires developers to include a certain percentage of affordable housing units in new developments, ensuring that low-income residents have access to affordable housing. This can help address the issue of housing affordability and reduce health disparities related to housing.

Another important policy is the complete streets policy, which aims to create safe and accessible streets for all modes of transportation, including walking, biking, and public transit. This can improve public health by promoting physical activity and reducing air pollution from vehicle emissions. Additionally, complete streets can also address issues of equity and inclusion by providing equal access to transportation for all residents, regardless of their income or mode of transportation.

#### 14.1c Case Studies of Urban Planning and Public Health

To further illustrate the impact of urban planning on public health, let's examine some case studies. In the city of Portland, Oregon, the implementation of a complete streets policy has led to improved public health outcomes. By prioritizing pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, the city has seen a decrease in vehicle miles traveled and a corresponding decrease in air pollution. This has also led to increased physical activity among residents, resulting in improved mental and physical health.

In another example, the city of Boston, Massachusetts, has implemented an inclusionary zoning policy to address the issue of housing affordability. This policy has resulted in the creation of over 1,000 affordable housing units, providing low-income residents with access to safe and affordable housing. This has also helped reduce health disparities related to housing, as low-income residents are now able to access better quality housing.

#### 14.1d Conclusion

In conclusion, urban planning and public health are closely intertwined, and local policies play a crucial role in promoting equity and inclusion in economic development. By incorporating equity and inclusion principles into local policies, cities can create a more just and equitable environment for all residents, leading to improved public health outcomes. Case studies from cities like Portland and Boston demonstrate the positive impact of urban planning on public health and the importance of local policies in promoting equity and inclusion.

By using GIS, planners can identify areas with high levels of pollution or lack of access to green spaces and develop targeted interventions to improve public health.

#### 14.1b Health Impact Assessments in Urban Planning

Health impact assessments (HIAs) are a crucial tool in urban planning that helps evaluate the potential health impacts of proposed developments or policies. HIAs are used to identify potential health risks and benefits, and to develop strategies to mitigate any negative impacts. They are often required by local governments as part of the planning process to ensure that public health is considered in all development decisions.

HIAs are typically conducted by a team of experts, including urban planners, public health professionals, and other stakeholders. They involve a thorough analysis of the proposed development or policy, including its potential impacts on air quality, noise levels, access to green spaces, and other factors that may affect public health. The results of the HIA are then used to inform decision-making and develop strategies to address any potential health impacts.

#### 14.1c Case Studies of Urban Planning and Public Health

To further illustrate the importance of urban planning in promoting public health, let's examine two case studies: the development of a new park in a low-income neighborhood and the redesign of a busy street to improve pedestrian safety.

In the first case study, a new park is being developed in a low-income neighborhood with limited access to green spaces. The HIA for this project identified potential benefits such as increased physical activity and improved air quality, as well as potential risks such as increased noise levels and potential for crime in the park. To address these concerns, the HIA team developed a plan for a multi-use park with a variety of activities to encourage physical activity, as well as measures to mitigate noise and crime.

In the second case study, a busy street is being redesigned to improve pedestrian safety. The HIA for this project identified potential benefits such as reduced traffic injuries and improved air quality, as well as potential risks such as increased traffic congestion and potential for noise pollution. To address these concerns, the HIA team developed a plan for a complete street design, which includes dedicated bike lanes, wider sidewalks, and traffic calming measures.

These case studies demonstrate the importance of considering public health in urban planning decisions. By conducting HIAs and involving a diverse group of stakeholders, urban planners can ensure that developments and policies are designed to promote the health and well-being of all residents.

It is a complex and multifaceted issue that intersects with various other policy areas such as land use, transportation, and social services. In this chapter, we will explore the relationship between housing policy and equity, and how local policies can be used to promote economic development and create a just city.

The concept of equity in housing refers to the fair distribution of housing opportunities and resources among different groups of people. It is a fundamental principle that guides housing policy and is essential for creating a just city. However, achieving equity in housing is a challenging task, as it requires addressing a range of complex and interconnected issues.

One of the key factors that contribute to housing equity is the availability of affordable housing. Affordable housing refers to housing that is within the financial means of low and moderate-income households. It is a critical component of a just city, as it ensures that all members of the community have access to safe and decent housing.

In this chapter, we will delve into the various aspects of housing policy and equity, including the role of local governments, the impact of housing policies on different groups, and the challenges and opportunities in promoting housing equity. We will also explore the relationship between housing policy and other policy areas, such as economic development and social services.

Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of housing policy and equity, and how it can be used as a tool for promoting economic development and creating a just city. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the complexities of housing policy and equity, and the role it plays in shaping our cities.




### Subsection: 15.1a Understanding Housing Policy

Housing policy is a crucial aspect of urban planning and development. It is a set of rules, regulations, and guidelines that govern the provision of housing in a city. These policies are designed to address issues of affordability, accessibility, and quality of housing. They also aim to promote equity and inclusivity in the housing market.

#### The Role of Housing Policy in Economic Development

Housing policy plays a significant role in economic development. It affects the availability and affordability of housing, which in turn impacts the cost of living and the standard of living for residents. Housing policy also influences the overall economic health of a city by affecting the demand for housing and the construction industry.

For instance, policies that promote affordable housing can help to reduce the cost of living for residents, making it more affordable for them to live in the city. This can attract more people to the city, increasing the demand for housing and stimulating the construction industry. On the other hand, policies that restrict the supply of housing can lead to housing shortages and rising housing prices, making it more difficult for people to afford housing and potentially hindering economic development.

#### The Impact of Housing Policy on Equity and Inclusion

Housing policy also has a significant impact on equity and inclusion. Equity in housing refers to the fair distribution of housing opportunities and resources among different groups of people. Inclusion in housing refers to the ability of all members of the community to participate in the housing market and have access to safe and decent housing.

Housing policies can promote equity and inclusion by addressing issues of affordability and accessibility. For example, policies that provide subsidies or tax incentives for affordable housing can help to make housing more accessible to low-income households. Similarly, policies that require developers to include a certain percentage of affordable units in new developments can help to address issues of affordability and promote equity.

#### The Challenges and Opportunities in Housing Policy

Despite its importance, implementing effective housing policies can be challenging. One of the main challenges is balancing the competing interests of different stakeholders, such as developers, residents, and the government. This requires careful consideration of the potential impacts of policies on different groups and finding ways to address their concerns.

However, there are also opportunities in housing policy. For instance, the use of technology and data can help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of housing policies. Data-driven approaches can help to identify areas of high housing demand and inform decisions about where to focus resources. Technology can also be used to streamline processes and reduce costs, making housing policies more sustainable and affordable.

In conclusion, housing policy plays a crucial role in economic development and promoting equity and inclusion in the housing market. It is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration and collaboration among different stakeholders. By understanding the principles and strategies of housing policy, local governments can create more equitable and inclusive housing markets and contribute to the overall well-being of their communities.





### Subsection: 15.1b Housing Affordability and Equity

Housing affordability is a critical aspect of housing policy and equity. It refers to the ability of households to access and maintain decent, safe, and affordable housing without experiencing housing stress. Housing stress occurs when a household is forced to spend more than 30% of its income on housing costs, including rent or mortgage payments, utilities, and maintenance. This can lead to financial hardship and difficulty meeting other basic needs, such as food, healthcare, and education.

#### The Relationship between Housing Affordability and Equity

Housing affordability is closely linked to equity. Equity in housing refers to the fair distribution of housing opportunities and resources among different groups of people. Housing affordability is a key factor in achieving housing equity. If certain groups of people, such as low-income households or minority groups, face barriers to accessing affordable housing, this can exacerbate existing inequalities and limit their opportunities for social and economic participation.

#### Housing Affordability and Equity in the United States

In the United States, housing affordability and equity have been major challenges. The National Association of Realtors (NAR) publishes a monthly Housing Affordability Index, which measures whether or not a typical family earns enough income to qualify for a mortgage loan on a typical home at the national and regional levels. The index is calculated based on the most recent price and income data.

According to the NAR, a value of 100 on the Housing Affordability Index means that a family with the median income has exactly enough income to qualify for a mortgage on a median-priced home. An index above 100 signifies that family earning the median income has more than enough income to qualify for a mortgage loan on a median-priced home, assuming a 20% down payment and a qualifying ratio of 25%.

However, despite these efforts, housing affordability remains a significant issue in the United States. The Center for Neighborhood Technology's Housing + Transportation Affordability Index, which provides a "comprehensive view of affordability that includes both the cost of housing and the cost of transportation at the neighborhood level," has found that many neighborhoods in the United States are unaffordable for low-income households. This highlights the need for more comprehensive and inclusive housing policies that address both housing affordability and equity.

An index above 100 signifies that family earning the median income has more than enough income to qualify for a mortgage loan on a median-priced home, assuming a 20% down payment and a qualifying ratio of 25%.

However, despite these efforts, housing affordability remains a significant issue in the United States. The Center for Neighborhood Technology's Housing + Transportation Affordability Index, which provides a "comprehensive view of affordability that includes both the cost of housing and the cost of transportation at the neighborhood level," has found that many neighborhoods in the United States are unaffordable for low-income household households. This highlights the need for more comprehensive and inclusive housing policies that address both housing affordability and equity.

#### Housing Affordability and Equity in the United States

In the United States, housing affordability and equity have been major challenges. The National Association of Realtors (NAR) publishes a monthly Housing Affordability Index, which measures whether or not a typical family earns enough income to qualify for a mortgage loan on a typical home at the national and regional levels. The index is calculated based on the most recent price and income data.

According to the NAR, a value of 100 on the Housing Affordability Index means that a family with the median income has exactly enough income to qualify for a mortgage on a median-priced home. An index above 100 signifies that family earning the median income has more than enough income to qualify for a mortgage loan on a median-priced home, assuming a 20% down payment and a qualifying ratio of 25%.

### Subsection: 15.1c Strategies for Equitable Housing Policy

In order to address the challenges of housing affordability and equity, local governments can implement a variety of strategies. These strategies can be broadly categorized into three areas: increasing housing supply, providing affordable housing options, and promoting fair housing practices.

#### Increasing Housing Supply

One of the most effective ways to increase housing affordability is by increasing the supply of housing. This can be achieved through various means, such as relaxing zoning laws, allowing for denser development, and providing incentives for developers to build affordable housing units. By increasing the supply of housing, the demand for housing can be spread out, leading to a decrease in housing prices.

#### Providing Affordable Housing Options

In addition to increasing housing supply, local governments can also provide affordable housing options directly. This can be done through public housing programs, housing vouchers, or tax credits for affordable housing development. These programs can help low-income households access decent, safe, and affordable housing.

#### Promoting Fair Housing Practices

Local governments can also play a role in promoting fair housing practices. This can be achieved through anti-discrimination laws, affordable housing policies, and community land trusts. Anti-discrimination laws can help prevent discrimination in the housing market, while affordable housing policies can ensure that affordable housing options are available in all neighborhoods. Community land trusts, on the other hand, can help preserve affordable housing options by removing housing units from the speculative market.

#### Case Studies of Equitable Housing Policy

To further illustrate these strategies, let's look at some case studies of local governments that have successfully implemented equitable housing policies.

##### Case Study 1: Portland, Oregon

In Portland, Oregon, the city government has implemented a variety of strategies to address housing affordability and equity. This includes relaxing zoning laws to allow for denser development, providing incentives for developers to build affordable housing units, and implementing a community land trust to preserve affordable housing options. As a result, Portland has seen a significant increase in housing supply and a decrease in housing prices, making housing more affordable for low-income households.

##### Case Study 2: San Francisco, California

In San Francisco, the city government has implemented a housing voucher program to provide affordable housing options for low-income households. This program has helped thousands of households access decent, safe, and affordable housing. In addition, the city has also implemented anti-discrimination laws and affordable housing policies to promote fair housing practices.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, local governments play a crucial role in addressing housing affordability and equity. By implementing strategies such as increasing housing supply, providing affordable housing options, and promoting fair housing practices, local governments can help create more equitable housing policies and contribute to a more just city.

### Section: 16.1 Transportation Planning and Equity:

Transportation planning is a crucial aspect of urban development that has a significant impact on the equity and inclusion of different communities within a city. It involves the coordination of various stakeholders, including government agencies, private sector entities, and community groups, to create a comprehensive and sustainable transportation system that meets the needs of all members of the community.

#### 16.1a The Role of Transportation in Urban Equity

Transportation plays a critical role in promoting equity and inclusion in urban areas. It provides access to essential services such as education, healthcare, and employment opportunities, and is a key factor in determining the quality of life for individuals and communities. However, transportation planning has often been criticized for perpetuating and exacerbating existing social and economic inequalities.

One of the main ways in which transportation planning can impact equity is through its influence on housing affordability. As mentioned in the related context, there is a concern that anti-sprawl policies, such as urban intensification and smart growth, may lead to increased housing prices. This can have a disproportionate impact on low-income and minority communities, who may already face challenges in finding affordable housing options.

In addition to housing affordability, transportation planning also plays a role in promoting or hindering social equity. The distribution of transportation options and services can have a significant impact on the ability of different communities to access essential services and opportunities. For example, in urban centers like Los Angeles and San Francisco, minority areas often have limited transportation options, leading to overcrowded and unsafe transportation routes. This not only affects the daily lives of these communities but also limits their ability to move out of urban areas and access better opportunities.

Transportation planning also has a direct impact on economic equity. The distribution of transportation options and services can affect the ability of different communities to access employment opportunities. This can have a significant impact on the economic well-being of individuals and communities, particularly those from low-income and minority backgrounds.

#### 16.1b The Paradox of Intensification and its Impact on Equity

The concept of the paradox of intensification, as proposed by Melia et al. (2011), highlights the complex relationship between transportation planning and equity. While planning policies that increase population densities in urban areas can reduce car use, the effect is weak, and doubling the population density of a particular area will not halve the frequency or distance of car use. This means that while intensification can help reduce car use, it may not be enough to address the transportation disparities faced by low-income and minority communities.

#### 16.1c Case Studies of Transportation Planning and Equity

To further understand the impact of transportation planning on equity, let us examine some case studies. In Portland, Oregon, the implementation of anti-sprawl policies has led to a decrease in housing affordability, particularly for low-income and minority communities. This has raised concerns about the potential negative impact of these policies on social and economic equity.

On the other hand, in Curitiba, Brazil, the implementation of a comprehensive transportation plan has led to significant improvements in equity. The city has implemented a bus rapid transit system, known as the "Tube," which provides affordable and efficient transportation options for all members of the community. This has not only improved access to essential services and opportunities but has also led to a decrease in car use and traffic congestion, promoting a more sustainable and equitable transportation system.

#### 16.1d Conclusion

Transportation planning plays a crucial role in promoting equity and inclusion in urban areas. It has the potential to address transportation disparities faced by low-income and minority communities, but it can also perpetuate and exacerbate existing social and economic inequalities. Therefore, it is essential for transportation planners to consider the potential impact of their policies on equity and work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive transportation system for all members of the community.

This not only affects the daily lives of these communities but also limits their ability to move out of urban areas and access better opportunities.

#### 16.1b Equitable Transportation Planning Strategies

To address the issue of transportation equity, it is important to implement equitable transportation planning strategies. These strategies aim to promote fair and equal access to transportation services for all members of the community, regardless of their socio-economic status or ethnicity. One such strategy is the use of transportation demand management (TDM) policies.

TDM policies aim to reduce the number of single-occupancy vehicles (SOVs) on the road and promote the use of alternative modes of transportation, such as public transit, walking, and biking. This can help alleviate traffic congestion and reduce air pollution, while also promoting social equity by providing more transportation options for low-income and minority communities.

Another equitable transportation planning strategy is the use of transit-oriented development (TOD). TOD involves the development of compact, walkable, and transit-friendly communities that are designed to reduce the need for personal vehicles. This can help promote social equity by providing more affordable housing options and improving access to essential services for low-income and minority communities.

In addition to these strategies, it is important for transportation planners to consider the potential impacts of their policies on different communities. This can be achieved through community engagement and participation, where community members are involved in the decision-making process and have a say in the design and implementation of transportation projects.

Overall, equitable transportation planning is crucial for promoting social equity and inclusion in urban areas. By implementing strategies such as TDM and TOD, and involving community members in the decision-making process, we can create a more just and sustainable transportation system for all.

#### 16.1b The Role of Transportation in Economic Development

Transportation planning also plays a crucial role in economic development. It is essential for creating a well-connected and efficient transportation system that supports economic growth and job creation. A reliable and accessible transportation system can attract businesses and investors, leading to job opportunities and economic prosperity.

However, transportation planning can also have a significant impact on economic equity. The distribution of transportation options and services can affect the ability of different communities to access job opportunities and economic resources. For example, in cities with limited public transportation options, low-income and minority communities may face barriers to accessing job opportunities, leading to higher unemployment rates and economic disparities.

#### 16.1c Case Studies in Equitable Transportation Planning

To better understand the role of transportation planning in promoting equity and inclusion, let's examine some case studies from different cities around the world.

##### Case Study 1: Portland, Oregon

Portland, Oregon has been recognized as a leader in sustainable and equitable transportation planning.

### Subsection: 17.1c Strategies for Equitable Urban Design

Urban design plays a crucial role in promoting equity and inclusion in cities. By incorporating specific strategies, urban design can help create more equitable and inclusive urban environments.

#### Incorporating Equity and Inclusion in Urban Design

One strategy for promoting equity and inclusion in urban design is through the use of the Integrated Modification Methodology (IMM). This methodology is based on an iterative process involving four major phases: Investigation, Vertical Investigation, Key Categories, and Evaluation.

The first phase, Investigation, involves a synthesis-based inquiry into the systemic structure of the urban form. This phase begins with "Horizontal Investigation," where the area under study is broken down into its morphology-generator elements, including Urban Built-ups, Urban Voids, Types of Uses, and Links. This is followed by "Vertical Investigation," which studies the integral relationships between these elements. The output of Vertical Investigation is a set of quantitative descriptions and qualitative illustrations of certain attributes known as "Key Categories." These Key Categories are the result of an emergence process of interaction between the elementary parts, forming a synergy that adds value to the combined organization. They are fundamental in understanding the architecture of the city as a Complex Adaptive System.

The second phase, Key Categories, is a crucial step in promoting equity and inclusion. By understanding the Key Categories, urban designers can identify areas for improvement and develop strategies to address issues of equity and inclusion. This phase concludes with the "Evaluation" step, which examines the system's performance by referring to a list of verified indicators associated with ecological sustainability.

#### Other Strategies for Equitable Urban Design

In addition to the Integrated Modification Methodology, there are other strategies that can be used to promote equity and inclusion in urban design. These include:

- Universal Design: By incorporating principles of universal design, urban design can help create spaces that are accessible to all members of the community. This includes considerations of physical accessibility, such as ramps and elevators, as well as social accessibility, such as inclusive public spaces and programming.

- Affordable Housing and Mixed-Use Developments: By incorporating affordable housing options and mixed-use developments, urban design can help create more equitable communities. This can help address issues of gentrification and displacement, which can disproportionately affect low-income and minority communities.

- Inclusive Public Spaces and Programming: By creating inclusive public spaces and programming, urban design can help create spaces where all members of the community feel welcome and valued. This can help address issues of social exclusion and marginalization.

- Community Engagement: Engaging with the community is crucial in promoting equity and inclusion in urban design. By involving community members in the design process, their needs and perspectives can be taken into account, leading to more equitable and inclusive urban spaces.

Incorporating these strategies can help create more equitable and inclusive urban environments, promoting a sense of place and identity for different communities within a city. By understanding the Key Categories and utilizing other strategies, urban designers can work towards creating more equitable and inclusive cities for all members of the community.

In many urban centers, there is a stark contrast between the resources and opportunities available in different neighborhoods. This is often due to historical and systemic factors, such as discriminatory housing policies and practices, that have led to the unequal distribution of resources and opportunities. Land use planning can help address these issues by promoting equitable development and ensuring that all neighborhoods have access to necessary resources and opportunities.

#### Promoting Equity through Land Use Planning

Land use planning can be used to promote equity in urban areas in several ways. One way is through the use of zoning regulations, which can be used to promote affordable housing in areas with high housing costs. This can help address the issue of housing affordability and provide more housing options for low-income residents.

Another way is through density regulations, which can be used to promote mixed-income communities. By allowing for a mix of housing types and income levels in the same neighborhood, density regulations can help create more inclusive and diverse communities. This can also help address issues of segregation and exclusion, as low-income residents can afford to live in the same neighborhood as higher-income residents.

#### The Role of Community Engagement in Land Use Planning

Community engagement is a crucial aspect of land use planning that promotes equity and inclusion. By involving all members of the community in decision-making processes, their needs and concerns can be addressed, and they can have a say in the development of their neighborhood. This not only promotes a sense of ownership and pride in the community, but it also ensures that the development of the city is inclusive and meets the needs of all residents.

In addition, community engagement can help address issues of equity and inclusion by promoting diversity and representation in decision-making processes. By involving a diverse group of community members, different perspectives and needs can be considered, leading to more equitable and inclusive outcomes.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, land use planning plays a crucial role in promoting equity and inclusion in urban areas. By addressing issues of accessibility, affordability, and diversity, land use planning can help create more equitable and inclusive cities for all residents. Community engagement is also essential in promoting equity and inclusion, as it allows for the involvement of all members of the community in decision-making processes. By working together, land use planning and community engagement can help create more just and equitable cities for all.

#### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the intersection of climate change and urban equity, and how these two critical issues are intertwined. We have seen how climate change disproportionately affects marginalized communities, particularly those in urban areas, and how this exacerbates existing social and economic inequalities. We have also discussed the importance of incorporating equity and inclusion considerations in climate change policies and strategies, to ensure that all communities have equal access to resources and opportunities for adaptation and resilience.

Climate change is a global issue, but its impacts are felt most acutely at the local level. Therefore, it is crucial for local governments to play a leading role in addressing climate change and promoting urban equity. This requires a shift from traditional top-down approaches to a more inclusive and participatory approach, where all communities are involved in decision-making processes. It also requires a commitment to equity and inclusion in all aspects of climate change policies and strategies, from mitigation and adaptation to disaster risk reduction and resilience building.

As we move forward, it is essential to recognize that climate change and urban equity are not separate issues, but rather two sides of the same coin. Addressing one without the other will not lead to a just and sustainable future. Therefore, we must continue to explore and implement local policy-driven strategies that promote both climate change mitigation and adaptation, and urban equity and inclusion.
