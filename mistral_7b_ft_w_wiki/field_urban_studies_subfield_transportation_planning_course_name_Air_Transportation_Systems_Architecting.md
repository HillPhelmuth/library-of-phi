The formation consisted of three aircraft flying in a V-formation, with the lead aircraft setting the course and the other two following in close formation. This formation was used for reconnaissance missions, providing a comprehensive view of the surrounding airspace and enhancing situational awareness.

In the 1920s, the U.S. Army Air Corps continued to study formation flight, with a particular focus on the use of V-formations for long-distance flights. This led to the development of the "Stephenson formation," a variation of the V-formation that allowed for more efficient use of fuel.

The 1930s saw the introduction of radio communication, which greatly improved the coordination and communication required for formation flight. This led to the development of more complex formation patterns, such as the "finger-four" formation, which allowed for four aircraft to fly in a single-file line.

During World War II, formation flight was used extensively in combat situations, particularly in the Pacific Theater. The U.S. Navy developed the "Combat Wing," a formation that consisted of four aircraft flying in a diamond pattern, with the lead aircraft setting the course and the other three following in close formation. This formation was used for bombing missions, providing mutual support and protection for the aircraft.

After the war, formation flight continued to be studied and developed, with a focus on improving efficiency and survivability. The 1950s saw the introduction of the "Flying V" formation, a variation of the V-formation that allowed for even more efficient use of fuel.

In the 1960s, the development of advanced navigation and communication systems, such as the Global Positioning System (GPS), allowed for more precise and coordinated formation flight. This led to the development of more complex formation patterns, such as the "Combat Wing" formation, which allowed for eight aircraft to fly in a single-file line.

Today, formation flight continues to be studied and developed, with a focus on improving efficiency, survivability, and the integration of advanced technologies.

### Subsection 1.3a Navigation and Positioning Systems for Formation Flying

The navigation and positioning systems play a crucial role in the successful execution of autonomous formation flying. These systems are responsible for determining the position and orientation of the aircraft within the formation, as well as providing guidance for the aircraft to maintain its desired position and orientation.

#### 1.3a.1 Global Positioning System (GPS)

The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite-based navigation system that provides precise positioning and timing information. It consists of a network of satellites orbiting the Earth, which transmit signals containing their precise time and position. GPS receivers on the ground, such as those found in autonomous aircraft, use these signals to calculate their position and time.

In the context of autonomous formation flying, GPS is used for two main purposes: navigation and positioning. The navigation function of GPS allows the aircraft to determine its position and orientation relative to a known reference frame. This information is then used by the formation flight algorithms to calculate the desired trajectory for the aircraft.

The positioning function of GPS, on the other hand, is used for collision avoidance. By continuously monitoring the position and velocity of nearby aircraft, GPS can detect potential collisions and provide timely warnings to the pilot. This is particularly important in autonomous formation flying, where the aircraft may not have a direct line of sight to each other.

#### 1.3a.2 Inertial Navigation System (INS)

The Inertial Navigation System (INS) is a self-contained navigation system that uses accelerometers and gyroscopes to measure the acceleration and angular velocity of the aircraft. These measurements are then integrated over time to determine the position and orientation of the aircraft.

INS is particularly useful in situations where GPS signals may be unavailable or unreliable, such as in dense urban areas or during periods of signal interference. In these situations, INS can provide a backup navigation solution, allowing the aircraft to continue navigating and maintaining its position within the formation.

#### 1.3a.3 Integration of GPS and INS

While GPS and INS are both capable of providing navigation and positioning information, they are not without their limitations. GPS signals may be unavailable or unreliable in certain situations, while INS measurements can be prone to errors due to factors such as temperature changes and vibrations.

To overcome these limitations, the two systems are often integrated to provide a more robust and reliable navigation and positioning solution. This integration involves using both GPS and INS measurements to calculate the aircraft's position and orientation, with the system automatically switching between the two depending on which is more reliable at any given time.

In conclusion, the navigation and positioning systems play a crucial role in the successful execution of autonomous formation flying. By providing precise positioning and timing information, these systems enable the aircraft to navigate and maintain its position within the formation, as well as detect and avoid potential collisions. The integration of GPS and INS provides a robust and reliable navigation and positioning solution, further enhancing the capabilities of autonomous formation flying systems.





### Subsection 1.3b Communication and Coordination Systems for Formation Flying

In addition to navigation and positioning systems, autonomous formation flying also requires efficient communication and coordination systems. These systems are responsible for facilitating the exchange of information between the aircraft in the formation, allowing them to coordinate their movements and maintain formation.

#### 1.3b.1 Communication Systems

Communication systems play a crucial role in autonomous formation flying. They allow the aircraft to transmit and receive data, including information about their position, velocity, and status. This data is then used by the coordination systems to make decisions about the formation's trajectory and to issue commands to the aircraft.

There are several types of communication systems that can be used for autonomous formation flying, including:

- Radio Frequency (RF) communication: This is the most common type of communication system used in autonomous formation flying. It uses radio waves to transmit and receive data between the aircraft. RF communication can operate over long distances and is relatively immune to interference, making it suitable for use in complex airspace environments.

- Infrared (IR) communication: IR communication uses infrared light to transmit data between the aircraft. It is less susceptible to interference than RF communication, but its range is limited. IR communication is often used for short-range, high-speed data transmission.

- Visible Light Communication (VLC): VLC uses visible light to transmit data between the aircraft. It is a relatively new technology that offers high data rates and security, but its range is limited to line-of-sight. VLC is often used for applications that require high data rates, such as video transmission.

#### 1.3b.2 Coordination Systems

Coordination systems are responsible for managing the communication between the aircraft in the formation and making decisions about the formation's trajectory. They use the data received from the communication systems to calculate the desired trajectory for the formation and issue commands to the aircraft.

There are several types of coordination systems that can be used for autonomous formation flying, including:

- Centralized Coordination: In this system, all decisions about the formation's trajectory are made by a central node, such as a ground control station. The central node receives data from all the aircraft in the formation and uses it to calculate the desired trajectory. This system is simple and easy to implement, but it can be a single point of failure if the central node fails.

- Distributed Coordination: In this system, all decisions about the formation's trajectory are made by the aircraft themselves. Each aircraft in the formation communicates with its neighbors and uses the data received to calculate its own trajectory. This system is more complex than centralized coordination, but it is more resilient to failures and can handle larger formations.

- Hybrid Coordination: This system combines elements of both centralized and distributed coordination. The central node makes high-level decisions about the formation's trajectory, while the aircraft themselves make low-level decisions about their individual trajectories. This system offers the benefits of both centralized and distributed coordination.

In conclusion, efficient communication and coordination systems are essential for the successful execution of autonomous formation flying. They allow the aircraft to exchange information and coordinate their movements, ensuring the formation maintains its desired trajectory.




### Subsection 1.3c Sensor and Data Fusion for Formation Flying

In addition to communication and coordination systems, autonomous formation flying also requires advanced sensor and data fusion capabilities. These systems are responsible for processing and integrating data from various sensors to provide a comprehensive understanding of the formation's environment.

#### 1.3c.1 Sensor Systems

Sensor systems play a crucial role in autonomous formation flying. They provide the necessary data about the formation's environment, including other aircraft, terrain, and weather conditions. This data is then used by the data fusion system to make decisions about the formation's trajectory and to issue commands to the aircraft.

There are several types of sensors that can be used for autonomous formation flying, including:

- Radar: Radar systems use electromagnetic waves to detect and track other aircraft. They are particularly useful for long-range detection and can operate in all weather conditions.

- LiDAR: LiDAR systems use laser light to measure the distance to other aircraft or terrain. They are particularly useful for short-range, high-resolution detection.

- Infrared (IR) sensors: IR sensors use infrared light to detect other aircraft or terrain. They are particularly useful for detecting warm objects, such as other aircraft engines.

- Visual sensors: Visual sensors, such as cameras, use visible light to detect other aircraft or terrain. They are particularly useful for identifying and classifying objects.

#### 1.3c.2 Data Fusion Systems

Data fusion systems are responsible for processing and integrating data from various sensors to provide a comprehensive understanding of the formation's environment. They use advanced algorithms and techniques to combine data from different sensors and to filter out irrelevant or noisy data.

There are several types of data fusion systems that can be used for autonomous formation flying, including:

- Kalman filter: The Kalman filter is a recursive algorithm that estimates the state of a system based on noisy measurements. It is commonly used in navigation and control systems.

- Particle filter: The particle filter is a non-parametric algorithm that estimates the state of a system based on a set of particles. It is particularly useful for systems with non-linear dynamics or non-Gaussian noise.

- Dempster-Shafer theory: Dempster-Shafer theory is a mathematical framework for combining evidence from multiple sources. It is particularly useful for systems with uncertain or incomplete information.

In the next section, we will discuss the challenges and considerations for implementing sensor and data fusion systems in autonomous formation flying.




### Subsection 1.3d Fault Tolerance and Safety Measures for Formation Flying

As with any complex system, autonomous formation flying systems must be designed with fault tolerance and safety measures in mind. These measures are crucial for ensuring the safe and reliable operation of the system, especially in the event of unexpected failures or malfunctions.

#### 1.3d.1 Fault Tolerance

Fault tolerance refers to the ability of a system to continue functioning correctly in the event of a failure or malfunction. In the context of autonomous formation flying, fault tolerance is essential for ensuring the safety of the formation and its occupants.

One approach to achieving fault tolerance is through the use of redundancy. Redundancy involves duplicating critical components of the system, such as sensors or control systems, to ensure that the system can continue functioning even if one component fails. This approach can be particularly useful in the context of autonomous formation flying, where the loss of a single aircraft could have catastrophic consequences.

Another approach to fault tolerance is through the use of error detection and correction techniques. These techniques involve monitoring the system for errors and correcting them as necessary. This can be achieved through the use of error detection codes, such as parity codes or cyclic redundancy checks, which can detect and correct single-bit errors.

#### 1.3d.2 Safety Measures

In addition to fault tolerance, autonomous formation flying systems must also be designed with safety measures in mind. These measures are intended to prevent accidents and minimize their impact in the event of an incident.

One important safety measure is the implementation of fail-safe mechanisms. These are systems or procedures that are designed to prevent or mitigate the effects of a failure. For example, in the event of a sensor failure, a fail-safe mechanism could involve relying on data from other sensors or using backup sensors.

Another important safety measure is the implementation of safety certificates. These are documents that provide evidence of the safety of a system or component. They can be used to demonstrate compliance with safety standards and regulations, and can be particularly useful in the context of autonomous formation flying, where safety is of utmost importance.

In conclusion, fault tolerance and safety measures are crucial considerations in the design and implementation of autonomous formation flying systems. By incorporating these measures into the system, we can ensure the safe and reliable operation of the system, even in the event of unexpected failures or malfunctions.

#### 2.4a Principles of Autonomous Control Systems

Autonomous control systems are a crucial component of modern air transportation systems. They are designed to manage and control various aspects of the system, from individual aircraft to entire networks. The principles of autonomous control systems are based on the concept of hierarchical control, where multiple control-loop layers work together to achieve a desired outcome.

#### Hierarchical Control in Autonomous Systems

Hierarchical control systems are designed to decompose the behavior of a system into manageable "chunks", or states, with known transitions. This approach is particularly useful in the context of autonomous control, where the system needs to handle a wide range of complex tasks.

The low-layer loops in a hierarchical control system, such as those used for flight control, operate at a high frequency, often ticking as fast as 32,000 times per second. Higher-level loops, on the other hand, may cycle once per second. This layered approach allows for the efficient management of the system's behavior, with each layer responsible for a specific aspect of the system.

#### Mid-Layer Algorithms in Autonomous Systems

Mid-layer algorithms play a crucial role in autonomous control systems. They are responsible for managing the transitions between different states and ensuring that the system behaves in a predictable manner. Examples of mid-layer algorithms include evolved UAV hierarchical task planners, which use methods like state tree searches or genetic algorithms.

#### Autonomy Features and Functions

Autonomous control systems offer a wide range of features and functions. Some of these, such as airborne refueling or ground-based battery switching, are specific tasks that can be handled by the system. Others, such as higher-level tasks, require greater computing, sensing, and actuating capabilities.

One way to quantify the autonomous capabilities of a system is based on the OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) terminology. This approach, suggested by a 2002 US Air Force Research Laboratory, categorizes the system's capabilities into four levels: perception, cognition, decision, and action. Each level represents a different level of autonomy, with higher levels requiring more complex and sophisticated systems.

#### Reactive Autonomy in Air Transportation Systems

Reactive autonomy, such as collective flight, real-time collision avoidance, wall following, and corridor centring, relies on telecommunication and situational awareness provided by range sensors. These sensors, which include optic flow, lidars, radars, and sonars, analyze electromagnetic radiation reflected off the environment to provide the system with information about its surroundings.

In conclusion, the principles of autonomous control systems are based on the concept of hierarchical control, where multiple control-loop layers work together to achieve a desired outcome. Mid-layer algorithms play a crucial role in managing the transitions between different states, while reactive autonomy relies on telecommunication and situational awareness provided by range sensors.

#### 2.4b Designing Autonomous Control Systems

Designing autonomous control systems is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of the system's behavior, the environment in which it operates, and the tasks it needs to perform. The design process involves several steps, including system modeling, control system design, and system implementation.

#### System Modeling in Autonomous Control

System modeling is a crucial step in the design of autonomous control systems. It involves creating a mathematical model of the system that accurately represents its behavior. This model is then used to design the control system and to simulate the system's behavior under different conditions.

The system model is typically represented as a set of differential equations that describe the system's dynamics. These equations are derived from the physical laws that govern the system's behavior, such as Newton's second law of motion for mechanical systems, or the Kirchhoff's laws for electrical systems.

#### Control System Design in Autonomous Control

Once the system model has been created, the next step is to design the control system. This involves determining the control objectives, selecting the control strategy, and designing the control law.

The control objectives define what the system needs to achieve. For example, in an autonomous aircraft, the control objectives might include maintaining a stable flight, avoiding collisions, and following a predefined flight path.

The control strategy determines how the control objectives are achieved. This can involve using a feedback control system, where the control action is determined based on the system's current state, or a feedforward control system, where the control action is determined based on the expected future state of the system.

The control law is the mathematical expression that defines how the control action is calculated. This law is typically derived from the system model and the control objectives.

#### System Implementation in Autonomous Control

The final step in the design process is system implementation. This involves implementing the control system in the actual system. This can involve programming the control algorithms into the system's controllers, configuring the system's sensors and actuators, and testing the system's behavior under different conditions.

System implementation also involves integrating the control system with the rest of the system. This can be a complex task, as the control system needs to interact with other systems and subsystems, such as navigation systems, communication systems, and power systems.

In conclusion, designing autonomous control systems is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of the system's behavior, the environment in which it operates, and the tasks it needs to perform. However, with the right tools and techniques, it is possible to design effective and efficient autonomous control systems for a wide range of applications.

#### Levels of Autonomy in Air Transportation Systems

The levels of autonomy in air transportation systems can be broadly categorized into three levels: basic, advanced, and full.

Basic autonomy is achieved through the use of proprioceptive sensors, which provide the aircraft with a basic understanding of its own state and position. This level of autonomy is sufficient for tasks such as maintaining a stable flight path or avoiding obstacles.

Advanced autonomy, on the other hand, requires the integration of exteroceptive sensors, which provide the aircraft with information about its environment. This allows the aircraft to make more complex decisions, such as choosing the most efficient flight path or avoiding other aircraft.

Full autonomy is achieved when the aircraft is capable of performing all tasks without human intervention. This level of autonomy requires advanced algorithms and artificial intelligence to handle complex tasks and make decisions.

#### Functions of Autonomous Control Systems

Autonomous control systems in air transportation systems perform a wide range of functions. These functions can be broadly categorized into three areas: navigation, control, and decision-making.

Navigation functions involve the use of sensors and algorithms to determine the aircraft's position and navigate to a desired location. This includes tasks such as maintaining a stable flight path, avoiding obstacles, and following a predetermined route.

Control functions involve the use of actuators and control algorithms to control the aircraft's movement. This includes tasks such as adjusting the aircraft's speed, altitude, and orientation.

Decision-making functions involve the use of artificial intelligence and advanced algorithms to make decisions and perform complex tasks. This includes tasks such as choosing the most efficient flight path, avoiding other aircraft, and making decisions based on changing environmental conditions.

#### Quantifying Autonomous Capabilities

The level of autonomy and the functions performed by an autonomous control system can be quantified using various metrics. One such metric is the OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) loop, which measures the system's ability to observe and interpret its environment, orient itself based on that information, make a decision, and act on it.

Another metric is the Sense-Plan-Act (SPA) cycle, which measures the system's ability to sense its environment, plan a course of action, and act on it. This metric is particularly useful for evaluating the system's decision-making capabilities.

In conclusion, the levels of autonomy and functions performed by autonomous control systems in air transportation systems are crucial for the efficient and safe operation of these systems. By understanding these levels and functions, we can design and implement more effective and efficient autonomous control systems.





#### 2.4c Decision Making and Planning in Autonomous Systems

Safety in autonomous systems refers to the ability of the system to operate without causing harm to its users or the environment. This includes the safety of the system's hardware, software, and the decisions and actions it takes.

In the context of air transportation systems, safety is often achieved through the use of fail-safe mechanisms. These are systems or processes that are designed to prevent or mitigate the effects of failures in the system. For example, a fail-safe mechanism might involve the use of redundant sensors to detect and correct errors in the system's perception of its environment.

#### Redundancy in Autonomous Systems

Redundancy in autonomous systems refers to the presence of backup systems or processes that can take over the functions of the primary system in the event of a failure. This is often achieved through the use of multiple instances of the same system, or through the use of different systems that can perform the same function.

In the context of air transportation systems, redundancy is often achieved through the use of multiple sensors and control systems. For example, a commercial aircraft might use multiple sensors to detect its position and orientation, and multiple control systems to control its flight. This redundancy allows the system to continue functioning even if one of its components fails.

#### Safety and Redundancy in Autonomous Control

In the context of autonomous control, safety and redundancy are achieved through the use of multiple control systems and the integration of these systems with the system's perception and decision-making processes.

For example, an autonomous aircraft might use multiple control systems to control its flight, each of which is responsible for a different aspect of the flight. These systems might include a primary control system that is responsible for maintaining the aircraft's altitude and heading, and a secondary control system that is responsible for maintaining the aircraft's speed and fuel efficiency.

In addition, the aircraft might use multiple sensors to perceive its environment, and integrate this perception with its decision-making processes. For example, the aircraft might use radar and satellite navigation systems to determine its position and orientation, and integrate this information with its decision-making processes to make decisions about its navigation and control.

By using multiple control systems and integrating these systems with the system's perception and decision-making processes, the aircraft can maintain its safety and continue functioning even in the event of a failure in one of its components.

#### 2.6b Navigation and Positioning Techniques in Air Transportation Systems

Navigation and positioning techniques are crucial for the successful operation of air transportation systems. These techniques are used to determine the position and orientation of the aircraft in space, and to guide it along its intended path. In this section, we will discuss the various navigation and positioning techniques used in air transportation systems.

#### Global Positioning System (GPS)

The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a satellite-based navigation system that provides precise positioning and timing information to GPS-enabled devices. In the context of air transportation systems, GPS is used for a variety of purposes, including navigation, tracking, and communication.

GPS works by using a network of satellites to determine the position of a GPS receiver on the ground. The receiver calculates its position by measuring the time it takes for signals to travel from three or more satellites to the receiver. This time measurement is then used to calculate the distance to each satellite, which can be used to determine the receiver's position.

In the context of air transportation systems, GPS is used for a variety of purposes. For example, it is used for en-route navigation, where it provides precise guidance to the aircraft along its intended path. It is also used for approach and landing, where it provides guidance to the aircraft as it approaches and lands at an airport.

#### Performance-Based Navigation (PBN)

Performance-based navigation (PBN) is a navigation technique that allows for more precise navigation than traditional methods. PBN is based on the concept of performance requirements, which define the minimum performance that an aircraft must meet in order to navigate along a specific path.

PBN is currently being implemented in the United States and Europe, and it is expected to become the standard for navigation in the future. It is likely that PBN will progress from 2-dimensional to 3-dimensional/4-dimensional applications, although the time-scales and operational requirements are currently difficult to determine.

#### Extended Kalman Filter

The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is a mathematical algorithm used for state estimation in control systems. It is used in air transportation systems for a variety of purposes, including navigation and control.

The EKF works by using a mathematical model of the system to predict the state of the system at the next time step. It then uses sensor measurements to correct this prediction, resulting in an updated estimate of the system's state. This process is repeated at each time step, resulting in a continuous update of the system's state.

In the context of air transportation systems, the EKF is used for navigation and control. For example, it is used for navigation in situations where GPS is not available, and for control in situations where the aircraft's position and orientation need to be precisely controlled.

#### Conclusion

In this section, we have discussed the various navigation and positioning techniques used in air transportation systems. These techniques are crucial for the successful operation of these systems, and they are constantly evolving to meet the demands of modern air transportation. As technology continues to advance, we can expect to see even more sophisticated navigation and positioning techniques being developed and implemented in air transportation systems.





#### 2.6c Control Systems Design and Analysis

Control systems play a crucial role in air transportation systems, ensuring the safe and efficient operation of aircraft. In this section, we will discuss the principles of control systems design and analysis, and how they are applied in the context of air transportation systems.

#### Control Systems Design

The design of a control system involves the selection and integration of various components, including sensors, actuators, and control algorithms. The goal of control systems design is to create a system that can accurately and efficiently control the behavior of the aircraft.

One approach to control systems design is the use of higher-order sinusoidal input describing functions (HOSIDFs). These functions are advantageous in both cases where a nonlinear model is already identified and when no model is known yet. They require little model assumptions and can easily be identified while requiring no advanced mathematical tools. Moreover, even when a model is already identified, the analysis of the HOSIDFs often yields significant advantages over the use of the identified nonlinear model.

Another approach to control systems design is the use of backstepping. This recursive procedure can be used to stabilize multiple-integrator systems, which are common in air transportation systems. By breaking down the system into smaller, already-stabilized subsystems, backstepping can be used to create a stabilized multiple-integrator system.

#### Control Systems Analysis

Once a control system has been designed, it must be analyzed to ensure its performance meets the required specifications. This involves testing the system under various conditions and evaluating its response.

One method of control systems analysis is the use of factory automation infrastructure. This involves the use of automation tools and techniques to test and analyze the control system. By automating the testing process, factory automation infrastructure can save time and resources, and provide more accurate and reliable results.

Another method of control systems analysis is the use of many-integrator backstepping. This recursive procedure can be used to stabilize multiple-integrator systems, and can be formally proved using mathematical induction. By building up a stabilized multiple-integrator system from subsystems of already-stabilized multiple-integrator subsystems, many-integrator backstepping can provide a systematic approach to control systems analysis.

In conclusion, control systems design and analysis are crucial aspects of air transportation systems architecting. By using advanced techniques such as HOSIDFs and backstepping, and by leveraging automation tools and techniques, we can create and analyze control systems that meet the demanding requirements of air transportation systems.

One approach to performance evaluation is the use of higher-order sinusoidal input describing functions (HOSIDFs). These functions allow for the analysis of the system's response to nonlinear inputs, which are common in air transportation systems. By analyzing the HOSIDFs, engineers can gain insights into the system's behavior and identify areas for improvement.

Another approach to performance evaluation is the use of factory automation infrastructure. This involves the use of automation tools and techniques to test and evaluate the GNC system. By automating the testing process, engineers can quickly assess the system's performance under various conditions and identify areas for improvement.

#### Optimization

Optimization is a key aspect of performance evaluation and optimization of GNC systems. It involves the implementation of techniques to improve the system's performance and efficiency. This can include the use of advanced control algorithms, the optimization of system parameters, and the integration of new technologies.

One approach to optimization is the use of backstepping. This recursive procedure can be used to stabilize multiple-integrator systems, which are common in air transportation systems. By breaking down the system into smaller, already-stabilized subsystems, backstepping can be used to create a stabilized multiple-integrator system.

Another approach to optimization is the use of evolutionary algorithms. These algorithms, inspired by natural selection and genetics, can be used to optimize system parameters and improve the system's performance. By iteratively improving the system's performance, engineers can achieve significant improvements in the system's efficiency and effectiveness.

In conclusion, the performance evaluation and optimization of GNC systems is a critical aspect of air transportation systems architecting and design.

 # Safety culture

## Ideal culture

James Reason has suggested that safety culture consists of five elements: 

Reason considers an ideal safety culture "the ‘engine’ that drives the system towards the goal of sustaining the maximum resistance towards its operational hazards" regardless of current commercial concerns or leadership style. This requires a constant high level of respect for anything that might defeat safety systems and ‘not forgetting to be afraid’. Complex systems with defence-in-depth (such as would be expected for a major hazard plant) become opaque to most if not all of their managers and operators. Their design should ensure that no single failure will lead to an accident, or even to a revealed near-miss, and there are no timely reminders to be afraid. For such systems, Reason argues, there is an ‘absence of sufficient accidents to steer by’ and the desired state of ‘intelligent and respectful wariness’ will be lost unless sustained by the collection, analysis and

### Subsection: 6.5a Review of Autonomous Flight Control Systems

Autonomous flight control systems are a critical component of modern air transportation systems. These systems are designed to enable aircraft to operate without human intervention, reducing the need for human pilots and increasing efficiency. In this section, we will review the basic principles of autonomous flight control systems and discuss their role in the overall architecture of air transportation systems.

#### 6.5a.1 Basic Principles

Autonomous flight control systems are designed to mimic the actions of a human pilot, but with the added advantage of being able to process and interpret information much faster than a human. This is achieved through the use of advanced algorithms and sensors that provide the system with a comprehensive understanding of the aircraft's environment.

One way to achieve autonomous control employs multiple control-loop layers, as in hierarchical control systems. As of 2016, the low-layer loops (i.e., for flight control) tick as fast as 32,000 times per second, while higher-level loops may cycle once per second. The principle is to decompose the aircraft's behavior into manageable "chunks", or states, with known transitions. Hierarchical control system types range from simple scripts to finite state machines, behavior trees, and hierarchical task planners. The most common control mechanism used in these layers is the PID controller, which can be used to achieve hover for a quadcopter by using data from the IMU to calculate precise inputs for the electronic speed controllers and motors.

#### 6.5a.2 Mid-Layer Algorithms

Examples of mid-layer algorithms include evolved UAV hierarchical task planners that use methods like state tree searches or genetic algorithms. These algorithms are designed to handle more complex tasks that require a deeper understanding of the aircraft's environment.

#### 6.5a.3 Autonomy Features

UAV manufacturers often build in specific autonomous operations, such as airborne refueling or ground-based battery switching. These features are made possible by the advanced algorithms and sensors used in autonomous flight control systems.

#### 6.5a.4 Functions

Full autonomy is available for specific tasks, such as airborne refueling or ground-based battery switching. However, higher-level tasks, such as mission planning and decision-making, require greater computing, sensing, and actuating capabilities. One approach to quantifying autonomous capabilities is based on OODA terminology, as suggested by a 2002 US Air Force Research Laboratory, and used in the table below:

| OODA Level | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Basic autonomy |
| 2 | Advanced autonomy |
| 3 | Full autonomy |

#### 6.5a.5 Reactive Autonomy

Reactive autonomy, such as collective flight, real-time collision avoidance, wall following, and corridor centring, relies on telecommunication and situational awareness provided by range sensors. These sensors, such as optic flow, lidars, radars, and sonars, analyze electromagnetic radiation reflected off objects in the aircraft's environment. This allows the autonomous flight control system to make real-time decisions and adjust the aircraft's behavior accordingly.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the software aspects of autonomous flight control systems, discussing the various software components and their roles in the overall system.
