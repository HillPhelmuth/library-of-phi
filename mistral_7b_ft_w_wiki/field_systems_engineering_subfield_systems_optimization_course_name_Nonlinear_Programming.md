## Foreward

Welcome to "Nonlinear Programming: Theory and Applications"! This book aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of nonlinear programming, a powerful tool used in various fields such as engineering, economics, and machine learning.

Nonlinear programming is a branch of mathematical optimization that deals with finding the minimum or maximum of a nonlinear function. Unlike linear programming, where the objective function and constraints are linear, nonlinear programming allows for more complex and realistic models of real-world problems. This makes it a valuable tool for solving a wide range of problems, from optimizing manufacturing processes to training neural networks.

In this book, we will explore the theory behind nonlinear programming, starting with the basics of convexity and optimization. We will then delve into the different types of nonlinear programming problems, including unconstrained and constrained optimization, and discuss various methods for solving them. We will also cover topics such as sensitivity analysis and duality, which are essential for understanding the behavior of nonlinear programming problems.

One of the key algorithms we will focus on is the αΒΒ algorithm, a second-order deterministic global optimization algorithm. This algorithm is particularly useful for finding the optima of general, twice continuously differentiable functions. We will discuss the theory behind the αΒΒ algorithm and its applications in various fields.

To assist you in your journey through nonlinear programming, we have provided a context that will serve as a starting point for your exploration. This context includes a brief introduction to the αΒΒ algorithm and its applications, as well as a discussion on the calculation of the α vector. We encourage you to expand on this context and explore the vast world of nonlinear programming.

We hope that this book will serve as a valuable resource for students, researchers, and practitioners alike, and we look forward to seeing the impact it will have in the field of nonlinear programming. Thank you for joining us on this journey.

Happy optimizing!

Sincerely,
[Your Name]

### Introduction

Nonlinear programming is a powerful tool used in various fields such as engineering, economics, and machine learning. It is a mathematical optimization technique that deals with finding the minimum or maximum of a nonlinear function. In this chapter, we will focus on unconstrained optimization, which is a fundamental concept in nonlinear programming.

Unconstrained optimization is a type of optimization where there are no constraints on the decision variables. This means that the decision variables can take on any value in their domain. The goal of unconstrained optimization is to find the optimal solution, which is the value of the decision variables that minimizes or maximizes the objective function.

In this chapter, we will cover the basics of unconstrained optimization, including the different types of objective functions and the methods used to solve them. We will also discuss the challenges and limitations of unconstrained optimization and how to overcome them. Additionally, we will explore real-world applications of unconstrained optimization and how it can be used to solve complex problems.

Overall, this chapter aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of unconstrained optimization and its applications. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid foundation in unconstrained optimization and be able to apply it to various real-world problems. So let's dive into the world of nonlinear programming and explore the fascinating concepts of unconstrained optimization.




### Section: 1.1 Optimality Conditions:

Optimality conditions are mathematical conditions that must be satisfied by the optimal solution of a nonlinear programming problem. These conditions provide a way to determine whether a given solution is optimal or not. In this section, we will discuss the different types of optimality conditions and their significance in nonlinear programming.

#### 1.1a Local Optimality Conditions

Local optimality conditions are used to determine whether a solution is optimal in a local sense. This means that the solution is optimal in a small neighborhood around the current point. The most commonly used local optimality conditions are the first-order and second-order conditions.

The first-order optimality condition, also known as the gradient condition, states that the gradient of the objective function at the optimal solution must be equal to zero. This condition can be written as:

$$
\nabla f(x^*) = 0
$$

where $f(x)$ is the objective function and $x^*$ is the optimal solution. This condition ensures that the optimal solution is a stationary point, where the slope of the objective function is zero.

The second-order optimality condition, also known as the Hessian condition, states that the Hessian matrix of the objective function at the optimal solution must be positive semi-definite. This condition can be written as:

$$
\nabla^2 f(x^*) \geq 0
$$

where $\nabla^2 f(x)$ is the Hessian matrix of the objective function. This condition ensures that the optimal solution is a local minimum, where the second derivative of the objective function is non-negative.

#### 1.1b Global Optimality Conditions

Global optimality conditions are used to determine whether a solution is optimal in a global sense. This means that the solution is optimal for the entire problem, not just in a small neighborhood. The most commonly used global optimality conditions are the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and the Slater's condition.

The KKT conditions are a set of necessary conditions for optimality. They state that at the optimal solution, the gradient of the objective function must be equal to the gradient of the constraints, and the constraints must be active. This can be written as:

$$
\nabla f(x^*) = \sum_{i=1}^m \lambda_i^* \nabla g_i(x^*)
$$

$$
g_i(x^*) = 0, \quad i = 1,2,...,m
$$

where $f(x)$ is the objective function, $g_i(x)$ are the constraints, and $\lambda_i^*$ are the dual variables. These conditions ensure that the optimal solution is a saddle point, where the gradient of the objective function is equal to the gradient of the constraints.

The Slater's condition states that if the constraints are strictly feasible, then the optimal solution must be a global minimum. This condition can be written as:

$$
\exists x \in X: g_i(x) < 0, \quad i = 1,2,...,m
$$

where $X$ is the feasible region. This condition ensures that the optimal solution is a global minimum, where the constraints are strictly satisfied.

#### 1.1c Sensitivity Analysis

Sensitivity analysis is a technique used to determine the effect of changes in the input parameters on the optimal solution. This is important in nonlinear programming as the optimal solution may change significantly with small changes in the input parameters. The most commonly used sensitivity analysis techniques are the first-order and second-order sensitivity analysis.

The first-order sensitivity analysis states that the change in the optimal solution with respect to a small change in the input parameter is equal to the partial derivative of the objective function with respect to that parameter. This can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial x^*}{\partial p} = \frac{\partial f(x^*)}{\partial p}
$$

where $p$ is the input parameter and $x^*$ is the optimal solution. This analysis ensures that the optimal solution is sensitive to changes in the input parameters.

The second-order sensitivity analysis states that the change in the optimal solution with respect to a small change in the input parameter is equal to the second derivative of the objective function with respect to that parameter. This can be written as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 x^*}{\partial p^2} = \frac{\partial^2 f(x^*)}{\partial p^2}
$$

where $p$ is the input parameter and $x^*$ is the optimal solution. This analysis ensures that the optimal solution is sensitive to changes in the input parameters.

In conclusion, optimality conditions play a crucial role in determining the optimal solution of a nonlinear programming problem. They provide a way to check whether a given solution is optimal or not, and also help in understanding the sensitivity of the optimal solution to changes in the input parameters. In the next section, we will discuss the different methods used to solve nonlinear programming problems.

### Proof by Lagrangian multipliers

If any of the <math>x_i</math> are <math>0</math>, then there is nothing to prove. So we may assume all the <math>x_i</math> are strictly positive.

Because the arithmetic and geometric means are homogeneous of degree 1, without loss of generality assume that <math>\prod_{i=1}^n x_i = 1</math>. Set <math>G(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)=\prod_{i=1}^n x_i</math>, and <math>F(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i</math>. The inequality will be proved (together with the equality case) if we can show that the minimum of <math>F(x_1,x_2...,x_n),</math> subject to the constraint <math>G(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n) = 1,</math> is equal to <math>1</math>, and the minimum is only achieved when <math>x_1 = x_2 = \cdots = x_n = 1</math>. Let us first show that the constrained minimization problem has a global minimum.

Set <math>K = \{(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n) \colon 0 \leq x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n \leq n\}</math>. Since the intersection <math>K \cap \{G = 1\}</math> is compact, the extreme value theorem guarantees that the minimum of <math>F(x_1,x_2...,x_n)</math> subject to the constraints <math>G(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n) = 1</math> and <math> (x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n) \in K </math> is attained at some point inside <math>K</math>. On the other hand, observe that if any of the <math>x_i > n</math>, then <math>F(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n) > 1 </math>, while <math>F(1,1,\ldots,1) = 1</math>, and <math>(1,1,\ldots,1) \in K \cap \{G = 1\} </math>. This means that the minimum inside <math>K \cap \{G = 1\}</math> is in fact a global minimum, since the value of <math>F</math> at any point inside <math>K \cap \{G = 1\}</math> is certainly no smaller than the minimum, and the value of <math>F</math> at any point <math>(y_1,y_2,\ldots, y_n)</math> not inside <math>K</math> is strictly bigger than the value at <math>(1,1,\ldots,1)</math>. This proves that the minimum of <math>F(x_1,x_2...,x_n)</math> subject to the constraint <math>G(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n) = 1</math> is equal to <math>1</math>, and the minimum is only achieved when <math>x_1 = x_2 = \cdots = x_n = 1</math>.

Now, let us consider the case where <math>x_i = 0</math> for some <math>i</math>. In this case, the inequality <math>F(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n) \leq 1</math> is clearly satisfied, since <math>F(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n) = 0</math>. Therefore, the minimum of <math>F(x_1,x_2...,x_n)</math> subject to the constraint <math>G(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n) = 1</math> is equal to <math>1</math>, and the minimum is only achieved when <math>x_1 = x_2 = \cdots = x_n = 1</math>. This proves the AM-GM inequality.

### Conclusion

In this section, we have proven the AM-GM inequality using the method of Lagrangian multipliers. We have shown that the minimum of <math>F(x_1,x_2...,x_n)</math> subject to the constraint <math>G(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n) = 1</math> is equal to <math>1</math>, and the minimum is only achieved when <math>x_1 = x_2 = \cdots = x_n = 1</math>. This proves the AM-GM inequality, which states that the arithmetic mean of a set of positive numbers is less than or equal to the geometric mean. This inequality has many applications in mathematics and other fields, and it is a fundamental concept in nonlinear programming.
