## Foreward

Welcome to "Exploring the Dynamics of Complex Systems: A Comprehensive Guide to the Pre-Cambrian Coevolution". This book aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex systems that existed during the Pre-Cambrian era and the coevolutionary processes that shaped them.

The Pre-Cambrian era, spanning from approximately 4.6 billion to 541 million years ago, is a time period of immense interest to geologists and biologists. It was during this era that the Earth's crust began to solidify, the first signs of life emerged, and the processes of evolution and coevolution began to shape the world as we know it today.

In this book, we will delve into the fascinating world of the Pre-Cambrian, exploring the dynamics of complex systems that existed during this time. We will examine the coevolutionary processes that shaped these systems, and how they led to the diversity of life we see today.

The study of coevolution is a complex and multifaceted field, and it is one that has been greatly enhanced by the use of digital organisms. These digital organisms allow us to study evolutionary processes in a controlled and detailed manner, providing insights that would not be possible with natural ecosystems.

We will also explore the concept of the "stability-diversity debate", a long-standing debate about whether more diverse ecological networks are also more stable. Through the use of mathematical models and digital networks, we will uncover the rules shaping the web of interactions among species and their coevolutionary processes.

### Introduction

The study of the Earth's history is a vast and complex field, with many different aspects to explore. One of the most intriguing periods in this history is the Proterozoic-Phanerozoic transition, a time period spanning over 2 billion years. This transition marked a significant shift in the Earth's geochemical processes, leading to the development of the modern biogeochemical cycles.

In this chapter, we will delve into the geochemical signals of this transition, exploring the changes that occurred in the Earth's chemical composition and how they influenced the evolution of life. We will also examine the role of geochemical processes in shaping the Earth's surface and atmosphere, and how these processes continue to shape our planet today.

The study of geochemical signals is a multidisciplinary field, combining elements of geology, chemistry, and biology. It requires a deep understanding of the Earth's systems and the interactions between them. By exploring the geochemical signals of the Proterozoic-Phanerozoic transition, we can gain valuable insights into the dynamics of complex systems and the coevolution of life and the Earth.

Join us as we embark on this journey of exploration and discovery, unraveling the mysteries of the Earth's past and present, and gaining a deeper understanding of the processes that shape our planet.




### Subsection: 1.1a Biogeochemical Cycles in the Proterozoic Eon

The Proterozoic Eon, spanning from 2.5 billion to 541 million years ago, was a time of significant changes in the Earth's biogeochemical cycles. These cycles, which involve the movement of elements and compounds between the Earth's surface, atmosphere, and interior, play a crucial role in shaping the planet's environment and supporting life.

#### The Selli Event

One of the most significant events during the Proterozoic Eon was the Selli Event, a period of intense volcanic activity that occurred approximately 2.01 billion years ago. This event, named after the Selli Formation in Western Australia where it was first discovered, was characterized by the release of large amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere. The Selli Event is believed to have been caused by the release of volcanic gases from the Earth's mantle, which reacted with seawater to form hydrochloric acid and other corrosive compounds.

The Selli Event had a profound impact on the Earth's biogeochemical cycles. The release of carbon dioxide and other gases led to a spike in the Earth's atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, which in turn caused a rise in global temperatures. This increase in temperature led to changes in the Earth's ocean chemistry, including a drop in seawater pH and an increase in hydrogen sulphide levels. These changes had a significant impact on marine life, leading to the extinction of some species and the evolution of others.

#### The Great Oxidation Event

Another significant event during the Proterozoic Eon was the Great Oxidation Event, which occurred approximately 2.4 billion years ago. This event marked a significant increase in the amount of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere, from less than 0.1% to approximately 10%. This increase in oxygen levels was driven by the evolution of photosynthetic bacteria, which began producing oxygen as a byproduct of their metabolism.

The Great Oxidation Event had a profound impact on the Earth's biogeochemical cycles. The increase in oxygen levels led to changes in the Earth's ocean chemistry, including a decrease in hydrogen sulphide levels and an increase in nutrient availability. These changes supported the evolution of more complex forms of life, including eukaryotes and multicellular organisms.

#### The Proterozoic-Phanerozoic Transition

The Proterozoic-Phanerozoic transition, which occurred approximately 541 million years ago, marked the end of the Proterozoic Eon and the beginning of the Phanerozoic Eon. This transition was characterized by a series of significant changes in the Earth's biogeochemical cycles, including a further increase in oxygen levels, a drop in carbon dioxide levels, and a shift in the Earth's nutrient cycles.

The Proterozoic-Phanerozoic transition was driven by a combination of factors, including changes in the Earth's plate tectonics, the evolution of new forms of life, and the continued release of volcanic gases. These changes led to a reorganization of the Earth's biogeochemical cycles, setting the stage for the diversification of life during the Phanerozoic Eon.

In the next section, we will explore the geochemical signals of the Proterozoic-Phanerozoic transition in more detail, examining the changes in the Earth's biogeochemical cycles and their impact on the evolution of life.





### Subsection: 1.1b Impacts of Environmental Changes on Biogeochemical Cycles

The environmental changes brought about by the Selli Event and the Great Oxidation Event had a profound impact on the Earth's biogeochemical cycles. The release of carbon dioxide and other gases during the Selli Event led to a spike in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, which in turn caused a rise in global temperatures. This increase in temperature led to changes in the Earth's ocean chemistry, including a drop in seawater pH and an increase in hydrogen sulphide levels. These changes had a significant impact on marine life, leading to the extinction of some species and the evolution of others.

The Great Oxidation Event, on the other hand, led to a significant increase in the amount of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere. This increase in oxygen levels was driven by the evolution of photosynthetic bacteria, which began producing oxygen as a byproduct of their metabolism. This increase in oxygen levels had a profound impact on the Earth's biogeochemical cycles, as it allowed for the development of more complex forms of life and the expansion of the oxygenic photosynthesis niche.

The increase in oxygen levels also led to changes in the Earth's ocean chemistry. The increased oxygen levels in the atmosphere led to an increase in the amount of oxygen dissolved in the ocean, which in turn led to an increase in the amount of sulphate available for biological sulphate reduction. This increase in sulphate availability led to an increase in hydrogen sulphide production, which in turn increased phosphorus availability in the water column by inhibiting its burial on the seafloor and enabled the development of anoxia.

The large-scale volcanic release of carbon dioxide during the Selli Event also caused a drop in the pH of seawater at the start of the event, as much of this excess carbon dioxide was absorbed by the ocean and dissolved as carbonic acid. This drop in pH led to a decrease in the carbonate-saturation of seawater, which lasted for approximately 0.85 Myr. This ocean acidification had a significant impact on marine life, particularly on organisms that rely on calcium carbonate to build their shells or skeletons.

In conclusion, the environmental changes brought about by the Selli Event and the Great Oxidation Event had a profound impact on the Earth's biogeochemical cycles. These changes led to significant shifts in the Earth's ocean chemistry and atmosphere, which in turn had a profound impact on marine life and the development of complex systems.

### Subsection: 1.1c The Role of Microorganisms in Biogeochemical Cycling

Microorganisms play a crucial role in the biogeochemical cycling of elements and compounds on Earth. They are responsible for driving organic and inorganic compound transformations in the terrestrial subsurface, which is the largest reservoir of carbon on Earth. This subsurface environment is home to a diverse array of microorganisms, many of which have yet to be fully characterized and understood.

The study of microorganisms in the subsurface is primarily based on 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences. However, current knowledge of the microbial ecology of the subsurface is limited, with only a small fraction of 16S rRNA sequences in public databases derived from subsurface organisms. This lack of information is due to the difficulty of studying these organisms, as they are often difficult to cultivate and study in the laboratory.

Recent advances in genome-resolved metagenomics, an approach that can yield a comprehensive set of draft and even complete genomes for organisms without the requirement for laboratory isolation, have the potential to provide a more comprehensive understanding of microbial metabolism in the subsurface. This approach could help to resolve the metabolic interaction networks that underpin subsurface ecosystems, which are currently not fully understood.

Some of the more well-known biogeochemical cycles, such as the carbon cycle, nitrogen cycle, and sulphur cycle, are all influenced by microorganisms. For example, in the carbon cycle, microorganisms are responsible for the transformation of carbon compounds, including the production of methane and carbon dioxide. In the nitrogen cycle, microorganisms play a crucial role in the fixation and denitrification of nitrogen, while in the sulphur cycle, they are responsible for the reduction and oxidation of sulphur compounds.

The environmental changes brought about by the Selli Event and the Great Oxidation Event had a profound impact on these biogeochemical cycles. The release of carbon dioxide and other gases during the Selli Event led to a spike in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, which in turn caused a rise in global temperatures. This increase in temperature led to changes in the Earth's ocean chemistry, including a drop in seawater pH and an increase in hydrogen sulphide levels. These changes had a significant impact on marine life, leading to the extinction of some species and the evolution of others.

The Great Oxidation Event, on the other hand, led to a significant increase in the amount of oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere. This increase in oxygen levels was driven by the evolution of photosynthetic bacteria, which began producing oxygen as a byproduct of their metabolism. This increase in oxygen levels had a profound impact on the Earth's biogeochemical cycles, as it allowed for the development of more complex forms of life and the expansion of the oxygenic photosynthesis niche.

The increase in oxygen levels also led to changes in the Earth's ocean chemistry. The increased oxygen levels in the atmosphere led to an increase in the amount of sulphate available for biological sulphate reduction. This increase in sulphate availability led to an increase in hydrogen sulphide production, which in turn increased phosphorus availability in the water column by inhibiting its burial on the seafloor and enabled the development of anoxia.

In conclusion, microorganisms play a crucial role in the biogeochemical cycling of elements and compounds on Earth. Their metabolic activities influence the Earth's climate and ocean chemistry, and their study is essential for understanding the complex dynamics of the Earth's systems.

### Subsection: 1.1d Feedback Mechanisms in Biogeochemical Cycles

Feedback mechanisms play a crucial role in the regulation of biogeochemical cycles. These mechanisms can either amplify or dampen the effects of a change in a system, and they are essential for maintaining stability and balance in complex systems. In the context of the Pre-Cambrian coevolution, understanding these feedback mechanisms is crucial for comprehending the dynamics of the Earth's biogeochemical cycles and their impact on the evolution of life.

#### Positive Feedback Mechanisms

Positive feedback mechanisms amplify the effects of a change in a system. In the context of biogeochemical cycles, positive feedback can lead to a rapid increase or decrease in the concentration of certain elements or compounds. For example, in the carbon cycle, the release of carbon dioxide from volcanic activity can increase the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This increase in carbon dioxide can then lead to a warming of the Earth's surface, which can further increase volcanic activity, creating a positive feedback loop.

#### Negative Feedback Mechanisms

Negative feedback mechanisms, on the other hand, tend to dampen the effects of a change in a system. They work by counteracting the effects of a change, leading to a return to equilibrium. In the context of biogeochemical cycles, negative feedback can help to stabilize the concentration of certain elements or compounds. For example, in the carbon cycle, the absorption of carbon dioxide by plants can help to reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This reduction in carbon dioxide can then lead to a cooling of the Earth's surface, which can decrease volcanic activity, creating a negative feedback loop.

#### Interactions between Feedback Mechanisms

In reality, feedback mechanisms do not operate in isolation. They often interact with each other, creating complex feedback networks. For example, the increase in iron availability during the Selli Event, driven by increased sulphate flux from volcanism, led to an increase in marine productivity. This increase in productivity, in turn, led to an increase in the burial of carbon in sedimentary rocks, which helped to cool the Earth's surface. This negative feedback mechanism helped to counteract the positive feedback mechanism of increased volcanic activity, leading to a return to equilibrium.

Understanding these feedback mechanisms and their interactions is crucial for comprehending the dynamics of the Earth's biogeochemical cycles. It can help us to predict how these cycles will respond to changes in the environment, such as those brought about by human activities. By studying the feedback mechanisms at play during the Pre-Cambrian coevolution, we can gain valuable insights into the complex dynamics of these cycles and their impact on the evolution of life.




### Subsection: 1.1e The Transition to the Phanerozoic Eon

The transition from the Proterozoic Eon to the Phanerozoic Eon, approximately 541 million years ago, marked a significant shift in the Earth's biogeochemical cycles. This transition was characterized by a series of geochemical signals that provide valuable insights into the dynamics of complex systems.

#### The Sturtian and Marinoan Glacial Events

The Sturtian and Marinoan glacial events, which occurred during the Proterozoic Eon, were two of the most significant events that shaped the Earth's biogeochemical cycles. These events were characterized by a rapid drop in seafloor carbonate saturation, indicating a decrease in the concentration of carbonate ions in the ocean. This decrease was likely caused by an increase in the concentration of hydrogen sulphide, which is produced by sulphate-reducing bacteria. The increase in hydrogen sulphide led to a decrease in the pH of the ocean, further exacerbating the drop in carbonate saturation.

The Sturtian event, in particular, was characterized by a drop in seafloor carbonate saturation from 80% to 30%, indicating a significant decrease in the concentration of carbonate ions in the ocean. This event was followed by a gradual recovery, with carbonate saturation reaching 50% by the end of the event. The Marinoan event, on the other hand, was characterized by a more rapid drop in carbonate saturation, from 80% to 20%, followed by a slower recovery.

#### The Recovery from the Marinoan Event

The recovery from the Marinoan event was marked by a gradual increase in carbonate saturation, reaching 50% by the end of the event. This recovery was likely facilitated by an increase in the concentration of iron, which is essential for the growth of photosynthetic organisms. The increase in iron availability led to an increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which in turn led to a warming of the Earth's surface. This warming helped to melt the glaciers, leading to a rise in sea level and a return to normal marine conditions.

#### The Role of Feedback Mechanisms

The recovery from the Marinoan event was also facilitated by a series of feedback mechanisms. The increase in iron availability led to an increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which in turn led to a warming of the Earth's surface. This warming helped to melt the glaciers, leading to a rise in sea level and a return to normal marine conditions. This positive feedback loop helped to stabilize the Earth's biogeochemical cycles and pave the way for the evolution of complex life forms during the Phanerozoic Eon.

In conclusion, the transition to the Phanerozoic Eon was marked by a series of geochemical signals that provide valuable insights into the dynamics of complex systems. The Sturtian and Marinoan glacial events, in particular, played a crucial role in shaping the Earth's biogeochemical cycles and paving the way for the evolution of complex life forms.
