# Multi-material 3D printing

## Workflow

### Designing

Designing a three dimensional object is the first step in the workflow of 3D printing. This design process can be supported by software. Such CAD software is capable of creating, managing and manipulating different 3D geometric figures while giving the user feedback through a graphical interface. Most CAD programs already support the annotation of a geometric figure with a material. The combination of different geometries then forms a single multiple material object. However, not all file formats support the annotation of materials together with the geometry of the object.

### Slicing

Slicing is the process of splitting a 3D model into layers to transform them into a sequence of G-Code instructions. These instructions can be processed by a 3D printer to manufacture the corresponding model in either a bottom-up, top-down or even left to right manner. Before generating the instructions, support structures can be added to connect overhanging sections of the model to either the printing surface or other parts of the model. The support structures have to be removed in a post processing step after the print has finished.

The slicing process for multi-material prints differs depending on the hardware used. For FFF based machines, instructions for changing the material have to be added. This comes with multiple computational challenges such as handling two print heads at the same time without them interfering with each other or clearing the melting chamber from the previous material. For SLA based multi-material prints the slicing software has to handle the additional degrees of freedom arising from the possibility of moving the print from one resin tray to the next one. The slicing procedure for material jetting printers involves the generation of multiple bitmap images representing the voxels of the object.

### Post-Processing

As discussed in the previous chapter, the set-up time of a CNC machine is a critical factor in the overall cost of a part. Therefore, it is essential to consider the set-up time during the design phase. This can be achieved by minimizing the number of operations (flips of the part) required to create the final product. 

For example, if a part requires five operations, each with a set-up time of 1.5 hours, the total set-up time would be 7.5 hours. However, if the part can be designed to require only three operations, the total set-up time would be reduced to 4.5 hours, representing a significant cost savings.

#### 9.1a.2 Design for Machine Time

While the set-up time is a critical factor, the machine time should not be overlooked. The machine time is the time spent actually machining the part. It is important to balance the machine time with the set-up time to ensure the overall cost of the part is minimized. 

For instance, if a part requires five operations, each with a machine time of 15 minutes, the total machine time would be 75 minutes. However, if the part can be designed to require only three operations, the total machine time would be reduced to 45 minutes. 

#### 9.1a.3 Design for Volume

The volume (number of parts to machine) plays a critical role in amortizing the set-up time, programming time, and other activities into the cost of the part. The law of diminishing returns presents itself at a certain point, where the cost per part decreases as the volume increases. Therefore, it is essential to consider the volume when designing for CNC machines.

For example, if a part is designed for a volume of 10, the cost per part could be significantly higher than if the part was designed for a volume of 100. Therefore, it is crucial to consider the volume during the design phase to ensure the cost per part is minimized.

#### 9.1a.4 Design for Sustainability

In addition to the traditional considerations of cost and efficiency, it is also important to consider the environmental impact of the design. This includes the use of materials, the energy consumption of the CNC machine, and the disposal of waste materials. By considering these factors during the design phase, it is possible to create products that are not only efficient and cost-effective but also environmentally friendly.

In conclusion, designing for CNC machines requires a careful consideration of set-up time, machine time, volume, and sustainability. By considering these factors during the design phase, it is possible to create products that are not only efficient and cost-effective but also environmentally friendly.

#### 11.3b Material Selection Process

The process of selecting the right material for a specific application involves understanding the material properties and matching them to the requirements of the application. This process can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Identify the application requirements: The first step in material selection is to clearly define the requirements of the application. This can include mechanical, thermal, electrical, and chemical requirements.

2. Research material properties: Once the application requirements are identified, research can be done to find materials that meet these requirements. This can be done through various sources, including material databases, technical specifications, and industry experts.

3. Compare and evaluate materials: After researching different materials, they can be compared and evaluated based on their properties and cost. This can help in narrowing down the list of potential materials.

4. Select the best material: The final step is to select the best material for the application. This can be based on a combination of factors, including cost, availability, and performance.

#### 11.3c Material Selection Examples

To further illustrate the material selection process, let's consider two examples:

1. Selecting a material for a 3D printed phone case: The application requirements for this case may include durability, flexibility, and aesthetic appeal. Materials such as ABS, PLA, and PETG could be considered, with ABS being the best choice due to its high impact strength and flexibility.

2. Selecting a material for a medical implant: The application requirements for this implant may include biocompatibility, strength, and corrosion resistance. Materials such as titanium, stainless steel, and PLA could be considered, with PLA being the best choice due to its biocompatibility and strength.

In conclusion, understanding material properties and going through a systematic material selection process can help in selecting the right material for a specific application. This can ultimately lead to better performance and reliability of the final product.

<Refimprove|date=January 2011>
A materials database is a database used to store experimental, computational, standards, or design data for materials in such a way that they can be retrieved efficiently by humans or computer programs.

## Background

Fast access and exchange of materials data between research, design and manufacturing teams working on different sites worldwide, is a challenging issue to be addressed during the product cycle in materials engineering. Another important issue is safeguarding high investments made into materials research, meaning that experimental data must be properly conserved, easily be located and quickly be retrieved. Materials databases (MDBs) are powerful tools to address these problems.

The development of factual materials databases began significantly in the 1980s with a leading standardization role being taken by CODATA, ASTM E49 and the British Standards i.e. BSI AMT4/-/6.

## Different types

Various categories of MDBs exist for different requirements, for example containing standards data on metallic alloys and plastics or more complex database applications needed for design analysis. MDBs are basic elements for establishing knowledge-based and expert systems. 

### Web enabled

With the emergence of the Internet, the capability of MDBs increased. Web-enabled MDBs provide a more centralized management and conservation of Materials data. Finding and accessing the required data is faster than to search for them in a traditional manner, e.g. from handbooks or Microsoft Excel files. In particular the dissemination of public research results has improved, as the data are accessible over the World Wide Web. A few web-enabled materials databases exist at present on the market # Material selection

### Section: 18.1 Digital Fabrication in Sculpture:

Sculpture has been a fundamental form of artistic expression for centuries, allowing artists to create three-dimensional works of art that can be viewed from all angles. With the advent of digital fabrication, this traditional art form has been revolutionized, allowing for the creation of intricate and complex sculptures that were previously impossible to achieve with traditional methods.

#### 18.1a 3D Printing in Sculpture

One of the most popular forms of digital fabrication in sculpture is 3D printing. This process involves creating a three-dimensional object by adding layers of material on top of each other. 3D printing has been used in various industries, such as architecture and manufacturing, but it has also gained popularity in the art world.

The process of 3D printing in sculpture begins with the creation of a digital model using computer-aided design (CAD) software. This allows the artist to create a detailed and precise design that can be translated into a physical object. The digital model is then sent to the 3D printer, which uses a variety of materials, such as plastic, metal, or even sand, to create the final sculpture.

One of the most innovative uses of 3D printing in sculpture is the D-Shape printer, developed by MIT graduate Behrokh Khoshnevis. This printer uses a mixture of sand and magnesium oxide (MgO) to create sandstone structures. The process begins with the printer head evenly distributing a layer of sand mixed with MgO. The printer then breaks the digital model into 2-D slices and deposits a binder made up of a solution that includes magnesium chloride. This binder chemically reacts with the sand to form a sandstone material. The process is repeated for each layer, with the printer head moving across the base and depositing the binder.
