### Subsection 1.1a: Introduction to Vector Spaces

In this section, we will introduce the concept of vector spaces, which is a fundamental concept in linear algebra. A vector space is a set of objects, called vectors, that can be added together and multiplied by scalars. This set is equipped with two binary operations, vector addition and scalar multiplication, that satisfy certain axioms. These axioms are listed below:

1. Closure under addition: For any two vectors **x** and **y** in the vector space, their sum **x + y** is also in the vector space.
2. Associativity of addition: For any three vectors **x**, **y**, and **z** in the vector space, the sum (**x + y**) + **z** is equal to **x** + (**y + z**).
3. Commutativity of addition: For any two vectors **x** and **y** in the vector space, **x + y** = **y + x**.
4. Existence of additive identity: There exists an element **0** in the vector space such that for any vector **x**, **x + 0** = **x**.
5. Existence of additive inverse: For any vector **x** in the vector space, there exists an element **-x** such that **x + (-x)** = **0**.
6. Closure under scalar multiplication: For any scalar c and vector **x** in the vector space, their product c**x** is also in the vector space.
7. Distributivity of scalar multiplication over vector addition: For any scalar c and vectors **x** and **y** in the vector space, c(**x + y**) = c**x** + c**y**.
8. Distributivity of scalar multiplication over scalar addition: For any scalars c and d and vector **x** in the vector space, (c + d)**x** = c**x** + d**x**.

These axioms may seem abstract, but they are essential for defining a vector space. They allow us to perform operations on vectors and scalars in a consistent and predictable manner. In the next section, we will explore some examples of vector spaces and see how these axioms are applied.


## Chapter 1: Mathematical Preliminaries:




### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamental concepts of linear algebra and the calculus of variations. These two fields are essential tools in modern mathematics, with applications ranging from engineering to physics. We will begin by discussing the mathematical preliminaries that are necessary for understanding these topics.

Linear algebra is the study of vectors, matrices, and their properties. Vectors are mathematical objects that represent quantities with both magnitude and direction. Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers that can be used to perform operations on vectors. Linear algebra provides a powerful framework for solving systems of equations, performing transformations, and analyzing data.

The calculus of variations is the study of optimization problems. It deals with finding the minimum or maximum values of functions, subject to certain constraints. This field has applications in many areas, including physics, engineering, and economics. The calculus of variations is closely related to differential equations, which are equations that involve derivatives of functions.

In this chapter, we will cover the basic concepts of linear algebra and the calculus of variations. We will also discuss the relationship between these two fields and how they are used in various applications. By the end of this chapter, you will have a solid understanding of the mathematical preliminaries necessary for delving deeper into these topics. So let's begin our journey into the world of linear algebra and the calculus of variations.


## Chapter 1: Mathematical Preliminaries:




### Section 1.1: Vector Space:

In this section, we will introduce the concept of vector spaces, which are fundamental to the study of linear algebra. A vector space is a mathematical structure that allows us to perform operations such as addition and scalar multiplication on vectors. These operations must satisfy certain axioms, which we will discuss in detail.

#### 1.1a: Definition and Properties

A vector space is a set of objects, called vectors, that can be added together and multiplied by scalars. The addition and scalar multiplication operations must satisfy the following axioms:

1. Closure under addition: For any two vectors **x** and **y** in the vector space, the sum **x + y** is also in the vector space.
2. Associativity of addition: For any three vectors **x**, **y**, and **z** in the vector space, the sum (**x + y**) + **z** is equal to **x** + (**y + z**).
3. Commutativity of addition: For any two vectors **x** and **y** in the vector space, **x + y** is equal to **y + x**.
4. Existence of additive identity: There exists an element **0** in the vector space such that for any vector **x**, **x + 0** = **x**.
5. Existence of additive inverse: For any vector **x** in the vector space, there exists an element **-x** such that **x + (-x)** = **0**.
6. Closure under scalar multiplication: For any scalar c and vector **x** in the vector space, the product c**x** is also in the vector space.
7. Distributivity of scalar multiplication over vector addition: For any scalar c and vectors **x** and **y** in the vector space, c(**x + y**) = c**x** + c**y**.
8. Distributivity of scalar multiplication over scalar addition: For any scalars c and d and vector **x** in the vector space, (c + d)**x** = c**x** + d**x**.

These axioms may seem abstract, but they are essential for defining a vector space. They allow us to perform operations on vectors in a consistent and predictable manner.

#### 1.1b: Examples of Vector Spaces

There are many examples of vector spaces in mathematics and other fields. Some common examples include:

- The set of real numbers **R** with the usual addition and multiplication operations.
- The set of n-dimensional vectors **R^n** with component-wise addition and scalar multiplication.
- The set of continuous functions on a closed interval [a, b] with the usual addition and scalar multiplication of functions.
- The set of polynomials of degree n or less with the usual addition and scalar multiplication of polynomials.

These are just a few examples, but there are many more vector spaces that arise in different areas of mathematics.

#### 1.1c: Subspaces and Spanning Sets

In addition to the operations of addition and scalar multiplication, vector spaces also have the concept of subspaces and spanning sets. A subspace is a subset of a vector space that is also a vector space under the induced operations. In other words, if we restrict the operations of addition and scalar multiplication to a subset of a vector space, the resulting set is still a vector space.

Another important concept is the span of a set of vectors. The span of a set **S** is the set of all vectors that can be written as a linear combination of vectors in **S**. In other words, the span of **S** is the smallest subspace containing all the vectors in **S**. This concept is closely related to the concept of a basis, which we will discuss in the next section.

The basis that is dual to <math>\{ e_1 , \ldots , e_n \}</math> is the set of elements of the dual vector space <math>V^{*}</math> that forms a biorthogonal system with this basis, thus being the elements denoted <math>\{ e^1 , \ldots , e^n \}</math> satisfying

A dual basis is also known as a reciprocal basis or reciprocal frame.

A major usage of a dual basis is to separate vectors into components. Given a vector <math>a</math>, scalar components <math>a^i</math> can be defined as
in terms of which <math>a</math> can be separated into vector components as
We can also define scalar components <math>a_i</math> as

3. Commutativity of addition: For any two vectors **x** and **y** in the vector space, **x + y** is equal to **y + x**.
4. Existence of additive identity: There exists an element **0** in the vector space such that for any vector **x**, **x + 0** = **x**.
5. Existence of additive inverse: For any vector **x** in the vector space, there exists an element **-x** such that **x + (-x)** = **0**.
6. Closure under scalar multiplication: For any scalar c and vector **x** in the vector space, the product c**x** is also in the vector space.
7. Distributivity of scalar multiplication over vector addition: For any scalar c and vectors **x** and **y** in the vector space, c(**x + y**) = c**x** + c**y**.
8. Distributivity of scalar multiplication over scalar addition: For any scalars c and d and vector **x** in the vector space, (c + d)**x** = c**x** + d**x**.

These axioms may seem abstract, but they are essential for defining a vector space. They allow us to perform operations on vectors in a consistent and predictable manner.

#### 1.1b: Examples of Vector Spaces

There are many examples of vector spaces in mathematics and other fields. Some common examples include:

- The set of all real numbers **R** is a vector space under the usual addition and multiplication operations.
- The set of all n-dimensional vectors **R^n** is a vector space under component-wise addition and scalar multiplication.
- The set of all continuous functions on a closed interval [a, b] is a vector space under the usual addition and scalar multiplication of functions.
- The set of all n x n matrices is a vector space under matrix addition and scalar multiplication.
- The set of all polynomials of degree less than or equal to n is a vector space under the usual addition and scalar multiplication of polynomials.

These are just a few examples, but there are many more vector spaces in mathematics. In the next section, we will explore some of the important concepts and theorems related to vector spaces.

#### 1.1c: Linear Independence and Basis

In the previous section, we introduced the concept of a vector space and discussed some common examples. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of linear independence and basis, which are fundamental to understanding vector spaces.

##### Linear Independence

A set of vectors **v1, v2, ..., vn** in a vector space **V** is said to be linearly independent if the only solution to the equation **a1v1 + a2v2 + ... + anvn = 0** is **a1 = a2 = ... = an = 0**, where **a1, a2, ..., an** are scalars. In other words, no vector in the set can be expressed as a linear combination of the other vectors.

Linear independence is a crucial concept in vector spaces as it allows us to determine the dimension of a vector space and to construct a basis.

##### Basis

A basis of a vector space **V** is a set of vectors **v1, v2, ..., vn** that is both linearly independent and spans **V**. In other words, the vectors **v1, v2, ..., vn** are linearly independent, and every vector **v** in **V** can be expressed as a linear combination of **v1, v2, ..., vn**.

The concept of a basis is important because it allows us to represent every vector in a vector space as a unique linear combination of the basis vectors. This is particularly useful in applications where we need to solve systems of linear equations.

##### Proof that Every Vector Space has a Basis

The proof that every vector space has a basis is a bit more involved and requires the use of Zorn's lemma, which is equivalent to the axiom of choice. The proof begins by considering the set of all linearly independent subsets of a vector space **V**. Using Zorn's lemma, we can show that this set has a maximal element, which is a linearly independent subset of **V**. We then show that this maximal element is a basis of **V**, thus proving that every vector space has a basis.

##### Dual Basis

The dual basis is a concept that is closely related to the concept of a basis. Given a basis **v1, v2, ..., vn** of a vector space **V**, the dual basis **v1^, v2^, ..., vn^** is a set of vectors in the dual space **V^*** that forms a biorthogonal system with **v1, v2, ..., vn**. In other words, for any scalars **a1, a2, ..., an**, we have **a1v1 + a2v2 + ... + anvn = 0** if and only if **a1v1^ + a2v2^ + ... + anvn^ = 0**.

The dual basis is useful in many applications, particularly in the study of quadratic forms and geometric algebra.

##### Proof that the Dual Basis is a Basis

The proof that the dual basis is a basis is similar to the proof that every vector space has a basis. We start by considering the set of all linearly independent subsets of the dual basis **v1^, v2^, ..., vn^**. Using Zorn's lemma, we can show that this set has a maximal element, which is a linearly independent subset of **V^***. We then show that this maximal element is a basis of **V^*$, thus proving that the dual basis is a basis.

##### Conclusion

In this section, we have explored the concepts of linear independence, basis, and dual basis. These concepts are fundamental to understanding vector spaces and are crucial in many applications of linear algebra. In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of a basis and explore some of its properties.

#### 1.1d: Orthogonality and Inner Products

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of linear independence and basis. In this section, we will delve deeper into the concept of orthogonality and inner products, which are crucial in understanding vector spaces.

##### Orthogonality

Two vectors **v** and **w** in a vector space **V** are said to be orthogonal if their inner product is equal to zero. In other words, **v** and **w** are orthogonal if **v · w = 0**, where **v · w** denotes the inner product of **v** and **w**.

Orthogonality is a fundamental concept in vector spaces as it allows us to define the concept of a perpendicular vector. A vector **v** is perpendicular to a set of vectors **S** if it is orthogonal to every vector in **S**.

##### Inner Products

An inner product on a vector space **V** is a function that takes in two vectors **v** and **w** in **V** and returns a scalar **v · w**. This scalar must satisfy certain properties, which are listed below:

1. Symmetry: **v · w = w · v** for all **v** and **w** in **V**.
2. Positive definiteness: **v · v ≥ 0** for all **v** in **V**, and **v · v = 0** if and only if **v = 0**.
3. Linearity in the first argument: **(av + bw) · x = av · x + bw · x** for all **v**, **w**, and **x** in **V** and scalars **a** and **b**.
4. Linearity in the second argument: **x · (ay + by) = ax · y + bx · z** for all **v**, **w**, and **x** in **V** and scalars **a** and **b**.

The inner product is a crucial concept in vector spaces as it allows us to define the concept of a norm and a distance. The norm of a vector **v** is defined as **||v|| = √v · v**, and the distance between two vectors **v** and **w** is defined as **d(v, w) = ||v - w||**.

##### Proof that Every Vector Space has an Inner Product

The proof that every vector space has an inner product is a bit more involved and requires the use of Zorn's lemma, which is equivalent to the axiom of choice. The proof begins by considering the set of all inner product spaces on **V** that contain a given set of vectors **S**. Using Zorn's lemma, we can show that this set has a maximal element, which is an inner product space on **V** that contains **S**. We then show that this maximal element is an inner product space on **V**, thus proving that every vector space has an inner product.

##### Dual Inner Product

The dual inner product is a concept that is closely related to the concept of a dual basis. Given a basis **v1, v2, ..., vn** of a vector space **V**, the dual inner product is a function that takes in two vectors **v** and **w** in **V** and returns a scalar **v · w**, where **v · w** is defined as **v · w = ∑i=1nvi · wi**, where **vi** and **wi** are the dual vectors of **v** and **w** respectively.

The dual inner product is useful in many applications, particularly in the study of quadratic forms and geometric algebra.

##### Proof that the Dual Inner Product is an Inner Product

The proof that the dual inner product is an inner product is similar to the proof that every vector space has an inner product. We start by considering the set of all dual inner product spaces on **V** that contain a given set of vectors **S**. Using Zorn's lemma, we can show that this set has a maximal element, which is a dual inner product space on **V** that contains **S**. We then show that this maximal element is a dual inner product space on **V$, thus proving that the dual inner product is an inner product.

##### Conclusion

In this section, we have explored the concepts of orthogonality and inner products, which are fundamental to understanding vector spaces. These concepts are crucial in many applications of linear algebra, including the study of quadratic forms and geometric algebra. In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of a basis and explore some of its properties.




### Section: 1.1e Dimension of Vector Space

In the previous section, we discussed the concept of a dual basis and its applications in vector spaces. In this section, we will explore the concept of dimension in vector spaces and its significance.

#### 1.1e.1 Definition of Dimension

The dimension of a vector space is a fundamental concept in linear algebra. It is defined as the maximum number of linearly independent vectors in the space. In other words, it is the number of vectors needed to span the entire space.

#### 1.1e.2 Properties of Dimension

1. The dimension of a vector space is always finite. This is because any vector space has a basis, which is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the space. Since a basis is finite, the dimension of the space is also finite.

2. The dimension of a subspace is always less than or equal to the dimension of the parent space. This is because any subspace is contained within the parent space, and therefore, the number of linearly independent vectors in the subspace is always less than or equal to the number of linearly independent vectors in the parent space.

3. The dimension of a vector space is invariant under isomorphisms. This means that if two vector spaces are isomorphic, i.e., they have a one-to-one correspondence between their elements, then they also have the same dimension.

#### 1.1e.3 Applications of Dimension

The concept of dimension is used in various applications in linear algebra. Some of these applications include:

1. The rank-nullity theorem, which states that the dimension of a vector space is equal to the rank of a linear map plus the nullity of the linear map.

2. The proof of the existence of a basis in a vector space. This proof relies on the fact that the dimension of a vector space is always finite.

3. The proof of the existence of an inverse for a non-singular matrix. This proof relies on the fact that the dimension of the null space of a non-singular matrix is always zero.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of linear independence and its applications in vector spaces.




### Section: 1.1f Components of a Vector

In the previous sections, we have discussed the concept of a vector space and its dimension. Now, we will delve into the concept of components of a vector.

#### 1.1f.1 Definition of Components

The components of a vector are the values that make up the vector. In a vector space, each vector can be represented as a linear combination of the basis vectors. The coefficients of these basis vectors are the components of the vector.

#### 1.1f.2 Properties of Components

1. The number of components of a vector is equal to the dimension of the vector space. This is because each component corresponds to a basis vector, and there are as many basis vectors as the dimension of the space.

2. The components of a vector are unique. This is because the coefficients of the basis vectors in a linear combination are unique. If two vectors have the same components, then they are equal.

3. The components of a vector can be changed by changing the basis. This is because the coefficients of the basis vectors in a linear combination depend on the basis. If we change the basis, the coefficients change, and therefore, the components change.

#### 1.1f.3 Applications of Components

The concept of components is used in various applications in linear algebra. Some of these applications include:

1. The representation of a vector as a linear combination of basis vectors. This is a fundamental concept in linear algebra and is used in many applications, such as solving systems of linear equations and finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices.

2. The calculation of the dot product and cross product of vectors. These operations involve the multiplication of components of the vectors.

3. The calculation of the norm of a vector. The norm of a vector is the square root of the sum of the squares of its components.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of matrices and their properties.
