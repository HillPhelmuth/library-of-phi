## Foreward

Welcome to "Effective Field Theories of QCD: A Comprehensive Guide". This book aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the effective field theories of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), a fundamental theory of particle physics.

The study of effective field theories is crucial in the field of particle physics, particularly in the context of QCD. It allows us to understand the behavior of particles at different energy scales, providing a bridge between the microscopic world of quantum mechanics and the macroscopic world of classical physics.

In this book, we will delve into the intricacies of effective field theories, exploring their mathematical foundations, applications, and limitations. We will begin by introducing the concept of effective field theories, discussing their role in QCD and their relationship with the Standard Model of particle physics.

We will then proceed to discuss the renormalization group procedure for effective particles, a method that allows us to describe bound states of quarks and gluons using QCD. This procedure, also known as the renormalization group procedure for effective particles (RGPEP), is a powerful tool that has been applied to various physical systems using a weak-coupling expansion.

The RGPEP is defined without the need for a perturbative expansion, making it a versatile tool in the study of effective field theories. It introduces effective particles, which can be seen as resulting from a dynamical transformation akin to the Melosh transformation from current to constituent quarks.

### Introduction

Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the fundamental theory of the strong interaction between quarks and gluons. It is a non-abelian gauge theory, meaning that it describes the interactions between particles through the exchange of force-carrying particles, known as gluons. QCD is a cornerstone of modern particle physics, providing the theoretical framework for understanding the behavior of particles at the subatomic level.

In this chapter, we will delve into the world of effective field theories (EFTs) in the context of QCD. EFTs are mathematical tools that allow us to describe the behavior of a system at a certain energy scale, without having to consider the details of the underlying theory at higher scales. This is particularly useful in QCD, where the theory is non-renormalizable and becomes increasingly complex at higher energy scales.

We will begin by discussing the concept of EFTs and their role in QCD. We will then explore the different types of EFTs that have been developed for QCD, including the popular Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET) and the Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET). We will also discuss the applications of these EFTs in various areas of particle physics, such as heavy quark physics, jet physics, and B meson decays.

Throughout this chapter, we will use the popular Markdown format to present the material in a clear and concise manner. This will allow us to easily incorporate mathematical expressions and equations using the TeX and LaTeX style syntax, rendered using the MathJax library. This will help to make the content more accessible and understandable for readers with varying levels of background knowledge in QCD and EFTs.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of effective field theories in the context of QCD, and will be equipped with the knowledge to apply these tools in their own research and studies. So let us begin our journey into the world of effective field theories in QCD.

## Chapter 1: Standard Model Review:

### Introduction

The Standard Model of particle physics is the current theoretical framework that describes the fundamental particles and their interactions. It is a quantum mechanical theory that has been extensively tested and is considered one of the most successful theories in physics. The Standard Model is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, special relativity, and gauge symmetry. It describes the interactions between particles through the exchange of force carriers, known as gauge bosons.

In this chapter, we will provide a comprehensive review of the Standard Model, starting with an overview of its key concepts and principles. We will then delve into the mathematical formalism of the Standard Model, including the Lagrangian and the equations of motion. We will also discuss the particle content of the Standard Model, including the quarks, leptons, and gauge bosons.

Next, we will explore the symmetries of the Standard Model, including the gauge symmetries and the global symmetries. We will also discuss the concept of renormalization and how it is used to handle the divergences that arise in quantum field theory.

Finally, we will touch upon some of the key experimental results that have been used to test the Standard Model, including the discovery of the Higgs boson and the precise measurements of the fundamental constants. We will also discuss some of the open questions and challenges in the Standard Model, such as the origin of dark matter and the hierarchy problem.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of the Standard Model and its key concepts, principles, and symmetries. This will serve as a foundation for the rest of the book, where we will explore the effective field theories of QCD and their applications in particle physics.




### Section 1.1 CKM Matrix:

The Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix is a fundamental component of the Standard Model of particle physics. It describes the interactions between quarks of different generations, and is named after the physicists who first proposed it. The CKM matrix is a key tool in understanding the structure of the Standard Model and has been extensively studied and tested.

#### 1.1a Introduction to CKM Matrix

The CKM matrix is a 3x3 matrix that relates the quark fields of different generations. It is defined as the product of three matrices:

$$
V_{CKM} = V_L V_R^\dagger
$$

where $V_L$ and $V_R$ are the left and right-handed quark mixing matrices, respectively. These matrices are defined as:

$$
V_L = \begin{pmatrix}
V_{ud} & V_{us} & V_{ub} \\
V_{cd} & V_{cs} & V_{cb} \\
V_{td} & V_{ts} & V_{tb}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

$$
V_R = \begin{pmatrix}
V_{11} & V_{12} & V_{13} \\
V_{21} & V_{22} & V_{23} \\
V_{31} & V_{32} & V_{33}
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The CKM matrix is unitary, meaning that its inverse is equal to its transpose:

$$
V_{CKM}^\dagger V_{CKM} = V_{CKM} V_{CKM}^\dagger = I
$$

This property is crucial for the conservation of probability in the Standard Model.

The CKM matrix is also responsible for the phenomenon of quark flavor change, where a quark of one generation can transform into a quark of another generation. This is possible due to the non-diagonal elements of the CKM matrix, which allow for mixing between different generations.

#### 1.1b Parameterizations of the CKM Matrix

There are several different parameterizations of the CKM matrix, each with its own advantages and applications. The most commonly used parameterizations are the KM parameters, the "standard" parameters, and the Wolfenstein parameters.

The KM parameters, proposed by Kobayashi and Maskawa, use three angles and a CP-violating phase angle to define the CKM matrix. The angles are denoted as $\theta_1$, $\theta_2$, and $\theta_3$, and the CP-violating phase is denoted as $\delta$. The cosines and sines of these angles are denoted as $c_k$ and $s_k$, respectively, where $k$ represents the generation number.

The "standard" parameters, as the name suggests, are a more standardized parameterization of the CKM matrix. It uses three Euler angles and one CP-violating phase to define the matrix. The angles are denoted as $\theta_{12}$, $\theta_{23}$, and $\theta_{13}$, and the CP-violating phase is denoted as $\delta_{13}$. The cosines and sines of these angles are denoted as $c_{jk}$ and $s_{jk}$, respectively, where $j$ and $k$ represent the generation numbers.

The Wolfenstein parameters, proposed by Lincoln Wolfenstein, use four parameters to define the CKM matrix: $\lambda$, $A$, $\rho$, and $\eta$. These parameters are related to the "standard" parameterization, with the property that all are of order 1. The approximation to order $\lambda^3$, good to better than 0.3% accuracy, is:

$$
V_{CKM} \approx \begin{pmatrix}
1-\frac{1}{2}\lambda^2 & \lambda & A\lambda^3(\rho-i\eta) \\
-\lambda & 1-\frac{1}{2}\lambda^2 & A\lambda^2 \\
A\lambda^3(1-\rho-i\eta) & A\lambda^2 & 1
\end{pmatrix}
$$

Rates of CP violation correspond to the parameters $\rho$ and $\eta$.

Using the values of the CKM matrix as of 2008, the best determination of the Wolfenstein parameter values is:

$$
\lambda = 0.2257 \pm 0.0003
$$

$$
A = 0.813 \pm 0.020
$$

$$
\rho = 0.150 \pm 0.015
$$

$$
\eta = 0.345 \pm 0.012
$$

In the next section, we will explore the implications of these parameterizations and their applications in the Standard Model.





### Section 1.1b Unitarity Triangle

The unitarity of the CKM matrix is a fundamental concept in the Standard Model of particle physics. It is a direct consequence of the conservation of probability and ensures that the total probability of a quark transitioning from one generation to another is conserved. This property is crucial for the stability of the Standard Model and has been extensively tested and confirmed by experimental data.

The unitarity of the CKM matrix can be expressed as:

$$
V_{CKM}^\dagger V_{CKM} = I
$$

This equation can be rewritten in terms of the individual elements of the CKM matrix, resulting in a set of constraints on the parameters of the CKM matrix. These constraints can be visualized as a set of triangles in the complex plane, known as the unitarity triangles.

The unitarity triangles are a powerful tool for understanding the structure of the CKM matrix. They provide a visual representation of the constraints on the CKM matrix and can be used to test the predictions of the Standard Model. The area of the unitarity triangles is related to the CP-violating phase of the CKM matrix, and the shape of the triangles can provide insights into the structure of the CKM matrix.

The unitarity triangles can be calculated using the CKM matrix elements, which are determined from experimental data. The most precise measurements of the CKM matrix elements come from the Belle and BaBar experiments, which have measured the CKM matrix elements with a precision of a few percent. These measurements have been used to construct the unitarity triangles, which have been found to be consistent with the predictions of the Standard Model.

The unitarity triangles have also been used to test the predictions of new physics models, such as supersymmetry and extra dimensions. These models can modify the structure of the CKM matrix and alter the shape of the unitarity triangles. By comparing the predictions of these models with the experimental data, physicists can test the validity of these models and search for new physics beyond the Standard Model.

In conclusion, the unitarity triangles are a crucial tool for understanding the structure of the CKM matrix and testing the predictions of the Standard Model. They provide a visual representation of the constraints on the CKM matrix and have been extensively studied and tested. The ongoing experiments at the Belle, BaBar, and LHCb experiments will continue to provide more precise measurements of the CKM matrix elements, allowing for a deeper understanding of the unitarity triangles and the structure of the CKM matrix.





### Subsection 1.1c CP Violation

CP violation, or the violation of the combined symmetry of charge conjugation (C) and parity (P), is a fundamental concept in particle physics. It is a key prediction of the Standard Model and has been extensively studied and tested. The discovery of CP violation was a major breakthrough in the field of particle physics, as it provided evidence for the existence of new physics beyond the Standard Model.

The most well-known example of CP violation is the decay of the K meson. The K meson is a particle that can decay into two pions, and the decay process can be described by the CKM matrix. The decay process can be written as:

$$
K^0 \rightarrow \pi^+ + \pi^-
$$

This decay process is governed by the CKM matrix, and the probability of this decay process is given by:

$$
P(K^0 \rightarrow \pi^+ + \pi^-) = |V_{ud}|^2 |V_{us}|^2
$$

where $V_{ud}$ and $V_{us}$ are the elements of the CKM matrix. The CP conjugate process is given by:

$$
\bar{K}^0 \rightarrow \pi^- + \pi^+
$$

The probability of this decay process is given by:

$$
P(\bar{K}^0 \rightarrow \pi^- + \pi^+) = |V_{ud}|^2 |V_{us}|^2
$$

If there is no CP violation, then the probabilities of these two processes should be equal. However, experimental data has shown that these probabilities are not equal, indicating the presence of CP violation.

The CP violation in the decay of the K meson can be visualized using the unitarity triangles. The area of the unitarity triangles is related to the CP-violating phase of the CKM matrix, and the shape of the triangles can provide insights into the structure of the CKM matrix. The unitarity triangles have been used to test the predictions of the Standard Model and to search for new physics beyond the Standard Model.

In addition to the decay of the K meson, CP violation has also been observed in other processes, such as the decay of the B meson. The study of CP violation is an active area of research in particle physics, and ongoing experiments are searching for new sources of CP violation and testing the predictions of the Standard Model.




### Subsection 1.2a Introduction to the Standard Model

The Standard Model of particle physics is a quantum field theory that describes three of the four known fundamental forces (electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions – excluding gravity) in the universe and classifies all known elementary particles. It was developed in stages throughout the latter half of the 20th century, through the work of many scientists worldwide, with the current formulation being finalized in the mid-1970s upon experimental confirmation of the existence of quarks. Since then, proof of the top quark (1995), the tau neutrino (2000), and the Higgs boson (2012) have added further credence to the Standard Model. In addition, the Standard Model has predicted various properties of weak neutral currents and the W and Z bosons with great accuracy.

Although the Standard Model is believed to be theoretically self-consistent and has demonstrated success in providing experimental predictions, it leaves some physical phenomena unexplained and so falls short of being a complete theory of fundamental interactions. For example, it does not fully explain baryon asymmetry, incorporate the full theory of gravitation as described by general relativity, or account for the universe's accelerating expansion as possibly described by dark energy. The model does not contain any viable dark matter particle that possesses all of the required properties deduced from observational cosmology. It also does not incorporate neutrino oscillations and their non-zero masses. Accordingly, it is used as a basis for building more exotic models that incorporate hypothetical particles, extra dimensions, and elaborate symmetries (such as supersymmetry) to explain experimental results at variance with the Standard Model, such as the existence of dark matter and neutrino oscillations.

The Standard Model is organized into two main categories: fermions, which are the matter particles, and bosons, which are the force-carrying particles. Fermions are further divided into quarks and leptons, while bosons include the photon (carrier of the electromagnetic force), the W and Z bosons (carriers of the weak force), and the gluons (carriers of the strong force). The Higgs boson is a special case, as it is associated with the Higgs field, which gives particles their mass.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the Standard Model, exploring its fundamental principles, mathematical formulation, and the experimental evidence that supports it. We will also discuss the role of the Standard Model in the broader context of particle physics and cosmology, and its implications for our understanding of the universe.

### Subsection 1.2b The Standard Model as an EFT

The Standard Model of particle physics, despite its successes, is not a complete theory. It does not account for certain phenomena such as baryon asymmetry, dark matter, and the accelerated expansion of the universe. However, it is still a powerful tool for understanding the fundamental interactions of particles. One of the ways in which the Standard Model is used is as an effective field theory (EFT).

An effective field theory is a theoretical framework that describes the behavior of a system at a certain energy scale. It is a low-energy approximation of a more fundamental theory. In the case of the Standard Model, the fundamental theory is unknown, and the Standard Model is used as an EFT to describe the behavior of particles at low energies.

The Standard Model as an EFT is particularly useful in the study of particle physics. It allows us to make predictions about the behavior of particles at low energies, where the effects of higher-energy phenomena are negligible. This is because the Standard Model is a renormalizable theory, meaning that it can be used to make predictions at any energy scale without encountering infinities.

The Standard Model as an EFT is also useful in the study of particle physics because it allows us to incorporate new physics. If we discover a new particle or interaction that is not described by the Standard Model, we can simply add it to the theory as an additional term. This allows us to continue using the Standard Model as a framework for understanding particle physics, even as we discover new phenomena.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of effective field theories and explore how they are used in particle physics. We will also discuss the limitations of the Standard Model as an EFT and the ongoing efforts to develop more complete theories of particle physics.

### Subsection 1.2c Applications of the Standard Model

The Standard Model of particle physics, despite its limitations, has been instrumental in the study of particle physics. It has been used to make predictions about the behavior of particles at low energies, where the effects of higher-energy phenomena are negligible. This has been particularly useful in the study of particle physics, as it allows us to make predictions about the behavior of particles at low energies without encountering infinities.

One of the most significant applications of the Standard Model is in the study of the Higgs boson. The Higgs boson is a fundamental particle that is responsible for giving other particles their mass. The Standard Model predicts the existence of the Higgs boson, and its discovery in 2012 at the Large Hadron Collider was a major milestone in particle physics. The Standard Model has been used to make predictions about the properties of the Higgs boson, which have been confirmed by experimental data.

The Standard Model has also been used in the study of the electroweak interaction. The electroweak interaction is one of the four fundamental interactions in nature, and it is responsible for the interaction between particles of different spin. The Standard Model predicts the existence of the W and Z bosons, which are responsible for mediating the electroweak interaction. The discovery of these bosons in the 1980s provided strong evidence for the existence of the electroweak interaction and the validity of the Standard Model.

In addition to its applications in the study of specific particles and interactions, the Standard Model has also been used in the development of effective field theories (EFTs). EFTs are theoretical frameworks that describe the behavior of a system at a certain energy scale. The Standard Model is used as an EFT to describe the behavior of particles at low energies, where the effects of higher-energy phenomena are negligible. This allows us to make predictions about the behavior of particles at low energies without encountering infinities.

In conclusion, the Standard Model of particle physics, despite its limitations, has been instrumental in the study of particle physics. It has been used to make predictions about the behavior of particles at low energies, to study specific particles and interactions, and to develop effective field theories. Despite its limitations, the Standard Model remains a powerful tool in the study of particle physics.

### Subsection 1.3a Introduction to Effective Field Theories

Effective Field Theories (EFTs) are a powerful tool in the study of quantum field theories, particularly in the context of quantum mechanics. They allow us to describe the behavior of a system at a certain energy scale, where the effects of higher-energy phenomena are negligible. This is particularly useful in particle physics, where we often deal with particles at low energies.

The concept of EFTs is rooted in the idea of renormalization, a process that allows us to make predictions about the behavior of a system at any energy scale without encountering infinities. In the context of quantum mechanics, renormalization is achieved by introducing a cutoff, a maximum energy scale at which the theory is valid. Above this cutoff, the theory is considered to be non-perturbative, and its behavior is described by a more fundamental theory.

EFTs are particularly useful in the study of quantum field theories, where the behavior of the system can be described by a set of fields and their interactions. The EFT is constructed by including only those terms in the Lagrangian that are relevant at the energy scale of interest. This is achieved by systematically expanding the Lagrangian in terms of the cutoff, with higher-order terms being suppressed by powers of the cutoff.

The Standard Model of particle physics, despite its limitations, is often used as an EFT. This is because it is a renormalizable theory, meaning that it can be used to make predictions at any energy scale without encountering infinities. The Standard Model is used as an EFT to describe the behavior of particles at low energies, where the effects of higher-energy phenomena are negligible. This allows us to make predictions about the behavior of particles at low energies without encountering infinities.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the concept of EFTs, exploring their mathematical foundations and their applications in particle physics. We will also discuss the limitations of EFTs and the ongoing efforts to develop more complete theories of particle physics.

### Subsection 1.3b Construction of Effective Field Theories

The construction of Effective Field Theories (EFTs) involves a systematic expansion of the Lagrangian in terms of the cutoff, with higher-order terms being suppressed by powers of the cutoff. This is achieved by including only those terms in the Lagrangian that are relevant at the energy scale of interest. 

The EFT is constructed by introducing a set of fields and their interactions. The Lagrangian of the EFT is given by:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_0 + \mathcal{L}_1 + \mathcal{L}_2 + \cdots
$$

where $\mathcal{L}_0$ is the leading-order Lagrangian, $\mathcal{L}_1$ is the next-to-leading-order Lagrangian, and so on. The terms in $\mathcal{L}_n$ are suppressed by a factor of $1/\Lambda^n$, where $\Lambda$ is the cutoff.

The leading-order Lagrangian, $\mathcal{L}_0$, describes the behavior of the system at the energy scale of interest. It includes only those terms that are relevant at this scale. The next-to-leading-order Lagrangian, $\mathcal{L}_1$, includes terms that are relevant at higher energy scales, but are suppressed by a factor of $1/\Lambda$. These terms are often referred to as "corrections" to the leading-order Lagrangian.

The construction of the EFT is a recursive process. Once the leading-order Lagrangian is known, the next-to-leading-order Lagrangian can be constructed by including all terms that are relevant at higher energy scales and are suppressed by a factor of $1/\Lambda$. This process can be repeated to construct higher-order Lagrangians.

The construction of the EFT is a powerful tool in the study of quantum field theories. It allows us to describe the behavior of a system at a certain energy scale, where the effects of higher-energy phenomena are negligible. This is particularly useful in particle physics, where we often deal with particles at low energies.

In the next section, we will discuss the applications of EFTs in particle physics, focusing on their use in the study of the Standard Model.

### Subsection 1.3c Applications of Effective Field Theories

In addition to its applications in particle physics, EFTs have also been used in the study of condensed matter physics, where they have been instrumental in the development of the Landau theory of phase transitions. This theory describes the behavior of a system near a critical point, where the effects of higher-energy phenomena are negligible.

In conclusion, Effective Field Theories are a powerful tool in the study of quantum field theories. They allow us to describe the behavior of a system at a certain energy scale, where the effects of higher-energy phenomena are negligible. This is particularly useful in particle physics, where we often deal with particles at low energies. The Standard Model, which is an EFT, has been instrumental in the development of particle physics, and its applications continue to be a subject of ongoing research.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the Standard Model of particle physics, a theoretical framework that describes three of the four fundamental forces in the universe and classifies all known elementary particles. We have delved into the mathematical underpinnings of the model, including the use of vector spaces and group theory to represent particles and their interactions. We have also examined the role of symmetry in the model, and how it leads to the conservation of certain physical quantities.

The Standard Model is a powerful tool for understanding the fundamental building blocks of matter and their interactions. However, it is not a complete theory, and there are many unanswered questions and mysteries in particle physics. The search for a more comprehensive theory, one that can account for the remaining fundamental force (gravity) and explain phenomena such as dark matter and the Higgs boson, continues to be a major focus of research in particle physics.

In the next chapter, we will begin our exploration of Effective Field Theories, a set of mathematical tools that allow us to describe complex physical systems in a simplified manner. We will see how these theories can be used to describe the behavior of particles at different energy scales, and how they can be used to make predictions about the behavior of particles at low energies.

## Chapter: Quantum Mechanics of Systems with Spin

### Introduction

In the realm of quantum physics, the concept of spin is a fundamental and intriguing one. It is a property of particles that is not easily grasped by our everyday intuition, yet it plays a crucial role in the quantum world. This chapter, "Quantum Mechanics of Systems with Spin," delves into the fascinating world of quantum spin, exploring its implications and applications in quantum physics.

Spin is a quantum mechanical property of particles that is analogous, but not identical, to the concept of spin in classical physics. It is a purely quantum mechanical phenomenon, and its understanding requires a departure from classical intuition. The quantum spin of a particle is a quantum mechanical property that is intrinsically associated with the particle. It is a fundamental property of particles, much like mass or charge.

In this chapter, we will explore the mathematical formalism of quantum spin, including the Stern-Gerlach experiment, which provides a direct measurement of spin. We will also delve into the concept of spinors, mathematical entities that describe particles with spin. The chapter will also touch upon the role of spin in quantum statistics, leading to the classification of particles into fermions and bosons.

Furthermore, we will explore the concept of spin in the context of quantum mechanics, including the spinor representation of the rotation group. This will involve the use of Dirac notation, a standard notation in quantum mechanics, and the use of the Clifford algebra $Cℓ_{3,0}(\Reals)$, which is used to describe spinors.

Finally, we will touch upon the concept of spin in the context of quantum field theory, including the Dirac equation, which describes particles with spin 1/2. This will involve the use of the Dirac gamma matrices, which are used to describe spinors in three dimensions.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the quantum mechanics of systems with spin, equipping readers with the necessary tools to understand and apply these concepts in their own research. It is our hope that this chapter will serve as a valuable resource for those interested in the fascinating world of quantum physics.
