### Subsection 1.1a Causes of Urban Neighborhood Decline

Urban neighborhood decline is a complex issue that has been studied extensively by urban planners and sociologists. It is a multifaceted problem that can be attributed to a variety of factors, including economic, social, and political forces. In this section, we will explore some of the key causes of urban neighborhood decline, with a focus on the two neighborhoods of Mission Hill and Egleston Square in Boston.

#### Economic Factors

One of the primary causes of urban neighborhood decline is economic. As cities grow and evolve, certain neighborhoods may become less economically viable due to changes in industry, technology, and consumer preferences. This can lead to a decline in property values, decreased investment, and a loss of jobs and businesses. In Mission Hill and Egleston Square, for example, the decline of the manufacturing industry and the rise of e-commerce have contributed to a decrease in economic activity in these neighborhoods.

#### Social Factors

Social factors also play a significant role in urban neighborhood decline. As neighborhoods decline, they may become less attractive to residents, leading to a decrease in population. This can result in a loss of community cohesion and a sense of abandonment. In addition, as neighborhoods become less diverse and inclusive, they may become less desirable to certain groups, leading to further decline. In Mission Hill and Egleston Square, the loss of affordable housing options and the lack of diversity have contributed to a decline in population and a sense of abandonment in these neighborhoods.

#### Political Factors

Political factors can also contribute to urban neighborhood decline. As neighborhoods decline, they may become less politically influential, leading to a lack of investment and support from local and federal governments. In addition, changes in government policies and regulations can also have a significant impact on neighborhoods. For example, the implementation of urban renewal policies in the 1960s and 1970s led to the displacement of many low-income residents in cities like Boston, contributing to the decline of certain neighborhoods.

#### The Role of Urban Renewal

Urban renewal, while well-intentioned, has been a major contributor to urban neighborhood decline. The implementation of urban renewal policies in the mid-20th century led to the displacement of many low-income residents, as well as the destruction of historic buildings and neighborhoods. This not only resulted in a loss of community and cultural heritage, but also contributed to the economic decline of these neighborhoods. In Mission Hill and Egleston Square, urban renewal policies have led to the loss of affordable housing options and a decrease in diversity, further contributing to their decline.

In conclusion, urban neighborhood decline is a complex issue with multiple causes. Economic, social, and political factors all play a role in the decline of neighborhoods, and it is important to address these factors in order to revitalize and improve these areas. In the next section, we will explore some strategies for revitalizing urban main streets, with a focus on Mission Hill and Egleston Square.





### Subsection 1.1b Consequences of Urban Neighborhood Decline

The consequences of urban neighborhood decline are far-reaching and can have a significant impact on the surrounding community. In this subsection, we will explore some of the key consequences of urban neighborhood decline, with a focus on the two neighborhoods of Mission Hill and Egleston Square in Boston.

#### Economic Consequences

The economic consequences of urban neighborhood decline can be devastating. As property values decrease, so does the tax base for the neighborhood. This can lead to a decrease in funding for public services, such as schools, parks, and public safety. In addition, the loss of jobs and businesses can also have a ripple effect on the local economy, leading to further decline. In Mission Hill and Egleston Square, the decline of the manufacturing industry and the rise of e-commerce have resulted in a loss of jobs and businesses, leading to a decrease in the local economy.

#### Social Consequences

The social consequences of urban neighborhood decline can also be significant. As neighborhoods decline, they may become less safe and more prone to crime. This can lead to a decrease in quality of life for residents and can also have a negative impact on property values. In addition, the loss of community cohesion and sense of abandonment can also have a detrimental effect on the well-being of residents. In Mission Hill and Egleston Square, the loss of affordable housing options and the lack of diversity have contributed to a sense of abandonment and decreased community cohesion.

#### Environmental Consequences

Urban neighborhood decline can also have environmental consequences. As neighborhoods decline, they may become more prone to blight and neglect. This can lead to an increase in abandoned buildings and vacant lots, which can have a negative impact on the surrounding environment. In addition, the loss of green spaces and public parks can also have a detrimental effect on the environment and the health of residents. In Mission Hill and Egleston Square, the decline of the manufacturing industry has resulted in the abandonment of industrial sites, leading to environmental contamination and blight.

#### Political Consequences

The political consequences of urban neighborhood decline can also be significant. As neighborhoods decline, they may become less politically influential, leading to a lack of investment and support from local and federal governments. This can further exacerbate the decline of the neighborhood and create a cycle of neglect. In addition, changes in government policies and regulations can also have a significant impact on urban neighborhoods, as seen in the case of the Urban Renewal policies of the 1960s and 1970s, which led to the displacement of low-income residents and the destruction of historic neighborhoods.

In conclusion, the consequences of urban neighborhood decline are far-reaching and can have a significant impact on the surrounding community. It is important for urban planners and policymakers to address the causes of decline and implement strategies to revitalize these neighborhoods in order to improve the quality of life for residents and create more vibrant and sustainable communities.

The social challenges in urban neighborhood revitalization are also significant. The loss of community cohesion and sense of abandonment have been major issues in Mission Hill and Egleston Square. This has led to a decrease in community engagement and participation, making it difficult to mobilize residents for revitalization efforts. In addition, the high levels of crime and safety concerns have also been a challenge in these neighborhoods.

#### Environmental Challenges

The environmental challenges in urban neighborhood revitalization are often overlooked, but they are just as important as the economic and social challenges. The high levels of pollution and blight have been major issues in Mission Hill and Egleston Square. This has led to a decline in the quality of life for residents and has also made it difficult to attract new residents and businesses. In addition, the lack of green spaces and public parks has also been a challenge in these neighborhoods.

#### Institutional Challenges

The institutional challenges in urban neighborhood revitalization are also significant. The lack of coordination and communication between different stakeholders, such as government agencies, community organizations, and private developers, has been a major challenge in Mission Hill and Egleston Square. This has led to a lack of cohesive and comprehensive revitalization plans, making it difficult to address all the challenges faced by these neighborhoods.

In conclusion, urban neighborhood revitalization is a complex and multifaceted process that requires addressing a variety of challenges. The neighborhoods of Mission Hill and Egleston Square in Boston have faced a decline in recent years, and it is crucial to address these challenges in order to revitalize these neighborhoods and improve the quality of life for their residents. In the following sections, we will explore some strategies and initiatives that can be implemented to address these challenges and revitalize these neighborhoods.





### Subsection 1.2a Overview of Main Street Sites

These sites are characterized by a mix of residential, commercial, and institutional land uses, and are home to a diverse population of residents.

#### Mission Hill Main Street Site

The main street site in Mission Hill is located along Tremont Street, which runs through the center of the neighborhood. This site is home to a variety of businesses, including restaurants, retail stores, and service providers. The site also includes several institutional buildings, such as the Mission Hill Branch Library and the Mission Hill Health Movement.

The main street site in Mission Hill has a rich history, with many of the buildings dating back to the 19th and early 20th centuries. However, the site has also experienced significant changes in recent years, with the development of new housing and commercial spaces.

#### Egleston Square Main Street Site

The main street site in Egleston Square is located along Washington Street, which runs through the center of the neighborhood. This site is also home to a mix of residential, commercial, and institutional land uses. The site includes several businesses, such as restaurants, retail stores, and service providers, as well as institutional buildings like the Egleston Square Branch Library and the Egleston Square YMCA.

Similar to Mission Hill, the main street site in Egleston Square has a strong sense of community and is home to a diverse population. The site has also undergone significant changes in recent years, with the development of new housing and commercial spaces.

#### Challenges and Opportunities

### Subsection 1.2b Identifying Main Street Issues

The main street sites in Mission Hill and Egleston Square, like many urban areas, face a variety of challenges that must be addressed in order to revitalize these neighborhoods. These challenges can be broadly categorized into economic, social, and environmental issues.

#### Economic Issues

Both main street sites have experienced economic decline in recent years. This is evident in the high vacancy rates of commercial spaces and the closure of businesses. The economic decline is also reflected in the high poverty rates of these neighborhoods. In Mission Hill, 28% of residents live below the poverty line, while in Egleston Square, the poverty rate is even higher at 32%. This economic decline has a ripple effect on the entire community, leading to social and environmental issues as well.

#### Social Issues

The main street sites in Mission Hill and Egleston Square also face significant social issues. These include high crime rates, drug use, and a lack of community cohesion. The high crime rates in these neighborhoods are a major concern for residents and have contributed to a sense of insecurity and fear. Drug use is also a prevalent issue, particularly among the youth population. This not only has negative impacts on the individuals involved, but also on the overall community.

#### Environmental Issues

The main street sites in Mission Hill and Egleston Square are also facing environmental challenges. These include air and water pollution, as well as a lack of green spaces and access to healthy food options. The high levels of air and water pollution are due to the proximity of these neighborhoods to major highways and industrial areas. This pollution not only has negative impacts on the environment, but also on the health of residents. Additionally, the lack of green spaces and healthy food options contributes to the overall health and well-being of residents.

#### Opportunities for Revitalization

Despite these challenges, there are also opportunities for revitalization in these main street sites. The economic decline has created opportunities for redevelopment and the creation of new businesses. The high poverty rates have also led to the development of various social programs and initiatives aimed at improving the lives of residents. Additionally, the environmental challenges have sparked community efforts to improve air and water quality, as well as to create more green spaces and access to healthy food options.

In the next section, we will explore strategies for addressing these main street issues and revitalizing these neighborhoods.





### Subsection 1.2c Strategies for Addressing Main Street Issues

In order to revitalize the main street sites in Mission Hill and Egleston Square, it is crucial to address the economic, social, and environmental issues that are currently facing these neighborhoods. This can be achieved through a combination of strategies that aim to improve the economic, social, and environmental conditions of these areas.

#### Economic Strategies

To address the economic decline in these neighborhoods, it is important to focus on attracting new businesses and creating job opportunities. This can be achieved through targeted marketing and promotions to attract businesses, as well as providing incentives for entrepreneurs to start new businesses. Additionally, creating job training programs for residents can help to improve their employability and attract new businesses to the area.

#### Social Strategies

Addressing the social issues in these neighborhoods requires a multi-faceted approach. This includes implementing community policing programs to address crime and drug use, as well as providing resources for mental health and substance abuse treatment. Additionally, community building initiatives can help to foster a sense of community cohesion and pride.

In the previous chapter, we discussed the importance of revitalizing urban main streets and the challenges faced by the communities of Mission Hill and Egleston Square. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the strategies that can be employed to revitalize these main streets. These strategies are not only applicable to these two communities but can also serve as a guide for other urban areas facing similar challenges.

The strategies for revitalization are numerous and varied, and they are often interconnected. They range from physical improvements to the streetscape, to economic development initiatives, to community engagement and social programs. Each of these strategies has its own set of benefits and challenges, and they must be carefully considered and implemented in a way that is tailored to the specific needs and characteristics of each community.

In this chapter, we will explore these strategies in detail, discussing their potential benefits, challenges, and how they can be implemented in a way that is effective and sustainable.

#### 2.1a Identifying Project Goals

The first step in any revitalization project is to clearly define the project goals. These goals should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). They should also align with the overall mission of the project, which in this case is to revitalize the urban main streets of Mission Hill and Egleston Square.

The project goals for the revitalization of Mission Hill and Egleston Square could include:

1. Improving the economic vitality of the area by attracting new businesses and creating job opportunities.
2. Enhancing the physical appearance of the streets and public spaces to create a more attractive and livable community.
3. Promoting social cohesion and community engagement by involving local residents and businesses in the revitalization process.
4. Increasing the walkability and accessibility of the streets to improve the quality of life for residents and visitors.
5. Preserving the cultural heritage and identity of the community while promoting modernization and progress.

These goals are all interconnected and contribute to the overall goal of revitalizing the urban main streets. They provide a clear direction for the project and serve as a guide for decision-making and resource allocation.

The Goals Breakdown Structure (GBS) is a useful tool for organizing and managing these goals. The GBS follows two rules for decomposition: the first rule ensures the success of the layer above, and the second rule prevents the project from exhibiting extra scope and work that doesn't add value to the organization. This ensures that the project goals are aligned with the overall mission and that resources are allocated efficiently.

The structure of the GBS typically contains four layers or tiers. The first tier is the project goal or mission statement, which provides the overall direction for the project. The second tier contains the business objectives, which are the expected outcomes from the project. The third tier contains the project requirements, which are the specific characteristics and features required to achieve the business objectives. The fourth tier, if applicable, contains product specifications, which are the detailed characteristics and features of the project deliverables.

By breaking down the project goals into these layers, the project team can ensure that all aspects of the project are aligned and contribute to the overall goal of revitalizing the urban main streets. This also allows for better communication and collaboration among team members, as each layer has a specific focus and responsibility.

In the next section, we will discuss the strategies for achieving these project goals and how they can be implemented in a way that is tailored to the specific needs and characteristics of the Mission Hill and Egleston Square communities.

#### 2.1b Engaging Community Stakeholders

Engaging community stakeholders is a crucial aspect of the revitalization process. Stakeholders include local residents, businesses, community organizations, and government agencies. Their involvement is essential for the success of the project as they can provide valuable insights, support, and resources.

There are several strategies for engaging community stakeholders:

1. **Communication and Transparency**: Keep stakeholders informed about the project's progress, goals, and decisions. This can be achieved through regular meetings, newsletters, and social media. Transparency builds trust and encourages stakeholder participation.

2. **Collaboration and Partnership**: Collaborate with stakeholders to develop solutions that meet their needs and contribute to the project's goals. This can be achieved through joint planning, decision-making, and implementation. Partnerships can also provide access to additional resources and expertise.

3. **Inclusion and Diversity**: Ensure that all stakeholders have an opportunity to participate in the project. This includes reaching out to underrepresented groups and providing opportunities for their input. Inclusion fosters a sense of ownership and commitment among stakeholders.

4. **Capacity Building**: Provide training and support to stakeholders to enhance their ability to contribute to the project. This can include skills development, resource allocation, and problem-solving. Capacity building empowers stakeholders and increases their ability to participate effectively.

5. **Feedback and Evaluation**: Seek feedback from stakeholders throughout the project and use it to improve project processes and outcomes. This can be achieved through surveys, focus groups, and evaluations. Feedback and evaluation help to ensure that the project is meeting stakeholder needs and expectations.

Engaging community stakeholders is not a one-time event but an ongoing process that requires continuous effort and adaptation. It is a key component of the revitalization strategy and can significantly enhance the project's success.

#### 2.1c Implementing Revitalization Strategies

Implementing revitalization strategies is a critical step in the process of revitalizing urban main streets. This process involves translating the identified goals and objectives into actionable plans and initiatives. It also involves mobilizing resources and engaging stakeholders to ensure the successful implementation of these strategies.

There are several key steps in implementing revitalization strategies:

1. **Developing an Implementation Plan**: The first step in implementing revitalization strategies is to develop a detailed implementation plan. This plan should outline the specific actions that will be taken to achieve the project goals, the resources required, and the timeline for implementation. It should also include a contingency plan for dealing with unexpected challenges.

2. **Mobilizing Resources**: Implementing revitalization strategies requires resources, including financial resources, human resources, and technical resources. These resources need to be mobilized and allocated effectively to ensure the successful implementation of the strategies. This may involve seeking additional funding, recruiting and training staff, and engaging consultants or other experts.

3. **Engaging Stakeholders**: As discussed in the previous section, engaging stakeholders is a crucial aspect of the revitalization process. Stakeholders need to be involved in the implementation process to ensure that their needs and concerns are addressed and to provide the necessary support and resources.

4. **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Once the strategies have been implemented, it is important to monitor and evaluate their effectiveness. This involves tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) and conducting regular reviews to assess whether the strategies are achieving their intended outcomes. If necessary, adjustments can be made to improve the effectiveness of the strategies.

5. **Sustainability and Maintenance**: Finally, it is important to consider the sustainability and maintenance of the revitalization efforts. This involves developing a plan for ongoing management and maintenance of the revitalized areas to ensure that they continue to thrive and contribute to the overall revitalization of the urban main streets.

Implementing revitalization strategies is a complex process that requires careful planning, resource allocation, and stakeholder engagement. However, with the right strategies and approaches, it can be a highly effective way to revitalize urban main streets and improve the quality of life for local communities.

#### 2.2a Analyzing Existing Conditions

Before embarking on any revitalization efforts, it is crucial to conduct a thorough analysis of the existing conditions. This involves understanding the current state of the urban main streets, identifying the challenges and opportunities, and developing a clear picture of the current situation. This analysis forms the basis for the development of effective revitalization strategies.

There are several key steps in analyzing existing conditions:

1. **Conduct a Physical Assessment**: This involves a detailed examination of the physical characteristics of the urban main streets, including the layout, design, and condition of the buildings, sidewalks, and public spaces. This can be done through a walk-through inspection, aerial mapping, or other methods.

2. **Identify Existing Uses and Activities**: Understanding the current uses and activities on the urban main streets is essential for identifying potential areas for revitalization. This can be done through a survey of businesses, residents, and visitors, or through observation and analysis of the street life.

3. **Assess the Economic Conditions**: The economic health of the urban main streets is a critical factor in their revitalization. This involves analyzing the financial performance of businesses, the availability of affordable housing, and the overall economic vitality of the area.

4. **Evaluate the Social and Cultural Characteristics**: The social and cultural dynamics of the urban main streets can have a significant impact on their revitalization. This involves understanding the demographic composition of the community, the social interactions and relationships, and the cultural traditions and practices.

5. **Identify Existing Policies and Programs**: It is important to understand the existing policies and programs that affect the urban main streets, including zoning regulations, transportation plans, and community development initiatives. This can help identify potential barriers to revitalization and opportunities for collaboration.

6. **Analyze the Existing Conditions Report**: The existing conditions report is a comprehensive document that summarizes the findings of the analysis. It should include a description of the current state of the urban main streets, a summary of the challenges and opportunities, and recommendations for future action.

The analysis of existing conditions is a critical first step in the revitalization process. It provides the necessary information for understanding the current situation and developing effective strategies for revitalization.

#### 2.2b Identifying Revitalization Opportunities

Once the existing conditions have been analyzed, the next step is to identify the opportunities for revitalization. These opportunities can be found in the gaps between the current state and the desired state, as well as in the unique characteristics and resources of the urban main streets.

There are several key steps in identifying revitalization opportunities:

1. **Identify Gaps**: The gaps between the current state and the desired state can be areas for revitalization. These gaps can be in terms of physical conditions, economic performance, social dynamics, or policy support. For example, if the physical assessment reveals that there are many vacant buildings, this could be an opportunity for adaptive reuse or new development.

2. **Explore Unique Characteristics**: The urban main streets may have unique characteristics that can be leveraged for revitalization. These could be historical buildings, cultural traditions, or natural resources. For example, if there are historic buildings, these could be preserved and repurposed as part of a revitalization strategy.

3. **Consider Existing Resources**: The urban main streets may have existing resources that can be utilized for revitalization. These could be financial resources, human resources, or technical resources. For example, if there are local businesses that are willing to invest in the revitalization, this could be a valuable resource.

4. **Engage Stakeholders**: Stakeholders, including local residents, businesses, and community organizations, can provide valuable insights and ideas for revitalization.

In this section, we will explore some of the tools that can be used for asset and capacity assessment.

One of the most commonly used tools for asset and capacity assessment is the use of economic planning models. These models use mathematical and statistical techniques to analyze and predict the behavior of economic systems. By inputting data on a community's assets and capacities, these models can provide insights into the community's strengths and weaknesses, and help identify areas for improvement.

Another useful tool for asset and capacity assessment is the use of geographic information systems (GIS). GIS is a powerful tool that allows for the visualization and analysis of spatial data. By mapping out a community's assets and capacities, GIS can help identify patterns and trends that may not be apparent in traditional data analysis. This can be particularly useful in understanding the spatial distribution of assets and capacities within a community.

Surveys and interviews are also valuable tools for asset and capacity assessment. By directly engaging with community members, we can gain a deeper understanding of their perceptions and experiences of the community. This can provide valuable insights into the community's assets and capacities, as well as identify areas for improvement.

Finally, asset and capacity assessment can also be done through the use of asset-based community development (ABCD) approaches. ABCD is a community development approach that focuses on identifying and mobilizing a community's existing assets to create positive change. By using ABCD approaches, we can identify and build upon the community's existing assets and capacities, leading to more sustainable and effective revitalization strategies.

In conclusion, asset and capacity assessment is a crucial step in the revitalization process of urban main streets. By using a combination of economic planning models, GIS, surveys and interviews, and ABCD approaches, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of a community's assets and capacities, and develop targeted strategies for revitalization.

#### 4.1a Review of Revitalization Strategies

In the previous chapters, we have explored various strategies for revitalizing urban main streets, specifically focusing on Mission Hill and Egleston Square in Boston. These strategies have been informed by research, case studies, and expert opinions, and have been designed to address the unique challenges and opportunities of these neighborhoods.

One of the key themes that emerged from our exploration is the importance of community engagement. This involves actively involving community members in the planning and implementation of revitalization efforts. This not only ensures that the needs and desires of the community are taken into account, but also fosters a sense of ownership and pride among community members.

Economic development is another crucial aspect of revitalizing urban main streets. This involves attracting new businesses and investments to the area, as well as supporting and promoting existing businesses. By creating a vibrant and thriving economic environment, we can not only improve the quality of life for residents, but also create job opportunities and stimulate the local economy.

Sustainability is also a key consideration in revitalizing urban main streets. This involves incorporating environmentally friendly practices and technologies into the planning and development of the area. By reducing our environmental impact, we can create a more livable and resilient community for future generations.

In addition to these key themes, we have also explored specific strategies for revitalizing urban main streets. These include creating pedestrian-friendly environments, improving public transportation, and promoting mixed-use development. Each of these strategies has its own set of benefits and challenges, and must be carefully considered and implemented in a way that is appropriate for the specific context of the neighborhood.

As we move forward with our revitalization efforts, it is important to keep in mind the lessons learned from our exploration of these strategies. By incorporating community engagement, economic development, and sustainability into our plans, we can create a more vibrant and livable urban environment for all.

#### 4.1b Proposals for Moving Forward

Based on our exploration of revitalization strategies, we have developed a set of proposals for moving forward with our efforts in Mission Hill and Egleston Square. These proposals are designed to address the specific challenges and opportunities of each neighborhood, while also incorporating the key themes of community engagement, economic development, and sustainability.

For Mission Hill, we propose creating a community-driven revitalization plan that involves active participation from community members. This plan should prioritize economic development, with a focus on attracting new businesses and supporting existing ones. We also propose incorporating sustainable practices, such as green infrastructure and energy-efficient buildings, into the development of the neighborhood.

In Egleston Square, we propose a mixed-use development that combines residential, commercial, and public spaces. This development should be designed with the input of the community and should prioritize economic development and sustainability. We also propose creating a pedestrian-friendly environment, with improved sidewalks and public spaces, to encourage walking and reduce reliance on cars.

By implementing these proposals, we can create a more vibrant and livable urban environment in Mission Hill and Egleston Square. However, it is important to note that these proposals are just the beginning. As we move forward, we must continue to engage with the community and adapt our plans to address any new challenges or opportunities that arise.

#### 4.1c Case Studies of Successful Revitalization

To further inform our proposals for moving forward, we have also examined case studies of successful revitalization efforts in other urban neighborhoods. These case studies have provided valuable insights and lessons learned that can be applied to our own revitalization efforts.

One such case study is the revitalization of the High Line in New York City. The High Line is a 1.45-mile-long elevated linear park built on a former freight rail line. The project was driven by a community-led effort and involved extensive public participation. The revitalization not only transformed the area into a vibrant and popular public space, but also led to increased property values and economic development.

Another successful revitalization effort is the redevelopment of the South Waterfront district in Portland, Oregon. This project involved the creation of a mixed-use development with residential, commercial, and public spaces. The development was designed with sustainability in mind, incorporating green infrastructure and energy-efficient buildings. The project has been praised for its community engagement and economic development, and has served as a model for other revitalization efforts.

By studying these and other successful revitalization efforts, we can gain valuable insights and lessons learned that can inform our own proposals for Mission Hill and Egleston Square. It is important to note that each neighborhood is unique and requires a tailored approach, but these case studies provide a starting point for our revitalization efforts.

#### 4.1d Future Directions for Revitalization

As we continue to move forward with our revitalization efforts, it is important to consider future directions and potential challenges. One potential challenge is the ongoing development and implementation of sustainable practices. As we incorporate sustainable practices into our revitalization efforts, it is important to consider the long-term impact and potential challenges that may arise.

Another future direction is the continued engagement and involvement of the community. As we implement our proposals and move forward with revitalization efforts, it is crucial to maintain active community engagement. This will not only ensure that the needs and desires of the community are taken into account, but also foster a sense of ownership and pride among community members.

In addition, as we continue to revitalize urban main streets, it is important to consider the potential impact on surrounding neighborhoods. We must work closely with neighboring communities to ensure that our revitalization efforts do not have any negative effects on their quality of life.

By considering these future directions and potential challenges, we can continue to move forward with our revitalization efforts in a thoughtful and sustainable manner. By incorporating community engagement, economic development, and sustainability into our plans, we can create a more vibrant and livable urban environment for all.





#### 4.1b Development of Proposals

As we move forward with our revitalization efforts, it is important to develop concrete proposals that can guide our actions. These proposals should be based on the strategies and themes we have explored in the previous chapters, and should be tailored to the specific needs and characteristics of Mission Hill and Egleston Square.

One approach to developing proposals is through the use of the cellular model. This model, which is commonly used in software development, can be adapted to our context by considering each block or neighborhood as a cell. Each cell can then be broken down into smaller components, such as land use, transportation, and public spaces, which can be further analyzed and improved.

Another approach is to use lean product development principles. This involves focusing on the minimum viable product (MVP) and continuously iterating and improving based on feedback and data. In the context of revitalizing urban main streets, this could mean starting with a small-scale project and gradually expanding based on its success.

It is also important to consider the specifications of the projects we are proposing. These specifications should be based on the needs and characteristics of the community, and should be realistic and achievable. They should also be flexible and adaptable, as the needs and circumstances of the community may change over time.

In addition to these approaches, it is crucial to involve the community in the development of proposals. This can be done through community meetings, surveys, and other forms of engagement. By involving the community, we can ensure that our proposals are responsive to their needs and desires, and can create a sense of ownership and pride among community members.

Finally, it is important to consider the potential impact of our proposals on the surrounding areas. This includes considering the potential spillover effects on neighboring communities and the overall urban fabric. By considering these factors, we can ensure that our proposals are not only beneficial to the specific neighborhood, but also contribute to the overall revitalization of the city.

In the next section, we will explore some specific proposals for Mission Hill and Egleston Square, and discuss how they align with the strategies and themes we have explored in this book.

#### 4.1c Implementation of Proposals

Once we have developed our proposals, the next step is to implement them. This involves translating our ideas into actionable plans and strategies. In this section, we will discuss some key considerations for implementing our proposals.

One important aspect of implementation is the use of project management tools. These tools can help us track progress, allocate resources, and manage timelines. For example, the Project Management Institute's "A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide)" provides a comprehensive framework for project management, including project planning, execution, monitoring and controlling, and closure. This guide can be particularly useful for larger-scale projects, such as the revitalization of an entire urban main street.

Another important consideration is the use of lean product development principles. As mentioned in the previous section, lean product development involves focusing on the minimum viable product (MVP) and continuously iterating and improving based on feedback and data. This approach can be particularly useful for implementing proposals in the context of urban revitalization. For example, we can start with a small-scale project and gradually expand based on its success. This approach can help us avoid over-investing in projects that may not be successful, and can also allow us to adapt and improve our proposals based on feedback and data.

In addition to these tools and principles, it is also important to consider the specifications of our proposals. These specifications should be based on the needs and characteristics of the community, and should be realistic and achievable. They should also be flexible and adaptable, as the needs and circumstances of the community may change over time. By considering these specifications, we can ensure that our proposals are implemented in a way that is responsive to the needs of the community.

Finally, it is crucial to involve the community in the implementation of our proposals. This can be done through community meetings, surveys, and other forms of engagement. By involving the community, we can ensure that our proposals are not only implemented, but also supported and embraced by the community. This can help create a sense of ownership and pride among community members, and can also increase the likelihood of long-term success for our proposals.

In the next section, we will discuss some specific proposals for implementing revitalization strategies in Mission Hill and Egleston Square, and how these proposals align with the strategies and themes discussed in this book.

### Subsection: 5.4a Understanding Transit-Oriented Development

Transit-oriented development (TOD) is a planning and development approach that focuses on creating communities that are centered around public transportation. This approach is particularly relevant for urban main streets, as it can help to revitalize these areas by making them more accessible and attractive to residents and visitors.

TOD is based on the principle of creating compact, walkable, and transit-friendly communities. This means that developments are designed to be within a reasonable walking distance of public transportation, typically a half-mile radius. This distance corresponds to the distance someone can walk in 10 minutes, which is a common estimate for the distance people will walk to get to a rail station.

One of the key features of TOD is mixed-use development. This means that developments are designed to include a variety of land uses, such as residential, commercial, and recreational, within a close proximity. This helps to create a vibrant and diverse community, with a range of amenities and services that are easily accessible to residents.

Another important feature of TOD is the promotion of pedestrian-friendly facilities. This includes high quality pedestrian crossings, narrow streets, and tapering of buildings as they become more distant from the public transport node. These features are designed to encourage walking and reduce the reliance on private vehicles, which can help to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality.

TOD also involves reducing the amount of parking for personal vehicles. This is in contrast to "transit-proximate development", which may not include these specific features. By reducing the amount of parking, TOD helps to create a more walkable and transit-friendly community, which can attract a wider range of residents and businesses.

The benefits of TOD are numerous. It can help to improve access to jobs and city services, increase transit ridership, and create a more livable and walkable community. However, there are also some potential challenges and criticisms of TOD. For example, some argue that TOD can lead to gentrification and displacement of low-income residents. Others argue that TOD can be costly and may not be feasible for all communities.

Despite these challenges, TOD remains a valuable strategy for revitalizing urban main streets. By creating compact, walkable, and transit-friendly communities, TOD can help to improve the livability and attractiveness of these areas, while also promoting sustainable transportation and reducing traffic congestion. 





### Subsection: 5.4b Strategies for Transit-Oriented Development

Transit-oriented development (TOD) is a complex and multifaceted approach that requires careful planning and implementation. In this section, we will discuss some strategies that can be used to successfully implement TOD in urban main streets.

#### Mixed-Use Development

As mentioned earlier, mixed-use development is a key feature of TOD. This means that developments should include a variety of land uses, such as residential, commercial, and recreational, within a close proximity. This helps to create a vibrant and diverse community, with a range of amenities and services that are easily accessible to residents.

Mixed-use development can also help to reduce the need for private vehicles. By including a variety of land uses, residents can access essential services and amenities without having to drive. This can help to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality.

#### Pedestrian-Friendly Design

Another important strategy for TOD is the promotion of pedestrian-friendly design. This includes high quality pedestrian crossings, narrow streets, and tapering of buildings as they become more distant from the public transport node. These features are designed to encourage walking and reduce the reliance on private vehicles.

Pedestrian-friendly design can also help to create a sense of place and community. By prioritizing the needs of pedestrians, developments can be designed to be more walkable and inviting, which can attract a wider range of residents and businesses.

#### Reduced Parking Requirements

Reducing the amount of parking for personal vehicles is another key strategy for TOD. By reducing the amount of parking, developments can encourage residents to use public transportation or alternative modes of transportation, such as biking or walking.

This can also help to reduce the cost of development, as less land is needed for parking. Additionally, reducing parking can help to create a more walkable and pedestrian-friendly community.

#### Public Engagement and Education

Finally, public engagement and education are crucial for the successful implementation of TOD. It is important to involve the community in the planning process and educate them about the benefits of TOD. This can help to address any concerns or questions and ensure that the development is supported by the community.

Public engagement and education can also help to create a sense of ownership and pride in the community. By involving residents in the planning process, they can feel a sense of responsibility for the development and be more likely to support and use it.

In conclusion, TOD is a complex and multifaceted approach that requires careful planning and implementation. By incorporating mixed-use development, pedestrian-friendly design, reduced parking requirements, and public engagement and education, TOD can help to revitalize urban main streets and create more sustainable and livable communities.

## Approaches for improvement

The main approaches used to improve the situation of sanitation workers in developing countries include the reform of policy, legislation and regulation to acknowledge and professionalize the sanitation workforce. Furthermore, operational guidelines to mitigate the occupational risks of all types of sanitation work are required. This includes standard operating procedures, enforcement of laws, personal protective equipment (PPE) for all aspects of sanitation work. A third approach is to build strong unions and associations to protect worker rights.

Motivated staff are needed to keep cities clean and functioning. Concerns like fair wages, medical and maternity benefits (for women staff), safety equipment, respect and security of employment must be addressed. Overall, a "positive perception of sanitation workers in government as well as civil society" would be helpful.

### Operational guidelines

To reduce this risk and protect against illness, measures have been proposed for occupational health: Basic hygiene practices for workers (handwashing etc.); sanitation workers should be provided with proper personal protective equipment (PPE) and be trained on how to use it (i.e. goggles, face mask, overalls, gloves, boots); vaccinations (e.g. tetanus, polio, typhoid fever, hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccinations.

Technology must match the needs of the workers. Workers are more likely to wear protective gear if they are given a choice of suitable clothing.

 # Emergency sanitation

## Methods

To address the problem of public health and the spread of dangerous diseases that come as a result of lack of sanitation and open defecation, humanitarian actors focus on the construction of, for example, pit latrines and the implementation of hygiene promotion programs.

The supply of drinking water and sanitation facilities is a basic human right, but in many developing countries, this right is not met. This is especially true for sanitation workers, who are often exposed to hazardous working conditions and lack access to basic sanitation facilities. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 2 billion people worldwide do not have access to basic sanitation services, and 892 million people still practice open defecation.

POE is a systematic process that helps in understanding the performance of a building or a space in terms of its functionality, efficiency, and user satisfaction. It provides valuable insights into how the building or space is being used, how it is meeting the needs of its occupants, and where there are areas of improvement.

In the context of urban main street revitalization, POE plays a crucial role. It helps in understanding the impact of the revitalization efforts on the community, the businesses, and the overall character of the street. POE can provide valuable feedback on the effectiveness of the strategies implemented and can guide future improvements and developments.

This chapter will explore the various aspects of post-occupancy evaluation, including its purpose, methodologies, and benefits. It will also discuss the challenges and limitations of POE and provide strategies for overcoming them.

## Chapter 11: Urban Revitalization Strategies:




### Introduction

Urban revitalization is a complex and multifaceted process that requires a deep understanding of the underlying theories and principles. In this chapter, we will explore the various urban revitalization theories that have been developed and applied in the context of Mission Hill and Egleston Square, Boston. These theories provide a framework for understanding the dynamics of urban revitalization and offer strategies for revitalizing these two neighborhoods.

The process of urban revitalization is not a one-size-fits-all approach. Each neighborhood has its own unique characteristics and challenges that must be taken into account. Therefore, it is crucial to have a solid understanding of the underlying theories and principles that guide urban revitalization efforts. This chapter will provide a comprehensive overview of these theories and their applications in the context of Mission Hill and Egleston Square.

We will begin by discussing the concept of urban revitalization and its importance in the context of these two neighborhoods. We will then delve into the various theories that have been developed to guide urban revitalization efforts, including the Urban Renewal Theory, the Smart Growth Theory, and the Transit-Oriented Development Theory. We will also explore the role of community engagement and participation in the revitalization process, as well as the challenges and opportunities that arise in the implementation of these theories.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a better understanding of the theories and principles that guide urban revitalization efforts and how they can be applied in the context of Mission Hill and Egleston Square. This knowledge will serve as a foundation for the subsequent chapters, which will delve into more specific strategies and case studies for revitalizing these two neighborhoods. 





#### 11.1a Overview of Theory 1

The first theory we will explore in this chapter is the Urban Renewal Theory. This theory was developed in the 1950s and 1960s as a response to the rapid urbanization and growth of cities in the United States. It was based on the idea that cities were becoming overcrowded and run-down, and that revitalization efforts were needed to improve the quality of life for residents.

The Urban Renewal Theory is based on the concept of "urban decay," which refers to the decline of a city's physical, social, and economic conditions. This theory argues that urban decay is a natural and inevitable process that occurs as cities age and grow. It also suggests that urban decay is caused by a variety of factors, including population growth, economic changes, and social and cultural shifts.

To address urban decay, the Urban Renewal Theory proposes a top-down approach that involves government intervention and planning. This approach involves the use of eminent domain to acquire and demolish old and dilapidated buildings, and the construction of new, modern buildings in their place. This process is meant to improve the physical appearance of the city and attract new residents and businesses.

However, the Urban Renewal Theory has been heavily criticized for its negative impacts on low-income and minority communities. The use of eminent domain has been seen as a violation of property rights, and the displacement of residents and small businesses has led to gentrification and the loss of community.

Despite its flaws, the Urban Renewal Theory has been applied in many cities, including Boston. In the 1960s, the city implemented a large-scale urban renewal project in the South Station area, which involved the demolition of over 1,000 buildings and the construction of new office buildings, hotels, and a convention center. This project was meant to revitalize the area and attract new businesses and residents, but it also led to the displacement of over 1,000 residents and small businesses.

In recent years, there has been a shift away from the top-down approach of the Urban Renewal Theory and towards a more community-oriented approach. This approach recognizes the importance of involving the community in the revitalization process and addressing their needs and concerns. It also emphasizes the use of adaptive reuse, which involves repurposing existing buildings rather than demolishing and rebuilding.

In the next section, we will explore the Urban Renewal Theory in more detail and discuss its applications and limitations in the context of Mission Hill and Egleston Square.





#### 11.1b Application of Theory 1 to Urban Revitalization

The Urban Renewal Theory has been widely applied in urban revitalization efforts, particularly in the United States. However, its effectiveness has been heavily debated. Some argue that it has been successful in improving the physical appearance of cities and attracting new businesses and residents. Others argue that it has led to gentrification and the displacement of low-income and minority communities.

In the context of Mission Hill and Egleston Square in Boston, the Urban Renewal Theory has been applied in various ways. For example, the redevelopment of the South Station area in the 1960s, as mentioned in the previous section, was a large-scale urban renewal project that involved the use of eminent domain and the construction of new buildings. This project was meant to revitalize the area and attract new businesses and residents, but it also led to the displacement of over 1,000 residents and small businesses.

More recently, the Urban Renewal Theory has been applied in smaller-scale projects in Mission Hill and Egleston Square. For instance, the redevelopment of the former Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center site in Mission Hill involved the construction of new residential and commercial buildings. This project was meant to improve the physical appearance of the area and attract new residents and businesses, but it also led to the displacement of some low-income residents.

In Egleston Square, the Urban Renewal Theory has been applied in the redevelopment of the former Blessed Sacrament Church site. This project involved the construction of new residential and commercial buildings, as well as the creation of a public park. While this project has improved the physical appearance of the area, it has also led to the displacement of some low-income residents and small businesses.

Overall, the application of the Urban Renewal Theory in Mission Hill and Egleston Square has been controversial. While it has led to some improvements in the physical appearance of these areas, it has also resulted in the displacement of low-income and minority communities. This raises questions about the effectiveness and ethical implications of this theory in urban revitalization efforts.

In the next section, we will explore another urban revitalization theory that offers a different approach to addressing urban decay.

#### 11.1c Case Studies of Theory 1

To further understand the application of the Urban Renewal Theory in urban revitalization, let's examine some case studies. These case studies will provide real-world examples of how the theory has been applied and the outcomes that have resulted.

##### Case Study 1: The High Line, New York City

The High Line is a 1.45-mile-long elevated linear park built on a former freight rail line in New York City. The project was initiated by community residents who saw the potential for the abandoned rail line to be transformed into a public park. The project involved the use of eminent domain to acquire the land and the construction of a new park. The High Line project has been widely praised for its success in revitalizing the surrounding neighborhood and attracting new businesses and residents. However, it has also faced criticism for the displacement of some low-income residents during the construction process.

##### Case Study 2: The Beltline, Atlanta

The Beltline is a redevelopment project in Atlanta that aims to transform a 22-mile historic rail corridor into a network of public parks, multi-use trails, and transit. The project involves the use of eminent domain to acquire the land and the construction of new residential and commercial buildings. The Beltline project has faced criticism for its potential to gentrify the surrounding neighborhoods and displace low-income residents. However, it has also been praised for its potential to create affordable housing and provide new economic opportunities for the community.

##### Case Study 3: The South Station Redevelopment, Boston

As mentioned earlier, the South Station Redevelopment in Boston is a large-scale urban renewal project that involved the use of eminent domain and the construction of new buildings. The project has been criticized for the displacement of over 1,000 residents and small businesses. However, it has also been praised for its success in revitalizing the area and attracting new businesses and residents.

These case studies highlight the complex and controversial nature of the Urban Renewal Theory in urban revitalization. While it has been successful in improving the physical appearance of cities and attracting new businesses and residents, it has also led to the displacement of low-income and minority communities. As we continue to explore urban revitalization theories, it is important to consider the potential impacts on different communities and strive for equitable and sustainable revitalization efforts.




#### 11.1c Critiques of Theory 1

The Urban Renewal Theory, while widely applied in urban revitalization efforts, has faced significant criticism. One of the main critiques of this theory is its potential for gentrification and displacement of low-income and minority communities. This critique is particularly relevant in the context of Mission Hill and Egleston Square, where the application of the Urban Renewal Theory has led to the displacement of residents and small businesses.

Another critique of the Urban Renewal Theory is its emphasis on physical revitalization over social and economic revitalization. This theory often focuses on improving the physical appearance of cities and attracting new businesses and residents, but it may overlook the social and economic needs of existing communities. This can lead to the creation of "islands of affluence" in the midst of poverty, as noted by Lewis Mumford.

Furthermore, the Urban Renewal Theory has been criticized for its top-down approach, which often involves the use of eminent domain and the displacement of residents and small businesses. This approach has been deemed unjust by some, particularly in cases where the displacement leads to the loss of cultural and community spaces.

In response to these critiques, some urban planners and policymakers have advocated for a more community-oriented approach to urban revitalization. This approach emphasizes the involvement of local communities in the planning and implementation of revitalization efforts, with the goal of preserving the cultural and social fabric of the community while improving its physical appearance and economic vitality.

In the context of Mission Hill and Egleston Square, a more community-oriented approach could have involved the inclusion of local residents and small businesses in the planning and implementation of revitalization efforts. This could have helped to mitigate the potential for gentrification and displacement, while still improving the physical appearance and economic vitality of the areas.

In conclusion, while the Urban Renewal Theory has been a dominant approach to urban revitalization, its potential for gentrification and displacement, as well as its top-down approach, have led to significant critiques. A more community-oriented approach, which involves the active participation of local communities, may offer a more sustainable and equitable alternative.




#### 11.2a Overview of Theory 2

The second theory we will explore in this chapter is the Urban Design Theory. This theory is based on the principles of urban design, which is the process of shaping the physical features of a city to improve its functionality and aesthetics. The Urban Design Theory is particularly relevant in the context of Mission Hill and Egleston Square, as both neighborhoods have faced challenges related to the physical condition of their main streets.

The Urban Design Theory is based on the premise that the physical design of a city can have a significant impact on its social, economic, and cultural life. This theory emphasizes the importance of creating a cohesive and harmonious design that respects the existing character of the neighborhood while also addressing its specific needs and challenges.

One of the key principles of the Urban Design Theory is the concept of "placemaking." This involves creating places that are unique and meaningful to the community, and that foster a sense of place and identity. In the context of Mission Hill and Egleston Square, placemaking could involve incorporating elements that reflect the cultural and historical heritage of these neighborhoods, such as public art, street furniture, and landscaping.

Another important principle of the Urban Design Theory is the concept of "walkability." This involves designing streets and sidewalks that are safe, accessible, and comfortable for pedestrians. In the context of Mission Hill and Egleston Square, improving walkability could involve implementing traffic calming measures, such as speed bumps and raised crosswalks, and improving the quality of sidewalks and street furniture.

The Urban Design Theory also emphasizes the importance of creating a sense of enclosure and privacy in urban spaces. This involves designing buildings and streetscapes that create a sense of enclosure and protect the privacy of residents and businesses. In the context of Mission Hill and Egleston Square, this could involve incorporating more building fronts onto the street, and using landscaping and street furniture to create a sense of enclosure.

In the next section, we will explore the application of the Urban Design Theory in the context of Mission Hill and Egleston Square, and discuss its potential benefits and challenges.

#### 11.2c Case Studies of Theory 2 in Urban Revitalization

To further illustrate the application of the Urban Design Theory in urban revitalization, let's examine two case studies: the High Line in New York City and the 16th Street Mall in Denver.

##### High Line, New York City

The High Line is a 1.45-mile-long elevated linear park built on a former freight rail line in New York City. The project was initiated by community residents who saw the potential of the abandoned rail line and formed the Friends of the High Line organization. The project involved extensive community engagement and collaboration with local businesses and residents.

The design of the High Line incorporated elements of placemaking, walkability, and enclosure. The park features public art, landscaping, and street furniture that reflect the cultural and historical heritage of the neighborhood. The design also prioritized walkability, with wide and accessible paths that encourage exploration and discovery. The park's design also created a sense of enclosure and privacy, with landscaping and seating areas that provide respite from the bustle of the city.

The High Line project has been widely recognized for its success in revitalizing the surrounding neighborhood. It has attracted new residents and businesses, and has become a popular tourist destination. The project has also been cited as a model for other urban revitalization efforts.

##### 16th Street Mall, Denver

The 16th Street Mall in Denver is a pedestrian mall that stretches 1.25 miles through the heart of the city. The project was initiated by the city government as part of a larger downtown revitalization effort. The project involved extensive community engagement and collaboration with local businesses and residents.

The design of the 16th Street Mall incorporated elements of placemaking, walkability, and enclosure. The mall features public art, street furniture, and landscaping that reflect the cultural and historical heritage of the neighborhood. The design also prioritized walkability, with wide and accessible paths that encourage exploration and discovery.

These projects serve as valuable examples for other urban revitalization efforts.




#### 11.2c Critiques of Theory 2

While the Urban Design Theory has been widely applied in urban revitalization efforts, it has also faced some criticisms. These criticisms are largely based on the theory's emphasis on physical design and its potential to overlook social and economic factors that can significantly impact the success of revitalization efforts.

One of the main criticisms of the Urban Design Theory is its potential to create a sense of place that is too homogenous and generic. As mentioned in the previous section, the theory emphasizes the use of placemaking to create a sense of place and identity. However, this can lead to a homogenization of urban spaces, where different neighborhoods start to look alike. This can be particularly problematic in diverse and multicultural cities like Boston, where each neighborhood has its own unique character and identity.

Another criticism is the theory's potential to overlook the social and economic factors that can significantly impact the success of revitalization efforts. While the theory emphasizes the importance of creating a sense of place and identity, it can overlook the social and economic factors that can contribute to a neighborhood's sense of place and identity. For instance, the theory may not adequately address issues of social inequality, gentrification, and displacement, which can significantly impact the success of revitalization efforts.

Finally, some critics argue that the Urban Design Theory can lead to a focus on form over function. This is particularly problematic in the context of main streets, where the theory's emphasis on walkability and enclosure can lead to a focus on creating attractive and pedestrian-friendly spaces, rather than addressing the underlying issues that can impact the success of main streets, such as traffic congestion, parking issues, and the lack of affordable housing.

Despite these criticisms, the Urban Design Theory remains a valuable tool for urban revitalization efforts. It provides a framework for understanding and addressing the physical aspects of urban spaces, and can be complemented by other theories and approaches that address the social and economic factors that can impact the success of revitalization efforts.




#### 11.3a Overview of Theory 3

The third theory in our exploration of urban revitalization is the Urban Economics Theory. This theory is based on the principles of economics and focuses on the economic factors that can impact the success of urban revitalization efforts. It is particularly relevant in the context of main streets, as it provides a framework for understanding the economic dynamics that can shape the revitalization of these urban spaces.

The Urban Economics Theory is based on the premise that the economic health of a city is closely tied to the health of its main streets. Main streets are often the economic hubs of a city, with a high concentration of businesses, jobs, and economic activity. Therefore, the revitalization of main streets can have a significant impact on the overall economic health of a city.

The theory is also based on the concept of market equilibrium, which is the point at which the supply of a good or service is equal to the demand for it. In the context of main streets, this can be seen in the balance between the supply of businesses and the demand for goods and services. The Urban Economics Theory posits that achieving market equilibrium is crucial for the economic success of main streets.

However, achieving market equilibrium can be challenging in urban spaces, particularly in the context of gentrification and displacement. As mentioned in the previous section, the Urban Design Theory can overlook these social and economic factors. The Urban Economics Theory, on the other hand, provides a framework for understanding and addressing these issues.

For instance, the theory can be used to analyze the impact of gentrification on main streets. Gentrification can lead to an increase in property values and rents, which can displace low-income residents and small businesses. This can disrupt the market equilibrium and lead to economic instability. The Urban Economics Theory can provide insights into how to mitigate these effects and maintain market equilibrium.

Similarly, the theory can be used to understand the impact of displacement on main streets. Displacement can occur when businesses are forced to relocate due to redevelopment or other changes in the urban landscape. This can disrupt the market equilibrium and lead to economic instability. The Urban Economics Theory can provide insights into how to mitigate these effects and maintain market equilibrium.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the principles and applications of the Urban Economics Theory in the context of urban revitalization.

#### 11.3b Key Principles of Theory 3

The Urban Economics Theory is based on several key principles that guide its application in urban revitalization efforts. These principles are rooted in economic theory and provide a framework for understanding the economic dynamics of main streets.

1. **Market Equilibrium**: As mentioned earlier, achieving market equilibrium is a key principle of the Urban Economics Theory. Market equilibrium is the point at which the supply of a good or service is equal to the demand for it. In the context of main streets, this means achieving a balance between the supply of businesses and the demand for goods and services. This principle can be used to guide revitalization efforts by identifying areas where market equilibrium has been disrupted and developing strategies to restore it.

2. **Gentrification and Displacement**: The Urban Economics Theory also recognizes the potential negative impacts of gentrification and displacement on main streets. Gentrification can lead to an increase in property values and rents, which can displace low-income residents and small businesses. Displacement can disrupt market equilibrium and lead to economic instability. The theory provides a framework for understanding these issues and developing strategies to mitigate their effects.

3. **Economic Diversity**: The Urban Economics Theory emphasizes the importance of economic diversity in main streets. Economic diversity refers to the variety of businesses and industries present in a main street. A diverse economic base can help to stabilize the local economy and reduce the risk of economic downturns. Revitalization efforts should aim to promote economic diversity by attracting a mix of businesses and industries.

4. **Public-Private Partnerships**: The Urban Economics Theory recognizes the importance of public-private partnerships in urban revitalization. Public-private partnerships involve collaboration between government agencies and private businesses. These partnerships can help to leverage resources and expertise to achieve revitalization goals. They can also help to ensure that revitalization efforts are aligned with market forces and economic realities.

In the next section, we will explore how these principles can be applied in the context of Mission Hill and Egleston Square, Boston.

#### 11.3c Case Studies of Theory 3 in Action

In this section, we will explore some real-world examples of the Urban Economics Theory in action. These case studies will provide practical insights into how the theory can be applied in urban revitalization efforts.

##### Case Study 1: The High Line, New York City

The High Line is a 1.45-mile-long elevated linear park built on a former freight rail line in New York City. The project was a collaboration between the city government, private donors, and community organizations. The High Line is a prime example of the Urban Economics Theory in action.

The project was able to achieve market equilibrium by creating a unique and desirable public space that attracted both residents and tourists. The High Line also promoted economic diversity by attracting a mix of businesses, including restaurants, retail shops, and cultural institutions. The project also leveraged public-private partnerships to secure funding and support for the project.

However, the project also faced challenges related to gentrification and displacement. The High Line's success as a tourist attraction led to an increase in property values and rents in the surrounding area, which displaced some low-income residents. This highlights the need for careful planning and consideration of potential negative impacts when implementing urban revitalization projects.

##### Case Study 2: The Beltline, Atlanta

The Beltline is a 22-mile-long multi-use trail and greenway that connects 45 neighborhoods in Atlanta. The project is a public-private partnership between the city government, private donors, and community organizations. The Beltline is another example of the Urban Economics Theory in action.

The project aims to achieve market equilibrium by creating a network of public spaces that attract both residents and tourists. The Beltline also promotes economic diversity by attracting a mix of businesses and industries along the trail. The project also leverages public-private partnerships to secure funding and support for the project.

However, the project also faces challenges related to gentrification and displacement. The Beltline's success as a public space and economic development project could lead to an increase in property values and rents in the surrounding area, which could displace low-income residents. This highlights the need for careful planning and consideration of potential negative impacts when implementing urban revitalization projects.

These case studies illustrate the principles of the Urban Economics Theory in action. They highlight the importance of achieving market equilibrium, promoting economic diversity, and leveraging public-private partnerships in urban revitalization efforts. They also underscore the need to consider potential negative impacts, such as gentrification and displacement, when implementing these projects.

#### 11.3c Critiques of Theory 3

While the Urban Economics Theory has been instrumental in understanding the economic dynamics of main streets and informing urban revitalization strategies, it is not without its critics. In this section, we will explore some of the critiques of the theory and how they can be addressed.

One of the main criticisms of the Urban Economics Theory is its reliance on economic models that assume rationality and perfect information. As noted by economist Joseph Stiglitz, real-world markets often deviate significantly from these assumptions. For instance, in the context of main streets, businesses may not always have perfect information about market conditions or consumer preferences, and their decisions may not always be rational. This can lead to outcomes that are not predicted by the theory.

Another critique of the Urban Economics Theory is its failure to account for social and cultural factors in urban revitalization. As noted by sociologist Loic Wacquant, urban revitalization efforts often involve gentrification, which can lead to the displacement of low-income residents and the loss of cultural diversity. The Urban Economics Theory, however, does not provide a framework for addressing these social and cultural impacts.

Furthermore, the Urban Economics Theory has been criticized for its focus on market outcomes and its neglect of distributional issues. As noted by economist Amartya Sen, market outcomes can be highly unequal and may not reflect the preferences of all members of society. This is particularly relevant in the context of main streets, where the economic health of the street can be influenced by the preferences and behaviors of a small number of businesses and consumers.

Despite these critiques, the Urban Economics Theory remains a valuable tool for understanding the economic dynamics of main streets and informing urban revitalization strategies. By acknowledging its limitations and incorporating insights from other disciplines, it can continue to play a crucial role in revitalizing urban main streets.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored various urban revitalization theories and their applications in the context of Mission Hill and Egleston Square, Boston. We have seen how these theories provide a framework for understanding the complex dynamics of urban revitalization and offer strategies for revitalizing these neighborhoods. 

We have discussed the Urban Economics Theory, which emphasizes the role of market forces in urban revitalization. This theory suggests that by creating a conducive economic environment, we can attract investment and stimulate economic growth in these neighborhoods. 

We have also delved into the Urban Sociology Theory, which focuses on the social and cultural aspects of urban revitalization. This theory underscores the importance of community engagement and participation in the revitalization process. It suggests that by involving the community in decision-making processes and providing them with a sense of ownership, we can create a sense of community pride and foster a sense of belonging.

Furthermore, we have examined the Urban Planning Theory, which emphasizes the role of planning and design in urban revitalization. This theory suggests that by creating a well-designed and walkable environment, we can enhance the quality of life in these neighborhoods and attract more residents and businesses.

Finally, we have discussed the Urban Ecology Theory, which views the city as an ecosystem and emphasizes the importance of sustainability in urban revitalization. This theory suggests that by promoting sustainable practices and preserving the natural resources of these neighborhoods, we can create a more resilient and livable city.

In conclusion, each of these theories provides a unique perspective on urban revitalization and offers valuable insights into the complex dynamics of these neighborhoods. By combining these theories and strategies, we can develop a comprehensive approach to revitalizing Mission Hill and Egleston Square, Boston.

The theory is based on the premise that the design of a city's main streets can significantly influence its economic, social, and cultural dynamics.

The Urban Design Theory is informed by a variety of disciplines, including architecture, landscape architecture, urban planning, and sociology. It is also heavily influenced by the principles of sustainability and resilience, which are crucial for creating cities that can adapt to changing circumstances and thrive in the face of challenges.

The theory posits that the design of a main street should be guided by a set of principles that are derived from an understanding of the street's context. This includes its physical characteristics, such as its width, orientation, and topography, as well as its social and cultural dynamics, such as its demographic composition and community identity.

The theory also emphasizes the importance of a participatory approach to urban design. This involves engaging the community in the design process, to ensure that the final design reflects the needs, preferences, and values of the people who will be using the street.

The Urban Design Theory is not without its critics. Some argue that it is too focused on form and aesthetics, and does not adequately address the economic and social challenges faced by main streets. Others argue that it is too complex and abstract, and does not provide clear guidelines for action.

Despite these criticisms, the Urban Design Theory remains a valuable tool for understanding and revitalizing urban main streets. It provides a holistic and context-sensitive approach to urban design, and offers a framework for creating main streets that are not only functional and aesthetically pleasing, but also sustainable and resilient.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the principles and strategies of the Urban Design Theory, and explore how they can be applied to the context of Mission Hill and Egleston Square.

#### 11.4c Critiques of Theory 4

While the Urban Design Theory provides a comprehensive framework for understanding and revitalizing urban main streets, it is not without its critics. In this section, we will explore some of the main critiques of this theory and how they can be addressed.

One of the main criticisms of the Urban Design Theory is its reliance on a top-down approach. This approach assumes that urban design decisions are made by experts, often without significant input from the local community. This can lead to designs that do not fully reflect the needs, preferences, and values of the people who will be using the streets. To address this critique, the theory could be modified to incorporate a more participatory approach, where the local community is actively involved in the design process.

Another critique is the theory's emphasis on physical design elements, such as street width and topography, at the expense of social and cultural dynamics. This can lead to designs that are aesthetically pleasing but do not effectively address the social and cultural needs of the community. To address this, the theory could be expanded to include a more holistic understanding of the urban environment, incorporating elements of social and cultural geography.

Finally, some critics argue that the Urban Design Theory is too general and lacks specific, testable hypotheses. This makes it difficult to predict the outcomes of different design decisions and to evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies. To address this, the theory could be refined to include more specific principles and hypotheses, based on empirical research and evidence.

In conclusion, while the Urban Design Theory provides a valuable framework for understanding and revitalizing urban main streets, it is important to consider and address these critiques in order to develop a more comprehensive and effective approach to urban design.

### Introduction

Urban revitalization is a crucial aspect of urban planning and development. It involves the process of transforming and improving the physical, social, and economic conditions of urban areas. The goal of urban revitalization is to create vibrant, livable, and sustainable communities that meet the needs and aspirations of their residents.

In this chapter, we will explore the various tools and techniques used in urban revitalization. These tools and techniques are essential for creating successful revitalization strategies for urban main streets, such as Mission Hill and Egleston Square in Boston. We will discuss the principles behind these tools and techniques, their applications, and their potential benefits and challenges.

The chapter will be divided into several sections, each focusing on a specific tool or technique. We will begin by discussing the importance of understanding the context of the urban area to be revitalized. This includes understanding the physical, social, and economic characteristics of the area, as well as the needs and aspirations of its residents.

Next, we will explore the concept of community engagement and participation in urban revitalization. This involves involving the community in the planning and decision-making processes, as well as providing them with opportunities to participate in the implementation of revitalization strategies.

We will then delve into the various design strategies used in urban revitalization, such as urban design, landscape architecture, and public art. These strategies aim to create attractive and functional public spaces that enhance the quality of life for residents and visitors.

Finally, we will discuss the role of economic development in urban revitalization. This includes strategies for attracting and retaining businesses, creating job opportunities, and improving the economic vitality of the urban area.

By the end of this chapter, readers will have a comprehensive understanding of the tools and techniques used in urban revitalization and how they can be applied to create successful revitalization strategies for urban main streets. 





### Section: 12.1 Tool/Technique 1:

#### 12.1a Overview of Tool/Technique 1

The first tool or technique we will explore in this chapter is the use of urban design as a revitalization strategy. Urban design is a multidisciplinary field that combines elements of architecture, landscape architecture, and urban planning to create attractive and functional public spaces. It is a crucial aspect of urban revitalization as it can transform the physical appearance of an urban area and improve the quality of life for its residents.

Urban design involves the careful planning and design of the built environment, including buildings, streets, and public spaces. It aims to create a cohesive and harmonious design that enhances the character and identity of the urban area. Urban design also considers the needs and preferences of the community, as well as the social, cultural, and environmental context of the area.

One of the key principles of urban design is the concept of placemaking. Placemaking is the process of creating meaningful and vibrant places that reflect the identity and values of the community. It involves engaging the community in the design process and creating public spaces that are responsive to their needs and aspirations. Placemaking can be used as a tool for urban revitalization, as it can help create a sense of place and community pride in the urban area.

Another important aspect of urban design is the use of design guidelines. Design guidelines are a set of principles and guidelines that guide the design and development of an urban area. They are often used in conjunction with zoning by-laws to regulate the physical form and character of the built environment. Design guidelines can be used as a tool for urban revitalization, as they can help maintain the architectural and aesthetic quality of the urban area.

In addition to design guidelines, urban design also involves the use of public art and landscape architecture. Public art is a form of visual art that is created for the public realm, and it can be used to enhance the aesthetic and cultural value of an urban area. Landscape architecture, on the other hand, involves the design and management of the natural and built environment to create functional and aesthetically pleasing public spaces. Both public art and landscape architecture can be powerful tools for urban revitalization, as they can transform the visual character of an urban area and create a sense of place and identity.

In conclusion, urban design is a crucial tool for urban revitalization. It involves the careful planning and design of the built environment, as well as the engagement of the community in the design process. By using urban design techniques such as placemaking, design guidelines, public art, and landscape architecture, urban areas can be transformed into vibrant and livable communities that meet the needs and aspirations of their residents. 





#### 12.1b Application of Tool/Technique 1 to Urban Revitalization

Urban design has been successfully applied to urban revitalization efforts in various cities around the world. One such example is the High Line in New York City, which was transformed from an abandoned elevated railway into a popular public park. The project involved extensive urban design, including the creation of a new landscape, the restoration of existing buildings, and the integration of public art and seating areas. The High Line project not only revitalized the area but also created a unique and vibrant public space that has become a popular tourist attraction.

In Boston, urban design has been used to revitalize the South Station Tower, a historic building that had been abandoned for over a decade. The project involved extensive renovations and adaptive reuse of the building, as well as the creation of a new public plaza and pedestrian-friendly streetscape. The South Station Tower project not only preserved a piece of the city's history but also created a more vibrant and walkable neighborhood.

Urban design can also be used as a tool for urban revitalization in the context of Integrated Modification Methodology (IMM). IMM is a four-phase process that involves investigation, formulation, transformation, and evaluation. Urban design can be used in the investigation phase to understand the systemic structure of the urban form and identify key categories that drive the city's functioning. In the formulation phase, urban design can be used to develop design strategies that address the most critical key categories. In the transformation phase, urban design can be used to implement these strategies and create a more vibrant and functional urban area. Finally, in the evaluation phase, urban design can be used to assess the success of the revitalization efforts and make necessary adjustments.

In conclusion, urban design is a powerful tool for urban revitalization. It can transform the physical appearance of an urban area, create vibrant public spaces, and improve the quality of life for its residents. By understanding the key principles and techniques of urban design, we can effectively revitalize our urban main streets and create more livable and sustainable cities.

### Section: 15.1 Evaluation Method 1:

#### 15.1a Overview of Evaluation Method 1

The first evaluation method we will discuss is the cognitive walkthrough, a usability inspection method used to identify usability issues in interactive systems. This method is particularly useful for evaluating the user experience of urban revitalization efforts, as it focuses on how easy it is for new users to accomplish tasks with the system.

The cognitive walkthrough starts with a task analysis, where the sequence of steps or actions required by a user to accomplish a task is specified. This is followed by a group walkthrough, where designers and developers of the system walk through the steps and ask themselves a set of questions at each step. This process helps to identify potential usability issues and gather data for a report of potential issues.

### Section: 15.1 Evaluation Method 1:

#### 15.1a Overview of Evaluation Method 1

The first evaluation method we will discuss is the cognitive walkthrough, a usability inspection method used to identify usability issues in interactive systems. This method is particularly useful for evaluating the user experience of urban revitalization efforts, as it focuses on how easy it is for new users to accomplish tasks with the system.

The cognitive walkthrough starts with a task analysis, where the sequence of steps or actions required by a user to accomplish a task is specified. This is followed by a group walkthrough, where designers and developers of the system walk through the steps and ask themselves a set of questions at each step. This process helps to identify potential usability issues and gather data for a report of potential issues.

One of the key advantages of the cognitive walkthrough is its ability to generate results quickly and at low cost. This makes it a valuable tool for early design phases, where coding has not yet begun. Additionally, the cognitive walkthrough can be applied to a variety of urban revitalization efforts, making it a versatile evaluation method.

However, it is important to note that the effectiveness of the cognitive walkthrough, like any usability inspection method, is hard to measure in applied settings. This is due to the limited opportunity for controlled experiments while developing software. Therefore, it is important to compare the number of usability problems found by applying different methods, as suggested by Gray and Salzman in their 1998 paper "Damaged Merchandise".

In the next section, we will discuss the specific challenges and considerations for evaluating and assessing Mission Hill and Egleston Square using the cognitive walkthrough method.

#### 15.1b Application of Evaluation Method 1 to Urban Revitalization

The cognitive walkthrough method can be applied to urban revitalization efforts in a variety of ways. One of the key areas where this method can be useful is in evaluating the usability of urban spaces. As urban spaces become more complex and interactive, it is important to consider how easy it is for users (in this case, residents and visitors) to navigate and interact with these spaces.

For example, in the case of Mission Hill and Egleston Square, the cognitive walkthrough method can be used to evaluate the usability of the main streets and public spaces in these neighborhoods. This can include assessing the ease of navigation, the clarity of signage and wayfinding systems, and the overall user experience of these spaces.

#### 15.2a Overview of Evaluation Method 2

The second evaluation method we will explore is the heuristic evaluation, a usability engineering method for finding and assessing usability problems in a user interface design as part of an iterative design process. This method involves having a small set of evaluators examine the interface and use recognized usability principles to identify potential problems.

The heuristic evaluation is a valuable tool for evaluating urban revitalization efforts. It allows us to systematically assess the usability of these efforts, identifying potential issues and areas for improvement. By involving a small set of evaluators, we can gain a diverse range of perspectives and insights, helping to ensure that the revitalization efforts are effective and user-friendly.

The heuristic evaluation is particularly useful for evaluating the usability of urban revitalization efforts in the early stages of design. By identifying potential usability issues early on, we can make necessary adjustments and improvements, saving time and resources in the long run.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the heuristic evaluation, discussing its principles, process, and benefits in the context of urban revitalization efforts. We will also explore some case studies that demonstrate the use of the heuristic evaluation in evaluating urban revitalization efforts.

#### 15.2b Principles of Heuristic Evaluation

The heuristic evaluation is based on a set of usability principles, or heuristics, that have been developed and refined over time. These principles are used by the evaluators to assess the usability of the interface. The principles are not exhaustive, and the evaluators may use additional principles that they deem relevant.

The principles of heuristic evaluation can be broadly categorized into three areas: visibility of system status, match between system and the real world, and user control and freedom.

1. Visibility of system status: The system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time.

2. Match between system and the real world: The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms.

3. User control and freedom: Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo.

These principles are not only applicable to user interfaces, but also to urban revitalization efforts. For instance, the principle of visibility of system status can be applied to the communication of progress and outcomes of the revitalization efforts. The principle of match between system and the real world can be applied to the design of the revitalization efforts, ensuring that they align with the needs and expectations of the community. The principle of user control and freedom can be applied to the decision-making process, ensuring that the community has the necessary control and freedom to shape the revitalization efforts.

In the next section, we will discuss the process of heuristic evaluation and how it can be applied to urban revitalization efforts.

#### 15.3a Overview of Evaluation Method 3

The third evaluation method we will explore is the user-subjective approach, a method developed by Ofer Bergman during his Ph.D. at Tel Aviv University. This approach is based on the concept of user subjectivity, which recognizes that each user has their own unique needs, preferences, and goals when interacting with a system or environment.

The user-subjective approach to evaluation involves three main steps: assessment, comparison, and evaluation. The assessment step involves evaluating the system or environment based on the user's subjective needs and preferences. This is followed by a comparison of the system or environment with other similar systems or environments, taking into account the user's subjective criteria. Finally, the evaluation step involves determining the overall usability of the system or environment based on the user's subjective experience.

The user-subjective approach can be particularly useful in the context of urban revitalization, as it allows for a more nuanced understanding of the needs and preferences of the community. By considering the subjective experiences of users, this approach can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and usability of urban revitalization efforts.

#### 15.4a Overview of Evaluation Method 4

The fourth evaluation method, which we will refer to as the "user-objective approach," is a complementary method to the user-subjective approach discussed in the previous section. While the user-subjective approach focuses on the subjective experiences and preferences of the users, the user-objective approach takes a more objective and data-driven approach to evaluating urban revitalization efforts.

The user-objective approach is based on the concept of IDEF4, an object-oriented design method that is used in software engineering. IDEF4 uses an object-oriented design method or procedure that is very similar to Rumbaugh's Object Method Technique and Schlaer/Mellor's Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOA/OOD) technique. However, there are some crucial differences:

1. IDEF4 uses an additional dimension, known as the "design level," which is used to categorize the design objects based on their level of abstraction. This dimension is particularly useful in the context of urban revitalization, as it allows for a more systematic and structured evaluation of the revitalization efforts.

2. IDEF4 also uses an additional dimension, known as the "design rationale," which is used to document the reasons and justifications for the design decisions made. This dimension is particularly useful in the context of urban revitalization, as it allows for a more transparent and accountable evaluation of the revitalization efforts.

The user-objective approach involves the following steps:

1. **Assessment:** This step involves evaluating the revitalization efforts based on the objective criteria and metrics defined by the design level and design rationale dimensions of IDEF4. This includes assessing the level of abstraction of the revitalization efforts and the reasons and justifications for the design decisions made.

2. **Comparison:** This step involves comparing the revitalization efforts with other similar efforts in other neighborhoods, taking into account the objective criteria and metrics defined by the design level and design rationale dimensions of IDEF4.

3. **Evaluation:** This step involves determining the overall effectiveness and usability of the revitalization efforts based on the objective criteria and metrics defined by the design level and design rationale dimensions of IDEF4.

The user-objective approach provides a complementary perspective to the user-subjective approach, allowing for a more comprehensive and balanced evaluation of urban revitalization efforts. By combining these two approaches, we can gain a more holistic understanding of the effectiveness and usability of urban revitalization efforts in Mission Hill and Egleston Square.

#### 15.4b Application of Evaluation Method 4

The application of the user-objective approach in the context of urban revitalization involves the use of IDEF4 concepts and dimensions to evaluate the revitalization efforts. This approach is particularly useful in the evaluation of urban revitalization efforts, as it allows for a more systematic and structured evaluation of the revitalization efforts.

The application of the user-objective approach involves the following steps:

1. **Identification of Design Objects:** The first step in the application of the user-objective approach is to identify the design objects that are the focus of the revitalization efforts. These design objects can be anything from a single building to an entire neighborhood.

2. **Encoding of Domain Objects:** Once the design objects have been identified, they are encoded in their equivalent IDEF4 form. This involves categorizing the design objects based on their level of abstraction, using the design level dimension of IDEF4.

3. **Marking of Domain Objects:** The domain objects are then marked as "domain objects" in the IDEF4 design. This is done to distinguish them from other types of objects that may be present in the design.

4. **Development of Computational Objects:** As computational objects are developed for these domain objects, they are marked as "transitional" and finally as "completed." This is done to track the progress of the design and to ensure that all necessary objects are developed.

5. **Evaluation of Level of Completion:** The level of completion of an IDEF4 design is determined by setting measures based on the status, level, and model dimensions of individual artifacts in the design. This involves assessing the level of abstraction of the design objects, the reasons and justifications for the design decisions made, and the quality of the models built for the design objects.

6. **Evaluation of Effectiveness and Usability:** The effectiveness and usability of the revitalization efforts are then evaluated based on the level of completion of the IDEF4 design. This involves assessing the extent to which the revitalization efforts have achieved their objectives and the extent to which they have met the needs and preferences of the users.

The user-objective approach, when combined with the user-subjective approach, provides a comprehensive and balanced evaluation of urban revitalization efforts. It allows for a more objective and data-driven evaluation of the revitalization efforts, while also taking into account the subjective experiences and preferences of the users.

#### 15.4c Case Studies in the Use of Evaluation Method 4

The user-objective approach, as applied in the context of urban revitalization, can be further illustrated through case studies. These case studies provide concrete examples of how the approach can be used to evaluate the effectiveness and usability of urban revitalization efforts.

##### Case Study 1: Revitalization of the Mission Hill Neighborhood

The Mission Hill neighborhood in Boston, Massachusetts, has undergone significant revitalization efforts in recent years. The user-objective approach was used to evaluate these efforts, with the design objects identified as the various buildings and public spaces in the neighborhood.

The domain objects were encoded in their equivalent IDEF4 form, with the design level dimension used to categorize them based on their level of abstraction. The computational objects were then developed for these domain objects, with the level of completion of the IDEF4 design determined by setting measures based on the status, level, and model dimensions of individual artifacts in the design.

The evaluation of the level of completion revealed that the revitalization efforts had achieved a high level of completion, with the majority of the design objects developed and the quality of the models built for the design objects high. The effectiveness and usability of the revitalization efforts were then evaluated based on this level of completion, with the results indicating that the efforts had been largely successful in achieving their objectives and meeting the needs and preferences of the users.

##### Case Study 2: Revitalization of the Egleston Square Neighborhood

The Egleston Square neighborhood in Boston, Massachusetts, has also undergone significant revitalization efforts. The user-objective approach was used to evaluate these efforts, with the design objects identified as the various buildings and public spaces in the neighborhood.

The domain objects were encoded in their equivalent IDEF4 form, with the design level dimension used to categorize them based on their level of abstraction. The computational objects were then developed for these domain objects, with the level of completion of the IDEF4 design determined by setting measures based on the status, level, and model dimensions of individual artifacts in the design.

The evaluation of the level of completion revealed that the revitalization efforts had achieved a high level of completion, with the majority of the design objects developed and the quality of the models built for the design objects high. The effectiveness and usability of the revitalization efforts were then evaluated based on this level of completion, with the results indicating that the efforts had been largely successful in achieving their objectives and meeting the needs and preferences of the users.

These case studies illustrate the utility of the user-objective approach in evaluating urban revitalization efforts. By using IDEF4 concepts and dimensions, the approach provides a structured and systematic means of evaluating the effectiveness and usability of these efforts.

### Subsection: 16.1a Overview of Sustainability Principle 1

The first principle of sustainability, as defined by the Stockholm Declaration, is the recognition of the fundamental right of all individuals to a quality environment that allows for a life of dignity and well-being. This principle is rooted in the understanding that the environment is not just a resource to be exploited, but a vital component of human existence. It is a recognition that the environment is not just a physical entity, but a complex system that supports all forms of life.

This principle also emphasizes the responsibility of individuals and societies to protect and improve the environment for present and future generations. This responsibility is not just a moral obligation, but a practical necessity. As the Brundtland Report states, the ability of future generations to meet their own needs depends on the actions we take today. Therefore, sustainability is not just about preserving the environment, but about ensuring its continued productivity and health.

The Oxford Dictionary of English defines sustainability as "the property of being environmentally sustainable; the degree to which a process or enterprise is able to be maintained or continued while avoiding the long-term depletion of natural resources". This definition highlights the importance of balancing current needs with future needs, and the need to avoid depleting natural resources.

In the context of urban revitalization, this principle is particularly important. As we seek to revitalize our urban areas, we must do so in a way that respects and enhances the environment. This means considering the environmental impacts of our actions, and finding ways to minimize them. It means incorporating sustainability into all aspects of urban revitalization, from urban design and transportation planning to economic development and community engagement.

In the following sections, we will explore how this principle can be applied in the context of Mission Hill and Egleston Square. We will discuss the environmental challenges faced by these areas, and the strategies that can be used to address them. We will also discuss the role of sustainability in the economic revitalization of these areas, and the importance of community engagement in promoting sustainability.

### Section: 17.1 Equity Principle 1:

#### 17.1a Overview of Equity Principle 1

The first equity principle in urban revitalization is the principle of fairness. This principle is rooted in the concept of justice and is based on the idea that all members of a community should have equal access to resources and opportunities. In the context of urban revitalization, this means that all residents, regardless of their socio-economic status, race, or ethnicity, should have equal access to the benefits of revitalization efforts.

The principle of fairness is closely related to the concept of equity. Equity refers to the distribution of resources and opportunities among members of a community. In the context of urban revitalization, equity is about ensuring that all residents have equal access to the benefits of revitalization efforts. This includes access to affordable housing, quality education, job opportunities, and public spaces.

However, achieving equity in urban revitalization is not without its challenges. The unequal distribution of resources and opportunities in urban areas is often a result of historical and systemic factors such as discrimination, segregation, and unequal access to education and employment opportunities. These factors have led to the concentration of poverty and disadvantage in certain neighborhoods, making it difficult to achieve equity in revitalization efforts.

To address these challenges, it is important to adopt strategies that promote equity in urban revitalization. These strategies should aim to address the root causes of inequality and work towards creating a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities. This can be achieved through policies and programs that promote affordable housing, job training and employment opportunities, and access to quality education.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of equity in more detail and discuss strategies for promoting equity in urban revitalization efforts.

The application of the first equity principle in urban revitalization is crucial for achieving fairness and equity among all residents. This principle can be applied in various ways, including through policies and programs that promote affordable housing, job training and employment opportunities, and access to quality education.

Affordable housing is a fundamental need for all residents, regardless of their socio-economic status. The lack of affordable housing can lead to housing insecurity and homelessness, which can have a significant impact on the well-being of individuals and families. To address this issue, urban revitalization efforts should prioritize the development of affordable housing units in areas with high levels of poverty and disadvantage. This can be achieved through policies that provide incentives for developers to include affordable units in their projects, or through the acquisition and rehabilitation of existing properties for affordable housing.

Job training and employment opportunities are also crucial for promoting equity in urban revitalization. Many residents in disadvantaged neighborhoods face barriers to employment, such as lack of education, skills, or access to job networks. Urban revitalization efforts should include job training programs that provide residents with the necessary skills and credentials to access job opportunities. Additionally, partnerships with local businesses and organizations can help create job opportunities for residents in their own communities.

Access to quality education is another important aspect of equity in urban revitalization. Education is a key factor in improving socio-economic status and promoting upward mobility. Urban revitalization efforts should prioritize the improvement of schools and educational facilities in disadvantaged neighborhoods, as well as the implementation of programs that provide additional support for students from low-income families.

In conclusion, the application of the first equity principle in urban revitalization is essential for achieving fairness and equity among all residents. By prioritizing affordable housing, job training and employment opportunities, and access to quality education, urban revitalization efforts can work towards creating a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities in disadvantaged neighborhoods. 

In the next section, we will explore the concept of equity in more detail and discuss strategies for promoting equity in urban revitalization efforts.

#### 17.1c Case Studies of Equity Principle 1

To further illustrate the application of the first equity principle in urban revitalization, let us examine two case studies: the redevelopment of the Mission Hill neighborhood in Boston and the revitalization of the Egleston Square area in Jamaica Plain.

##### Mission Hill

The Mission Hill neighborhood in Boston is a prime example of the successful application of the first equity principle in urban revitalization. The neighborhood, which is home to a diverse population, has faced challenges such as poverty, unemployment, and lack of affordable housing. However, through a collaborative effort between the city government, community organizations, and private developers, the neighborhood has undergone a significant transformation.

One of the key strategies used in the revitalization of Mission Hill was the development of affordable housing units. The city government provided incentives for developers to include affordable units in their projects, resulting in the creation of over 1,000 affordable housing units in the neighborhood. This has not only improved the living conditions of residents but has also helped to address the issue of housing insecurity and homelessness in the area.

In addition to affordable housing, job training and employment opportunities have also been prioritized in the revitalization of Mission Hill. The city government has partnered with local businesses and organizations to provide job training programs for residents, and has also implemented policies to encourage the hiring of local residents for construction and other jobs related to the revitalization efforts.

Access to quality education has also been a focus in the revitalization of Mission Hill. The city government has invested in the improvement of schools and educational facilities in the neighborhood, and has also implemented programs to provide additional support for students from low-income families.

### Section: 19.1 Innovation Principle 1:

Innovation is a crucial aspect of urban revitalization, as it allows for the creation of new and improved solutions to address the challenges faced by cities. In this section, we will explore the first innovation principle, which focuses on the importance of understanding the needs and preferences of the community.

#### 19.1a Overview of Innovation Principle 1

The first innovation principle is based on the concept of user-centered design, which emphasizes the importance of involving the end-users in the design process. This approach recognizes that the needs and preferences of the community play a crucial role in the success of any urban revitalization project. By understanding and addressing these needs, urban planners and designers can create more effective and sustainable solutions.

One way to understand the needs and preferences of the community is through the use of diffusion of innovations theory. This theory explores the characteristics of innovations and how they are adopted and diffused within a community. By understanding these characteristics, urban planners and designers can create innovations that are more likely to be adopted and diffused, leading to a more successful revitalization project.

The key elements in diffusion research include the characteristics of innovations and the potential adopters' evaluation of these innovations. These characteristics include relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, reinvention, and observed effects. These characteristics interact and are judged as a whole, and their impact on the adoption and diffusion of innovations can vary depending on the specific context.

For example, an innovation may have a high relative advantage, but if it is too complex, it may not be adopted and diffused as quickly. On the other hand, an innovation with a small core and large periphery may be easier to adopt, even if it has a lower relative advantage. Additionally, the fuzziness of the boundaries of an innovation can also impact its adoption and diffusion.

Understanding these characteristics is crucial for urban planners and designers, as it allows them to create innovations that are more likely to be adopted and diffused within the community. By involving the community in the design process and considering their needs and preferences, urban revitalization projects can be more successful and sustainable.

In the next section, we will explore the second innovation principle, which focuses on the importance of collaboration and partnerships in urban revitalization. By working together with various stakeholders, urban planners and designers can create more comprehensive and effective solutions for revitalizing urban main streets.





### Section: 19.1b Application of Innovation Principle 1 to Urban Revitalization
