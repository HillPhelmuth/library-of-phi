### Section: 1.4 Backpropagation:

Backpropagation is a fundamental algorithm in deep learning that is used to train artificial neural networks. It is an iterative process that adjusts the weights of the network to minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output. This process is based on the principle of gradient descent, which is a first-order optimization algorithm.

#### 1.4a Chain Rule

The chain rule is a fundamental concept in calculus that is used to find the derivative of a composite function. In the context of deep learning, the chain rule is used to calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network. This is essential for the backpropagation algorithm to adjust the weights and minimize the error.

The chain rule is based on the following identity:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} \left( f(g(x)) \right) = f'(g(x))g'(x)
$$

where $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are differentiable functions. This identity can be extended to multiple layers, resulting in the following equation:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} \left( f(g(h(x))) \right) = f'(g(h(x)))g'(h(x))h'(x)
$$

where $h(x)$ is another differentiable function. This equation can be further generalized to any number of layers, making it a powerful tool for calculating the gradient of a complex function.

In the context of deep learning, the chain rule is used to calculate the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights of the network. This is done by applying the chain rule to the loss function, which is a composite function of the network's output and the desired output. The resulting gradient is then used to adjust the weights of the network, bringing it closer to the desired output.

The chain rule is a crucial concept in deep learning, as it allows for the efficient calculation of the gradient of a complex function. It is also essential for the backpropagation algorithm, as it enables the network to learn from data and make predictions. In the next section, we will explore the backpropagation algorithm in more detail and discuss its applications in deep learning.

### Section: 1.4 Backpropagation:

Backpropagation is a fundamental algorithm in deep learning that is used to train artificial neural networks. It is an iterative process that adjusts the weights of the network to minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output. This process is based on the principle of gradient descent, which is a first-order optimization algorithm.

#### 1.4b Gradient Calculation

The gradient of a function is a vector of partial derivatives that describes the direction of steepest ascent at a given point. In the context of deep learning, the gradient is used to adjust the weights of the network to minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output.

The gradient of a function $f(x)$ with respect to its input $x$ is given by the derivative of $f$ with respect to $x$. In the context of deep learning, the function $f(x)$ is the loss function, which measures the error between the predicted output and the actual output. The input $x$ is the set of weights of the network.

The gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights can be calculated using the chain rule, as discussed in the previous section. This involves calculating the derivative of the loss function with respect to the output of each layer, and then propagating this derivative backwards through the network to the input layer.

The gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights can be used to adjust the weights of the network. This is done by applying the gradient descent algorithm, which iteratively adjusts the weights in the direction of the negative gradient. This process is repeated until the error between the predicted output and the actual output is minimized.

In the next section, we will discuss the backpropagation algorithm in more detail, including how it is used to adjust the weights of the network and minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output.

#### 1.4c Backpropagation Algorithm

The backpropagation algorithm is a gradient-based learning rule that is used to train artificial neural networks. It is an iterative process that adjusts the weights of the network to minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output. This process is based on the principle of gradient descent, which is a first-order optimization algorithm.

The backpropagation algorithm is a special case of the limited-memory BFGS algorithm, which is used to solve nonlinear optimization problems. The backpropagation algorithm is used to solve the optimization problem of minimizing the error between the predicted output and the actual output of a neural network.

The backpropagation algorithm starts with an initial estimate of the optimal value, $\mathbf{x}_0$, and proceeds iteratively to refine that estimate with a sequence of better estimates $\mathbf{x}_1,\mathbf{x}_2,\ldots$. The derivatives of the function $g_k:=\nabla f(\mathbf{x}_k)$ are used as a key driver of the algorithm to identify the direction of steepest descent, and also to form an estimate of the Hessian matrix (second derivative) of $f(\mathbf{x})$.

The backpropagation algorithm shares many features with other quasi-Newton algorithms, but is very different in how the matrix-vector multiplication $d_k=-H_k g_k$ is carried out, where $d_k$ is the approximate Newton's direction, $g_k$ is the current gradient, and $H_k$ is the inverse of the Hessian matrix. There are multiple published approaches using a history of updates to form this direction vector. Here, we give a common approach, the so-called "two loop recursion."

We take as given $x_k$, the position at the `k`-th iteration, and $g_k\equiv\nabla f(x_k)$ where $f$ is the function being minimized, and all vectors are column vectors. We also assume that we have stored the last `m` updates of the form 

We define $\rho_k = \frac{1}{y^{\top}_k s_k}$, and $H^0_k$ will be the 'initial' approximate of the inverse Hessian that our estimate at iteration `k` begins with.

The algorithm is based on the BFGS recursion for the inverse Hessian as

For a fixed `k` we define a sequence of vectors $q_{k-m},\ldots,q_k$ as $q_k:=g_k$ and $q_i:=(I-\rho_i y_i s_i^\top)q_{i+1}$. Then a recursive algorithm for calculating $q_i$ from $q_{i+1}$ is to define $\alpha_i := \rho_i s_i^\top q_{i+1}$ and $q_i=q_{i+1}-\alpha_i y_i$. We also define another sequence of vectors $z_{k-m},\ldots,z_k$ as $z_i:

The backpropagation algorithm is a powerful tool for training neural networks, and it is used in a wide range of applications, from image and speech recognition to natural language processing and robotics. In the next section, we will discuss how the backpropagation algorithm is used to adjust the weights of the network and minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual output.
