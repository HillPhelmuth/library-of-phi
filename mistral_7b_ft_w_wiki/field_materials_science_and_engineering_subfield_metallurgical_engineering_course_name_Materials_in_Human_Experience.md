Ingot formation is a crucial step in the production of copper. It involves the shaping of the molten copper into ingots, which are solid blocks of copper. These ingots are then used for various purposes, such as casting into objects or further refining into pure copper.

#### 3.1a Copper Smelting Process

The process of smelting copper involves heating the crucible charge to a high temperature, typically around 1100°C. This temperature is high enough to melt the copper ore, but low enough to prevent the melting of the fluxes and other additives.

Once the crucible charge is molten, it is stirred to ensure that all the ingredients are evenly mixed. This is important as it helps to distribute the fluxes and other additives throughout the molten copper, aiding in the separation of the metal from the impurities.

After the molten copper is stirred, it is then poured into molds, which are typically made of sand or clay. The molds are carefully designed to ensure that the molten copper is evenly distributed and forms a solid block.

Once the molten copper is poured into the molds, it is left to cool and solidify. This process can take several hours, depending on the size and type of the ingot.

#### 3.1b Ingot Formation Techniques

There are several techniques used for ingot formation, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Some of the most common techniques include:

- Sand casting: This is the most traditional method of ingot formation. It involves pouring the molten copper into a sand mold, which is then compacted to ensure that the molten copper is evenly distributed. The sand acts as a insulator, helping to cool the molten copper and form a solid ingot.

- Permanent mold casting: This technique involves using a reusable mold made of metal or ceramic. The molten copper is poured into the mold, which is then cooled to form the ingot. This method is more efficient than sand casting, but it requires more equipment and is more expensive.

- Continuous casting: This technique involves continuously pouring the molten copper into a mold, which is then slowly pulled out, forming a long ingot. This method is more efficient than the previous two, but it requires specialized equipment and is more expensive.

#### 3.1c Ingot Formation Challenges

Despite the advancements in ingot formation techniques, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed. One of the main challenges is the formation of oxides and other impurities during the smelting process. These impurities can significantly affect the quality of the ingot and the final product.

Another challenge is the control of the temperature and the mixing of the molten copper. Any variations in temperature or uneven mixing can result in impurities being trapped in the ingot, affecting its quality.

Furthermore, the design and maintenance of the molds also pose a challenge. The molds need to be carefully designed to ensure that the molten copper is evenly distributed and forms a solid ingot. They also need to be regularly maintained to prevent any defects or failures.

In conclusion, ingot formation is a crucial step in the production of copper. It involves the shaping of the molten copper into ingots, which are then used for various purposes. Despite the advancements in ingot formation techniques, there are still several challenges that need to be addressed to ensure the production of high-quality copper ingots.

### Introduction

The ancient civilizations of the Andes and Mesoamerica have long been recognized for their advanced metallurgical techniques and artistic designs. In this chapter, we will delve into the specific traditions of sheet metalworking in the Andes and casting in Mesoamerica, and how these techniques were used to create intricate and beautiful objects.

The Andean sheet metal tradition is known for its use of plastic deformation, a process in which metal is shaped by bending, hammering, and other forms of manipulation. This technique was used to create a wide range of objects, from simple tools and utensils to intricate jewelry and religious symbols. The Andean sheet metal tradition is particularly notable for its use of alloying, a process in which two or more metals are combined to create a new metal with unique properties. This allowed the ancient Andean smiths to create objects with specific properties and characteristics, such as strength and durability.

On the other hand, the Mesoamerican casting tradition was based on the use of lost-wax casting, a process in which a wax model of the desired object is covered in a layer of clay, and then heated until the wax melts and is replaced by the molten metal. This technique was used to create a wide range of objects, from simple tools and utensils to intricate jewelry and religious symbols. The Mesoamerican casting tradition is particularly notable for its use of the "cire perdue" (lost-wax) technique, which allowed for the creation of highly detailed and intricate objects.

In this chapter, we will explore the history, techniques, and applications of these two ancient metallurgical traditions, and how they have shaped our understanding of ancient materials and human experience. We will also discuss the ongoing research and advancements in these fields, and how they continue to contribute to our understanding of the ancient world.

The Andean sheet metal tradition, characterized by the use of hammering and anvil, has been traced back to the early Formative period (1800-1000 BC). This tradition has been found to have a strong influence from the Pacific coast, with the earliest evidence of hammered metal objects found in the Ecuadorian and Peruvian coastal regions. The Andean tradition is known for its intricate and detailed designs, often incorporating geometric patterns and animal motifs.

On the other hand, the Central/Mesoamerican casting tradition, which emerged around the same time as the Andean tradition, is characterized by the use of lost-wax casting. This technique involves creating a mold of the desired shape using wax, which is then covered in a layer of clay. The wax is then melted, leaving behind a hollow space that is filled with molten metal. This technique allows for the creation of complex and intricate designs, making it a popular choice for creating jewelry and other ornamental objects.

Both traditions have their own unique characteristics and techniques, but they also share some commonalities. For instance, both traditions utilize plastic deformation, which involves shaping metal by applying pressure and manipulating its form. This technique is particularly useful for creating intricate designs and patterns, as it allows for precise control over the shape and form of the metal.

In conclusion, the Andean sheet metal tradition and the Central/Mesoamerican casting tradition are two distinct but interconnected metallurgy traditions that have shaped the history of ancient metallurgy. Their unique techniques and approaches have left behind a rich legacy of metal objects that continue to fascinate and inspire modern-day researchers and artists.

### Section: 5.1 Color and Planarity: Cultural Significance of Metallic Properties in Andean Cosmology

#### 5.1a Copper-Silver Alloying Process

The process of alloying copper and silver is a complex one, involving careful control of temperature, composition, and technique. The resulting alloy, known as tumbaga, has been a crucial material in Andean cultures for thousands of years.

The process begins with the preparation of a sand mould, a technique that has been used since ancient times. The mould is made from a mixture of sand and water, which is then shaped into the desired form. This could be a simple shape, such as a sphere or a cube, or a more complex design, such as a human figure or an animal.

Once the mould is prepared, the next step is to introduce the metal. In the case of tumbaga, this involves mixing copper and silver in specific proportions. The exact composition of the alloy can vary depending on the desired properties and the specific cultural context. However, a common ratio is approximately 75% copper and 25% silver.

The metal is then introduced into the mould, often through a process known as lost-wax casting. This involves creating a wax model of the desired object, which is then coated in a layer of clay. The wax is then melted, leaving a void in the clay. The metal is then poured into this void, filling the space and taking on the shape of the wax model.

Once the metal has cooled and solidified, the clay is broken away, revealing the finished object. The resulting tumbaga object is a beautiful, golden-colored metal with unique properties. Its color is a result of the combination of copper and silver, with the copper providing a reddish-brown hue and the silver a silvery-white hue. The planarity of the object, or its flatness, is a result of the careful control of the alloying process.

The cultural significance of these metallic properties is profound. The color of tumbaga is associated with the sun and the gods, making it a symbol of power and divinity. Its planarity, meanwhile, is associated with the earth and the underworld, making it a symbol of stability and continuity. These properties have been incorporated into the myths and rituals of Andean cultures, where tumbaga is used in a variety of contexts, from religious offerings to everyday objects.

### Section: 5.1b Preparation of Sand Moulds

The preparation of sand moulds is a crucial step in the process of creating copper-silver alloys. This process involves the careful selection and mixing of sand, the creation of a pattern, and the application of a binder.

#### 5.1b.1 Sand Selection and Mixing

The sand used in the mould is typically a fine, clean sand that is free from impurities. This sand is mixed with a binder, such as water or clay, to create a malleable mixture. The sand to binder ratio can vary depending on the specific requirements of the mould, but a common ratio is approximately 8 parts sand to 1 part binder.

#### 5.1b.2 Creation of a Pattern

A pattern is created from the desired object using wood, metal, or a plastic such as expanded polystyrene. This pattern is then placed in the sand mixture, and the sand is packed around it. The sand is packed in through a vibratory process called ramming, and this process is repeated periodically to ensure that the sand is evenly distributed and compacted.

#### 5.1b.3 Application of a Binder

Once the sand is packed around the pattern, a binder is applied. This binder helps to hold the sand together and create a solid mould. The binder can be water, which is commonly used, or clay, which is more suitable for larger moulds. The binder is applied using a brush or a spray, and the mould is then left to dry.

#### 5.1b.4 Creation of Core Prints

Core prints are created within the mould to create registers for the sand cores. These cores are used to create under-cut profiles and cavities which cannot be molded with the cope and drag. The cores are sometimes reinforced by wires, and they are placed in the mould according to the design of the object.

#### 5.1b.5 Creation of Runner System

The runner system, which includes the sprue, feeders, and in-gates, is created to allow the metal to enter the mould cavity. The sprue is attached to the casting cavity, and the feeders maintain a good metal 'feed'. The in-gates attach the runner system to the casting cavity. Gas and steam generated during casting exit through the permeable sand or via risers, which are added either in the pattern itself, or as separate pieces.

#### 5.1b.6 Creation of Molding Box and Materials

A multi-part molding box (known as a casting flask, the top and bottom halves of which are known respectively as the cope and drag) is prepared to receive the pattern. Molding boxes are made in segments that may be latched to each other and to end closures. For a simple object—flat on one side—the lower portion of the box, closed at the bottom, will be filled with a molding sand. The sand is packed in through a vibratory process called ramming, and in this case, periodically sc
