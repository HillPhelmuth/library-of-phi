### Introduction

Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level. It is a branch of physics that has revolutionized our understanding of the universe and has led to many technological advancements. In this chapter, we will explore the basic features of quantum mechanics, including wave-particle duality, superposition, and entanglement.

Quantum mechanics is a theory that is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, which are the fundamental laws that govern the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level. These principles are based on the concept of wave-particle duality, which states that particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior. This concept was first proposed by Louis de Broglie in 1924 and was later confirmed by experiments, such as the double-slit experiment.

Another important feature of quantum mechanics is superposition, which states that particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This means that a particle can have multiple properties, such as position, momentum, and spin, at the same time. This concept was first proposed by Erwin Schrödinger in 1926 and has been confirmed by experiments, such as the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment.

Entanglement is another phenomenon that is unique to the quantum world. It occurs when two or more particles become connected in such a way that the state of one particle is dependent on the state of the other, even if they are separated by large distances. This phenomenon has been observed in various experiments and has led to the development of quantum technologies, such as quantum cryptography and quantum computing.

In this chapter, we will delve deeper into these concepts and explore their implications in the subatomic world. We will also discuss the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics, including the Schrödinger equation and the wave function. By the end of this chapter, readers will have a solid understanding of the basic features of quantum mechanics and be ready to explore more advanced topics in the following chapters.

## Chapter 1: Basic Features of Quantum Mechanics




### Subsection: 1.1 Linearity of the Equations of Motion

In classical mechanics, the equations of motion are linear, meaning that they can be written in the form:

$$
\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = f(x,t)
$$

where $x$ is the position of the particle and $f(x,t)$ is a function of position and time. This linearity allows us to use techniques such as superposition and variation of parameters to solve these equations.

However, in quantum mechanics, the equations of motion are nonlinear, meaning that they cannot be written in the form above. Instead, they are written in the form:

$$
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(x,t) = \hat{H}\Psi(x,t)
$$

where $\Psi(x,t)$ is the wave function of the particle, $\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator, and $i$ and $\hbar$ are the imaginary unit and reduced Planck's constant, respectively. This nonlinearity is a fundamental difference between classical and quantum mechanics and has profound implications for the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level.

One of the key implications of the nonlinearity of the equations of motion in quantum mechanics is the concept of superposition. As mentioned earlier, superposition states that particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously. This is a direct result of the nonlinearity of the equations of motion, as it allows for the existence of multiple solutions to the Schrödinger equation.

Another important concept in quantum mechanics is entanglement. Entanglement occurs when two or more particles become connected in such a way that the state of one particle is dependent on the state of the other, even if they are separated by large distances. This phenomenon is also a result of the nonlinearity of the equations of motion, as it allows for the existence of non-local correlations between particles.

In the next section, we will explore the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics in more detail, including the Schrödinger equation and the wave function. We will also discuss the implications of the nonlinearity of the equations of motion on the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level.

## Chapter 1:: Basic Features of Quantum Mechanics




### Subsection: 1.2 Complex Numbers are Essential

In classical mechanics, real numbers are sufficient to describe the behavior of particles. However, in quantum mechanics, complex numbers are essential. This is because the wave function, which describes the state of a particle, is a complex-valued function. The complex numbers allow for the description of both the amplitude and phase of the wave function, which is crucial for understanding the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level.

The use of complex numbers in quantum mechanics is not just a mathematical convenience. It has profound physical implications. For example, the concept of superposition, which allows particles to exist in multiple states simultaneously, is a direct result of the complex nature of the wave function. Similarly, the phenomenon of entanglement, where particles become connected in such a way that the state of one particle is dependent on the state of the other, even if they are separated by large distances, is also a result of the complex nature of the wave function.

The use of complex numbers in quantum mechanics also leads to the concept of probability amplitudes. These are complex numbers that represent the probability of a particle being in a particular state. The absolute square of the probability amplitude gives the probability of the particle being in that state. This is a direct consequence of the complex nature of the wave function and the probabilistic interpretation of quantum mechanics.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the mathematical framework of quantum mechanics and explore the concept of the Schrödinger equation, which is the fundamental equation of quantum mechanics. We will also discuss the concept of operators and how they are used to represent physical quantities in quantum mechanics.




### Subsection: 1.3 Loss of Determinism

In classical mechanics, the state of a system at any given time can be precisely determined if its state at an initial time is known. This is a direct consequence of the deterministic nature of classical mechanics. However, in quantum mechanics, the situation is quite different. The loss of determinism is one of the most fundamental and controversial aspects of quantum mechanics.

The loss of determinism in quantum mechanics is often associated with the concept of superposition. As we have seen in the previous section, superposition allows particles to exist in multiple states simultaneously. This is in stark contrast to classical mechanics, where particles are always in a definite state. The concept of superposition leads to the famous Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, which illustrates the non-deterministic nature of quantum mechanics.

In the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, a cat is placed in a box along with a radioactive substance that has a 50% chance of decaying and releasing a poisonous gas. According to quantum mechanics, until the box is opened and observed, the cat exists in a superposition of two states: alive and dead. This is because the decay of the radioactive substance is a probabilistic event, and until observed, the cat is in a state of superposition.

This thought experiment highlights the fundamental difference between classical and quantum mechanics. In classical mechanics, the cat would either be alive or dead, depending on whether the radioactive substance decayed or not. However, in quantum mechanics, the cat can be in both states simultaneously. This is a direct consequence of the loss of determinism in quantum mechanics.

The loss of determinism in quantum mechanics is not limited to the microscopic world. It has profound implications for our understanding of the macroscopic world as well. For example, the concept of quantum entanglement, where particles become connected in such a way that the state of one particle is dependent on the state of the other, even if they are separated by large distances, is a direct consequence of the loss of determinism.

In conclusion, the loss of determinism is one of the most fundamental and controversial aspects of quantum mechanics. It challenges our understanding of causality and the nature of reality. However, it also opens up new possibilities and opportunities, such as quantum computing and quantum cryptography, which we will explore in the following chapters.




### Subsection: 1.4 Quantum Superpositions

Quantum superpositions are a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics. They allow particles to exist in multiple states simultaneously, a concept that is foreign to classical mechanics. This section will delve deeper into the concept of quantum superpositions, exploring their mathematical representation and physical implications.

#### 1.4a Mathematical Representation of Superpositions

In quantum mechanics, the state of a particle is represented by a wave function, denoted as $\Psi(x,t)$. This wave function contains all the information about the particle, including its position, momentum, and energy. The wave function is a solution to the Schrödinger equation, which is a linear differential equation. This linearity allows for the superposition of wave functions, leading to the concept of quantum superpositions.

Mathematically, a quantum superposition can be represented as:

$$
\Psi(x,t) = A\Psi_1(x,t) + B\Psi_2(x,t)
$$

where $A$ and $B$ are complex coefficients, and $\Psi_1(x,t)$ and $\Psi_2(x,t)$ are two distinct wave functions. This equation represents a particle in a superposition of two states, represented by the wave functions $\Psi_1(x,t)$ and $\Psi_2(x,t)$.

The concept of superposition is not limited to two states. In fact, any number of states can be superposed. This leads to the concept of quantum states being represented as vectors in a complex vector space, with the coefficients of the superposition representing the probabilities of the particle being in each state.

#### 1.4b Physical Implications of Superpositions

The concept of quantum superpositions has profound implications for our understanding of the physical world. It leads to phenomena such as quantum entanglement, where particles become connected in such a way that the state of one particle is dependent on the state of the other, even when they are separated by large distances.

Superpositions also lead to the concept of quantum interference, where the probability of finding a particle in a particular state is influenced by the superposition of other states. This is analogous to the interference patterns observed in classical wave phenomena, such as light passing through two slits.

In the next section, we will explore these phenomena in more detail, and discuss their implications for our understanding of the quantum world.

#### 1.4b Interference and Superposition

Quantum interference is a direct consequence of quantum superpositions. It is a phenomenon where the probability of finding a particle in a particular state is influenced by the superposition of other states. This is analogous to the interference patterns observed in classical wave phenomena, such as light passing through two slits.

Mathematically, the interference of two wave functions $\Psi_1(x,t)$ and $\Psi_2(x,t)$ can be represented as:

$$
\Psi(x,t) = A\Psi_1(x,t) + B\Psi_2(x,t)
$$

where $A$ and $B$ are complex coefficients, and $\Psi_1(x,t)$ and $\Psi_2(x,t)$ are two distinct wave functions. The probability density of finding the particle in a particular state is given by $|\Psi(x,t)|^2$.

The interference pattern is then given by the square of the absolute value of the superposition, $|\Psi(x,t)|^2$. This can result in constructive or destructive interference, depending on whether the superposition is in phase or out of phase.

In the context of quantum computing, superpositions and interference play a crucial role. Quantum bits, or qubits, can exist in a superposition of states, allowing quantum computers to process vast amounts of information simultaneously. This is in contrast to classical computers, which can only process one bit of information at a time.

The concept of superposition also allows for quantum error correction, a technique used to protect quantum information from errors caused by noise and other disturbances. Quantum error correction is based on the principle of quantum redundancy, where quantum information is encoded in multiple qubits, allowing for the detection and correction of errors.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the concept of quantum entanglement, another phenomenon that is a direct consequence of quantum superpositions.

#### 1.4c Superposition and Probability

Quantum superpositions are not just mathematical constructs, but have physical implications that can be observed in experiments. One of these implications is the concept of probability. In quantum mechanics, the probability of finding a particle in a particular state is given by the square of the absolute value of the wave function, $|\Psi(x,t)|^2$.

This probability is not a fixed value, but can change over time due to the superposition of other states. This is in stark contrast to classical mechanics, where the state of a system can be precisely determined if its state at an initial time is known.

The concept of probability in quantum mechanics is often a source of confusion for those new to the field. It is important to note that this probability is not a measure of our uncertainty about the state of the particle. Rather, it is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics that describes the inherent uncertainty in the state of a particle.

The concept of probability in quantum mechanics is also closely tied to the concept of measurement. In quantum mechanics, a measurement is not just an observation, but a physical interaction that can change the state of the system. This is known as the measurement problem, and is one of the most debated topics in quantum mechanics.

The measurement problem can be illustrated by the famous Schrödinger's cat thought experiment. In this thought experiment, a cat is placed in a box along with a radioactive substance that has a 50% chance of decaying and releasing a poisonous gas. According to quantum mechanics, until the box is opened and observed, the cat exists in a superposition of two states: alive and dead. This is because the decay of the radioactive substance is a probabilistic event, and until observed, the cat is in a state of superposition.

This thought experiment highlights the fundamental difference between classical and quantum mechanics. In classical mechanics, the cat would either be alive or dead, depending on whether the radioactive substance decayed or not. However, in quantum mechanics, the cat can be in both states simultaneously. This is a direct consequence of the concept of superposition and the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of quantum entanglement, another phenomenon that is a direct consequence of quantum superpositions.

### Conclusion

In this chapter, we have explored the basic features of quantum mechanics, delving into the subatomic world and uncovering the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of particles at the quantum level. We have learned that quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the behavior of particles at the atomic and subatomic level. It is a theory that describes the physical phenomena at the nanoscopic scales, where the action is on the order of the Planck constant.

We have also discovered that quantum mechanics is a probabilistic theory, unlike classical mechanics which is deterministic. This probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics is a key feature that distinguishes it from classical mechanics. We have also learned about the wave-particle duality of matter, which is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics. This duality suggests that particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.

Furthermore, we have explored the concept of superposition, which is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics. Superposition allows particles to exist in multiple states simultaneously, until observed. This concept is often associated with the famous Schrödinger's cat thought experiment.

Finally, we have touched upon the concept of quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where particles become connected in such a way that the state of one particle is dependent on the state of the other, even when they are separated by large distances. This concept has profound implications for quantum computing and communication.

In conclusion, quantum mechanics is a fascinating and complex field that continues to challenge our understanding of the physical world. As we delve deeper into this field, we will continue to uncover more of its intriguing features and implications.

## Chapter: Quantum Mechanics of a Particle in a Box

### Introduction

In the realm of quantum mechanics, the concept of a particle in a box is a fundamental one. It is a simple yet powerful model that provides a basis for understanding more complex quantum systems. This chapter will delve into the quantum mechanics of a particle in a box, exploring the principles and phenomena that govern its behavior.

The particle in a box is a hypothetical particle confined to a one-dimensional box. The box is assumed to be infinitely high and deep, but finite in width. This model is often used to represent particles confined to a small region of space, such as electrons in atoms or molecules.

In classical mechanics, the behavior of a particle in a box is straightforward. The particle is confined to the box and its energy is quantized, meaning it can only have certain discrete values. However, in quantum mechanics, the behavior of the particle in a box is governed by the Schrödinger equation, which allows for a more complex and interesting set of possibilities.

In this chapter, we will explore the solutions to the Schrödinger equation for a particle in a box. These solutions, known as wavefunctions, describe the probability of finding the particle at a particular location within the box. We will also discuss the concept of energy levels and how they are determined by the quantum mechanical properties of the particle.

The quantum mechanics of a particle in a box is a cornerstone of quantum physics. It provides a foundation for understanding more complex quantum systems, such as atoms, molecules, and solids. By exploring the quantum mechanics of a particle in a box, we can gain a deeper understanding of the quantum world and its fundamental principles.




### Subsection: 1.5 Entanglement

Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon where two or more particles become connected in such a way that the state of one particle is dependent on the state of the other, even when they are separated by large distances. This concept was first introduced by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen in their famous EPR paradox paper in 1935.

#### 1.5a EPR Paradox

The EPR paradox is a thought experiment that Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen proposed to demonstrate the incompleteness of quantum mechanics. They argued that if two particles are entangled, the state of one particle can be determined by measuring the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them. This, they argued, violated the speed limit of light as predicted by special relativity.

The EPR paradox can be illustrated using the example of two entangled particles, A and B. If particles A and B are entangled, the state of particle A is dependent on the state of particle B, even when they are separated by large distances. If we measure the state of particle A, we can determine the state of particle B, even though we are not directly measuring particle B. This, according to Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen, violated the principle of locality, which states that an object can only be influenced by its immediate surroundings.

However, the EPR paradox was later resolved by John Stewart Bell in his 1964 paper, "On the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Paradox". Bell showed that the EPR paradox could be resolved by introducing the concept of quantum non-locality, which allows for the non-local influence of one particle on another. This concept is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics and has been experimentally verified.

The EPR paradox and the concept of quantum entanglement have profound implications for our understanding of the physical world. They challenge our classical understanding of causality and locality, and open up new possibilities for quantum technologies such as quantum computing and quantum cryptography.

#### 1.5b Quantum Non-locality

Quantum non-locality is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics that allows for the non-local influence of one particle on another. This concept was first introduced by John Stewart Bell in his 1964 paper, "On the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Paradox". Bell showed that the EPR paradox could be resolved by introducing the concept of quantum non-locality, which allows for the non-local influence of one particle on another.

The concept of quantum non-locality is often illustrated using the example of two entangled particles, A and B. If particles A and B are entangled, the state of particle A is dependent on the state of particle B, even when they are separated by large distances. This non-local influence is not a violation of the speed limit of light, as predicted by special relativity. Instead, it is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics that challenges our classical understanding of causality and locality.

Quantum non-locality has been experimentally verified in numerous experiments, including the famous Bell test experiments. These experiments have shown that the predictions of quantum mechanics, including the concept of quantum non-locality, are in agreement with experimental observations.

The concept of quantum non-locality has profound implications for our understanding of the physical world. It challenges our classical understanding of causality and locality, and opens up new possibilities for quantum technologies such as quantum computing and quantum cryptography.

#### 1.5c Bell Test Experiments

The Bell test experiments are a series of experiments designed to test the predictions of quantum mechanics, including the concept of quantum non-locality. These experiments are based on the Bell inequality, a mathematical inequality proposed by John Stewart Bell in his 1964 paper. The Bell inequality is a prediction of quantum mechanics that can be tested experimentally.

The Bell inequality is based on the concept of quantum non-locality. According to the Bell inequality, if two particles are entangled, the state of one particle can be determined by measuring the state of the other, even when they are separated by large distances. This prediction is a direct consequence of the concept of quantum non-locality.

The Bell test experiments have been performed numerous times since the 1960s, and have consistently shown that the predictions of quantum mechanics, including the Bell inequality, are in agreement with experimental observations. These experiments have provided strong evidence for the validity of quantum mechanics, and have helped to establish the concept of quantum non-locality as a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics.

The Bell test experiments have also been used to test the predictions of other theories of quantum mechanics, such as the hidden variable theories proposed by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen in their famous EPR paradox paper. These tests have shown that these theories are incompatible with the predictions of quantum mechanics, and have helped to establish the concept of quantum non-locality as a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics.

The Bell test experiments have profound implications for our understanding of the physical world. They challenge our classical understanding of causality and locality, and open up new possibilities for quantum technologies such as quantum computing and quantum cryptography.

### Introduction

In the previous chapter, we introduced the concept of quantum mechanics and its fundamental principles. We explored the wave-particle duality of matter and the probabilistic nature of quantum phenomena. In this chapter, we will delve deeper into the world of quantum mechanics by examining the behavior of photons, the fundamental particles of light.

Photons are unique in that they are massless and travel at the speed of light. Their behavior is governed by the principles of quantum mechanics, making them a crucial component in understanding the quantum world. In this chapter, we will explore various experiments with photons that have led to groundbreaking discoveries and have shaped our understanding of the quantum world.

We will begin by discussing the photoelectric effect, a phenomenon that was first observed by Heinrich Hertz in the late 19th century. This effect demonstrated the particle-like behavior of light and paved the way for the development of quantum mechanics. We will then move on to explore the Compton scattering experiment, which provided evidence for the wave-like behavior of light.

Next, we will delve into the concept of quantum entanglement, a phenomenon that Albert Einstein famously referred to as "spooky action at a distance." We will also discuss the EPR paradox, a thought experiment that challenged our understanding of causality and led to the development of quantum mechanics.

Finally, we will explore the concept of quantum superposition, a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics that allows particles to exist in multiple states simultaneously. We will discuss the famous double-slit experiment and its implications for our understanding of the quantum world.

By the end of this chapter, we will have a deeper understanding of the behavior of photons and how they are governed by the principles of quantum mechanics. This will provide a solid foundation for our exploration of the subatomic world in the following chapters. So let us begin our journey into the fascinating world of quantum mechanics and explore the behavior of photons.

### Subsection: 2.1 Mach-Zehnder Interferometer

The Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) is a fundamental tool in quantum mechanics that allows us to explore the concepts of superposition and interference. It is a simplified version of the double-slit experiment, but it has its own unique applications, such as the delayed choice quantum eraser and the Elitzur-Vaidman bomb tester. The MZI also plays a crucial role in the study of quantum entanglement.

To understand the behavior of a photon passing through the MZI, we can model it as a vector $\psi \in \mathbb{C}^2$ that is a superposition of two paths: the "lower" path $\psi_l = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ and the "upper" path $\psi_u = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$. This means that the photon can exist in both paths simultaneously, with complex coefficients $\alpha$ and $\beta$ representing the probability amplitudes for each path. The postulate that the total probability of the photon's state is 1 requires that $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$.

The MZI consists of two beam splitters, which are modelled as the unitary matrix $B = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix} 1 & i \\ i & 1 \end{pmatrix}$. When a photon enters the MZI, it is split into two paths, with one path passing through the upper beam splitter and the other through the lower beam splitter. The two paths then recombine at the second beam splitter, where they interfere with each other.

The phase shifter on the upper arm is modelled as the unitary matrix $P = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & e^{i\Delta\Phi} \end{pmatrix}$, which means that if the photon is on the "upper" path, it will gain a relative phase of $e^{i\Delta\Phi}$, while the "lower" path will remain unchanged. This phase difference can be controlled by adjusting the distance between the two beam splitters, allowing us to manipulate the interference pattern.

The MZI has been used in various experiments to demonstrate the principles of quantum mechanics. For example, in the delayed choice quantum eraser experiment, the MZI is used to erase the interference pattern created by the photon, allowing us to observe the wave-particle duality of light. In the Elitzur-Vaidman bomb tester, the MZI is used to test the concept of quantum non-disturbance, where the measurement of a system does not affect its state.

In conclusion, the Mach-Zehnder interferometer is a powerful tool in quantum mechanics that allows us to explore the concepts of superposition and interference. Its applications in various experiments have greatly contributed to our understanding of the quantum world.
