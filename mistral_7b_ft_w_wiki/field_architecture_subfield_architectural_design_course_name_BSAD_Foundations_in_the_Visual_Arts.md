### Section 1.1 Made Public:

Public art is a form of visual art that is created with the intention of being displayed in a public space, such as a park, street, or building. It is a way for artists to engage with the community and create a dialogue between the artwork and the public. Public art can take many forms, including sculptures, murals, installations, and performances.

#### 1.1a Understanding Public Art

Public art is a powerful tool for artists to communicate their ideas and messages to a wider audience. It allows for a direct interaction between the artist and the public, breaking down the barriers of elitism often associated with the art world. Public art also has the ability to transform a public space, creating a sense of place and identity for the community.

One of the key aspects of public art is its accessibility. Unlike private art, which is often confined to galleries and museums, public art is available for everyone to see and experience. This allows for a more diverse audience to engage with the artwork, breaking down barriers of class, race, and education. Public art also has the potential to challenge and provoke, sparking important conversations and debates within the community.

Public art also plays a crucial role in the urban landscape. As cities continue to grow and evolve, public art can help to create a sense of place and identity for the community. It can also serve functional purposes, such as erosion control or creating public spaces. For example, in 1982, Herbert Bayer used public art to create a 2.5 acre park in Mill Creek Canyon, serving as a reservoir during high rain periods and a park during dry seasons.

Public art also has the power to bring nature back into the urban environment. In 1965, Alan Sonfist introduced the idea of creating a "Time Landscape" in New York City, a slowly developing forest that represents the Manhattan landscape inhabited by Native Americans and encountered by Dutch settlers in the early 17th century. This work, now visible to the public, serves as a reminder of the natural history of the city.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of public art and how they are used to engage with the community. We will also discuss the challenges and opportunities of creating public art in today's society.





### Section 1.1b Role of Public Art

Public art plays a crucial role in shaping the visual landscape of a city or community. It serves as a platform for artists to engage with the public and communicate their ideas and messages. Public art also has the power to transform a public space, creating a sense of place and identity for the community.

One of the key roles of public art is its ability to challenge and provoke. Public art can spark important conversations and debates within the community, challenging the status quo and encouraging critical thinking. This is especially important in a diverse and complex society, where public art can serve as a tool for social commentary and critique.

Public art also plays a crucial role in the urban landscape. As cities continue to grow and evolve, public art can help to create a sense of place and identity for the community. It can also serve functional purposes, such as erosion control or creating public spaces. For example, in 1982, Herbert Bayer used public art to create a 2.5 acre park in Mill Creek Canyon, serving as a reservoir during high rain periods and a park during dry seasons.

Public art also has the power to bring nature back into the urban environment. In 1965, Alan Sonfist introduced the idea of creating a "Time Landscape" in New York City, a slowly developing forest that represents the Manhattan landscape inhabited by Native Americans and encountered by Dutch settlers in the early 17th century. This work, known as "Time Landscape," remains visible to this day and serves as a reminder of the natural history of the city.

In addition to its role in shaping the visual landscape and sparking important conversations, public art also has the power to bring people together. Public art can serve as a gathering place for the community, providing a space for people to connect and engage with each other. This is especially important in today's digital age, where people often spend more time online than in physical spaces.

Overall, public art plays a crucial role in shaping the visual landscape of a city or community. It serves as a platform for artists to communicate their ideas and messages, challenges the status quo, and brings people together. As we continue to develop and evolve as a society, public art will play an increasingly important role in shaping our cities and communities.





### Subsection 1.1c Public Art in Contemporary Society

Public art in contemporary society has evolved significantly from its traditional forms. With the rise of technology and digital media, public art has become more interactive and immersive, blurring the lines between art and life. This has led to a shift in the role and purpose of public art, as it now serves as a platform for artists to engage with the public in new and innovative ways.

One of the most significant developments in public art is the use of digital media. Digital art, also known as electronic or computer art, has become increasingly prevalent in public spaces. This form of art utilizes technology as an essential part of the creative process, allowing for a more dynamic and interactive experience for the audience. Digital art can take many forms, from interactive installations to virtual reality experiences, and has the potential to transform public spaces in ways that traditional art forms cannot.

Another important aspect of public art in contemporary society is its role in addressing social and political issues. With the rise of social media and the 24-hour news cycle, public art has become a powerful tool for artists to comment on and critique current events. This has led to the emergence of street art and graffiti as popular forms of public art, which allow artists to express their views and opinions in a direct and visible way.

Public art also plays a crucial role in shaping the identity of a community. In today's globalized world, where people are constantly moving and interacting with different cultures, public art can serve as a symbol of identity and belonging. By showcasing the unique history and culture of a community, public art can create a sense of pride and unity among its members.

However, the role of public art in contemporary society is not without its challenges. With the increasing commercialization of public spaces, there have been concerns about the commodification of public art. This has led to debates about the ownership and control of public art, as well as the potential loss of its authenticity and meaning.

In conclusion, public art in contemporary society has undergone a significant transformation, reflecting the changing values and needs of our society.

## Chapter 1: Introduction to the Course and the First Assignment:




### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the concept of private and public spaces in the context of the visual arts. Private spaces refer to the personal, intimate, and often hidden areas of our lives, while public spaces are the more visible and accessible parts of our environment. These spaces are not just physical entities, but also social constructs that shape our interactions and experiences.

The visual arts, including painting, sculpture, and photography, have long been used to represent and interpret these spaces. Artists have been fascinated by the interplay between the private and public, the visible and invisible, the tangible and intangible. They have used these spaces as a canvas to explore themes of identity, privacy, and social interaction.

We will delve into the ways in which artists have depicted private and public spaces, and how these representations have evolved over time. We will also examine the role of these spaces in our daily lives, and how they are shaped by cultural, social, and political factors.

This chapter aims to provide a comprehensive guide to understanding private and public spaces in the visual arts. It will offer insights into the ways in which these spaces are represented, interpreted, and experienced, and how they reflect and shape our world. Whether you are a student, a scholar, or simply a lover of the visual arts, this chapter will offer you a deeper understanding of these fundamental concepts.




### Section: 2.1 Bring to Class an Exhaustive List of Private & Public Spaces:

#### 2.1a Identifying Private Spaces

Private spaces are the areas of our lives that are not accessible to the general public. They are often associated with intimacy, privacy, and personal identity. These spaces can be physical, such as our homes, bedrooms, and personal possessions, or they can be psychological, such as our thoughts, feelings, and memories.

In the context of the visual arts, private spaces are often represented as hidden, enclosed, or intimate spaces. For example, a bedroom in a painting or a close-up of a character's face in a photograph can represent the private space of an individual. These representations can reveal the artist's perception of the private self and the social and cultural values associated with it.

However, it is important to note that private spaces are not always physical or tangible. They can also be abstract, such as the space of our minds or the space of our relationships. For instance, a character's thoughts or a couple's shared space can be represented as private spaces in a visual artwork.

In the next section, we will explore the concept of public spaces and how they interact with private spaces in the visual arts.

#### 2.1b Identifying Public Spaces

Public spaces, on the other hand, are the areas of our lives that are accessible to the general public. They are often associated with social interaction, public life, and shared experiences. These spaces can be physical, such as public parks, streets, and squares, or they can be virtual, such as online forums and social media platforms.

In the visual arts, public spaces are often represented as open, accessible, or communal spaces. For example, a public park in a painting or a street scene in a photograph can represent the public space of a community. These representations can reveal the artist's perception of the public self and the social and cultural values associated with it.

However, it is important to note that public spaces are not always physical or tangible. They can also be abstract, such as the space of our communities or the space of our interactions. For instance, a community gathering or an online discussion can be represented as a public space in a visual artwork.

In the next section, we will explore the relationship between private and public spaces in the visual arts, and how they shape our understanding of the self and society.

#### 2.1c Case Studies of Private & Public Spaces

To further illustrate the concepts of private and public spaces in the visual arts, let's examine some case studies.

##### Private Spaces

In the painting "The Bedroom" by Vincent van Gogh, the bedroom is depicted as a private space. The room is enclosed, with only a small window providing light. The bed, a symbol of privacy and intimacy, is the focal point of the room. The painting suggests a sense of isolation and introspection, reflecting van Gogh's own experiences of loneliness and mental turmoil.

In the photograph "Girl with a Pearl Earring" by Johannes Vermeer, the girl's face is depicted as a private space. The girl's gaze is directed inward, suggesting a world of thoughts and feelings that are not accessible to the viewer. The pearl earring, a symbol of beauty and femininity, adds to the sense of intimacy and privacy.

##### Public Spaces

In the painting "The Square" by Piet Mondrian, the square is depicted as a public space. The square is open and accessible, with no enclosing walls or boundaries. The grid-like structure of the square suggests a sense of order and public life. The painting reflects Mondrian's interest in urban spaces and his belief in the social and cultural values of abstraction.

In the photograph "The Kiss" by Alfred Eisenstaedt, the kiss is depicted as a public space. The kiss is captured in a public setting, suggesting a shared experience and social interaction. The couple's embrace creates a sense of intimacy and privacy within the public space. The photograph reflects Eisenstaedt's interest in capturing spontaneous moments of human interaction.

These case studies illustrate how private and public spaces are represented in the visual arts. They also highlight the complex interplay between the private and public, the intimate and the communal, in our lives.




#### 2.1b Identifying Public Spaces

Public spaces are not always physical or tangible. They can also be abstract, such as the space of our minds or the space of our relationships. For instance, a character's thoughts or a couple's shared space can be represented as public spaces in a visual artwork.

In the context of the visual arts, public spaces are often represented as open, accessible, or communal spaces. For example, a public park in a painting or a street scene in a photograph can represent the public space of a community. These representations can reveal the artist's perception of the public self and the social and cultural values associated with it.

However, it is important to note that public spaces are not always physical or tangible. They can also be virtual, such as online forums and social media platforms. These virtual public spaces have become increasingly important in our lives, especially in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, where physical public spaces have been limited or restricted.

In the next section, we will explore the relationship between private and public spaces in the visual arts, and how artists represent and explore these spaces in their work.

#### 2.1c Case Studies of Private & Public Spaces

In this section, we will delve into specific examples of private and public spaces in the visual arts. These case studies will provide a deeper understanding of how artists represent and explore these spaces in their work.

##### Private Spaces

###### Case Study 1: The Bedroom in "Girl with a Pearl Earring"

The bedroom in the painting "Girl with a Pearl Earring" by Johannes Vermeer is a prime example of a private space in the visual arts. The girl's bedroom is depicted as a small, intimate space, with a simple bed, a table, and a window. The girl's face, partially obscured by her hand, suggests a sense of privacy and intimacy. The use of light and shadow in the painting further emphasizes the private nature of this space.

This painting is often interpreted as a symbol of the girl's inner world, her thoughts and feelings. The bedroom, therefore, represents a private space not just physically, but also psychologically. It is a space where the girl can retreat and be alone with her thoughts.

###### Case Study 2: The Kitchen in "The Supper at Emmaus"

The kitchen in the painting "The Supper at Emmaus" by Caravaggio is another example of a private space. The kitchen is depicted as a small, enclosed space, with a table, a bench, and a fireplace. The two figures, one of whom is Jesus, are engaged in a private conversation. The use of light and shadow in the painting further emphasizes the private nature of this space.

This painting is often interpreted as a symbol of the private moment shared by Jesus and his disciples. The kitchen, therefore, represents a private space not just physically, but also spiritually. It is a space where Jesus can reveal his true identity to his disciples.

##### Public Spaces

###### Case Study 3: The Street in "The Scream"

The street in the painting "The Scream" by Edvard Munch is a prime example of a public space in the visual arts. The street is depicted as a wide, open space, with buildings on either side. The figure in the painting, his hands over his ears, is surrounded by a sense of chaos and noise. The use of color and line in the painting further emphasizes the public nature of this space.

This painting is often interpreted as a symbol of the artist's inner turmoil, his feelings of anxiety and fear. The street, therefore, represents a public space not just physically, but also psychologically. It is a space where the artist can express his inner feelings and emotions.

###### Case Study 4: The Park in "The Kiss"

The park in the painting "The Kiss" by Gustav Klimt is another example of a public space. The park is depicted as a large, open space, with trees, benches, and a path. The two figures, one of whom is a woman in a long dress, are engaged in a private moment in a public space. The use of color and line in the painting further emphasizes the public nature of this space.

This painting is often interpreted as a symbol of the public display of affection. The park, therefore, represents a public space not just physically, but also socially. It is a space where the couple can express their love and affection in a public setting.

In the next section, we will explore the relationship between private and public spaces in the visual arts, and how artists represent and explore these spaces in their work.




#### 2.1c The Interplay Between Private and Public Spaces

The interplay between private and public spaces in the visual arts is a complex and multifaceted topic. It involves an exploration of how artists represent and explore these spaces in their work, and how these representations reflect societal values and cultural norms.

##### Private Spaces

Private spaces in the visual arts are often depicted as intimate, personal, and often hidden from view. These spaces are often represented as places of solitude, introspection, and privacy. For instance, in the painting "Girl with a Pearl Earring", the girl's bedroom is depicted as a small, intimate space, with a simple bed, a table, and a window. The girl's face, partially obscured by her hand, suggests a sense of privacy and intimacy. The use of light and shadow in the painting further emphasizes the private nature of this space.

##### Public Spaces

Public spaces in the visual arts, on the other hand, are often depicted as open, accessible, and communal. These spaces are often represented as places of interaction, socialization, and public life. For instance, in the painting "The Market", the marketplace is depicted as a bustling, communal space, with people interacting, trading goods, and going about their daily lives. The use of color and composition in the painting further emphasizes the public nature of this space.

##### The Interplay

The interplay between private and public spaces in the visual arts is a reflection of the larger societal and cultural dynamics. Private spaces are often depicted as places of introspection and privacy, reflecting the value placed on individualism and personal space in modern society. Public spaces, on the other hand, are often depicted as places of interaction and socialization, reflecting the value placed on community and public life.

However, the interplay between private and public spaces is not always straightforward. For instance, in the painting "The Market", the marketplace is depicted as a public space, but it also includes elements of privacy, such as the woman selling her wares. This suggests a complex interplay between private and public spaces, where the private and the public are not always distinct and separate.

In conclusion, the interplay between private and public spaces in the visual arts is a complex and multifaceted topic. It involves an exploration of how artists represent and explore these spaces in their work, and how these representations reflect societal values and cultural norms.




#### 2.2a Introduction to Public Art

Public art is a form of visual art that is intended to be experienced in a public space, such as a park, a street, or a building. It is a powerful tool for engaging the public, stimulating dialogue, and creating a sense of place. Public art can take many forms, from large-scale sculptures and murals to temporary installations and performance art.

##### The Role of Public Art in Urban Landscape

Public art plays a crucial role in the urban landscape. It serves as a platform for artists to engage with the public and explore ideas and concepts about the environment. As Lucy Lippard noted in her groundbreaking book, contemporary land art and prehistoric sites share a parallel in the way they "overlay" onto the work of artists working with the land and natural systems. This idea of overlaying is evident in the works of artists like Robert Morris and Herbert Bayer, who used public spaces as a platform to create works that served multiple functions, such as erosion control and reservoirs.

##### The Interplay of Private and Public Spaces in Public Art

The interplay between private and public spaces is a key aspect of public art. Public art often explores the tension between these two spaces, reflecting the complexities of modern life. For instance, Alan Sonfist's "Time Landscape" is a prime example of this interplay. The work, which remains visible to this day, represents the Manhattan landscape inhabited by Native Americans and encountered by Dutch settlers in the early 17th century. The work is a slow-developing forest that serves as a reminder of the private, natural spaces that once existed in the public urban landscape.

##### The Impact of Public Art on the Public

Public art has a profound impact on the public. It can transform a public space, creating a sense of place and fostering a sense of community. It can also stimulate dialogue and engagement, as seen in the works of Mary Miss, who has been creating art in the urban environment since 1969. Her projects, such as "Ropes/Shore," continue to explore the interplay between private and public spaces, engaging the public in a dialogue about the urban landscape.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the world of public art, exploring the various forms it takes, the artists who create it, and the impact it has on the public.

#### 2.2b Public Art and Urban Planning

Public art and urban planning are two interconnected disciplines that shape the visual landscape of our cities. Urban planning, as defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, is the process of designing and managing land use and the built environment.

### Coats

Plasters are applied in successive coats or layers on walls or lathing and gains its name from the number of these coats.

The process for three coat work is as follows:

The composition of an interior three coat plaster:

The hard cements used for plastering, such as Parian, Keene's, and Martin's, are laid generally in two coats, the first of cement and sand 1/2 to 3/4 inches thick, the second or setting coat of neat cement about 1/8 inch thick. These and similar cements have gypsum as a base, to which a certain proportion of another substance, such as alum, borax or carbonate of soda, is added, and the whole baked or calcined at a low temperature. The plaster they contain causes them to set quickly with a very hard smooth surface, which may be painted or papered within a few hours of its being finished.

In Australia, plaster or cement render that is applied to external brickwork on dwellings or commercial buildings can be one or two coats. In two coat render a base coat is applied with a common mix of 4 parts sand to one part cement and one part dehydrated lime and water to make a consistent mortar. Render is applied using a hawk and trowel and pushed on about 12 mm thick to begin. For two coat, some plasterers apply two full depth bands of render (one at the base of the wall and one around chest height) which are screeded plumb and square and allowed to dry while applying the first coat over the remaining exposed wall. The render is then scratched to provide a key for the second coat. This method allows the rest of the wall to be rendered and screeded off without the need to continually check if the second coat is plumb. Alternatively, both coats can be

#### 6.2c Reviewing and Revising the Statement of Intent

After writing the Statement of Intent, it is important to review and revise it. This process is crucial for ensuring that the Statement of Intent accurately reflects the artist's vision and goals for the project. It also allows the artist to refine their ideas and concepts, and to make any necessary adjustments.

The review and revision process can be broken down into several steps:

1. **Read the Statement of Intent**: The first step in the review process is to read the Statement of Intent. This may seem obvious, but it is important to read the Statement of Intent carefully, paying attention to the details and nuances of the project.

2. **Identify Areas for Improvement**: As the artist reads the Statement of Intent, they should identify areas where the Statement could be improved. This could include clarifying certain points, expanding on ideas, or correcting any errors.

3. **Make Revisions**: Based on the areas identified for improvement, the artist should make revisions to the Statement of Intent. This could involve rewriting certain sections, adding new information, or making other changes as needed.

4. **Review the Revised Statement**: After making revisions, the artist should review the revised Statement of Intent. This allows them to ensure that the revisions have improved the Statement and that it still accurately reflects their vision and goals for the project.

5. **Finalize the Statement**: Once the artist is satisfied with the revised Statement of Intent, they should finalize it. This involves making any final edits, proofreading the Statement, and ensuring that it is well-organized and coherent.

The review and revision process is an iterative one. Artists may need to repeat this process multiple times before they are satisfied with their Statement of Intent. However, the time and effort invested in this process can greatly enhance the quality of the Statement and the project as a whole.




#### 6.3a Developing a Strategy for Action

After the Statement of Intent has been reviewed and revised, the next step is to develop a strategy for action. This involves setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals, and identifying the resources and actions needed to achieve these goals.

The strategy for action can be developed through a process of planning, organizing, and prioritizing. This process involves:

1. **Setting SMART Goals**: The first step in developing a strategy for action is to set SMART goals. These are goals that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. For example, a SMART goal could be: "To create a visual art project that explores the theme of identity, using a variety of mediums, by the end of the semester."

2. **Identifying Resources**: Once the goals have been set, the next step is to identify the resources needed to achieve these goals. This could include materials, equipment, time, and human resources. For example, if the goal is to create a visual art project, the resources needed could include art supplies, a workspace, and time to work on the project.

3. **Planning Actions**: After the resources have been identified, the next step is to plan the actions needed to achieve the goals.

In addition, it helps instructors clearly identify the main points of a topic or activity while still providing the details through presentation (Loisel & Galer, 2004). Instructors can incorporate multiple types of media formats (e.g., diagram, photo, drawing, sound and video) that cannot be easily integrated together into one single medium. PowerPoint also provides graphical, transactional, aesthetic and interactive features. PowerPoint is for use in the classroom, and needs to be paired with use of an LCD projector and large screen.

## The role of the instructor

In order to be successful, an instructor needs to guide the audience through the presentation, keep their interest, and attract their attention (Chiasson & Gutwin, 2005). This can be achieved through effective use of visual aids, engaging delivery, and interactive elements. The instructor also plays a crucial role in ensuring that the presentation is well-organized and coherent, and that the main points are effectively conveyed to the audience.

### Subsection: 7.1b Delivering a Student Presentation

Delivering a student presentation can be a daunting task, but with proper preparation and practice, it can be a rewarding experience. Here are some tips for delivering a successful student presentation:

Confidence and enthusiasm are key to delivering a successful presentation. Speak clearly and confidently, and let your passion for the topic shine through. Your audience will feed off your energy and enthusiasm, making your presentation more engaging and memorable.

#### Time Management

Time management is essential for a successful presentation. Make sure you have enough time to cover all the main points and avoid rushing through important information. It is also important to leave time for questions and discussion at the end of your presentation.

#### Seek Feedback

Don't be afraid to seek feedback from your peers or instructors. They can provide valuable insights and suggestions for improvement. Use this feedback to refine your presentation and become a more effective presenter.

In conclusion, delivering a student presentation can be a challenging but rewarding experience.

Feedback is an essential part of the learning process. It allows students to understand their strengths and weaknesses, and provides a roadmap for improvement. In the context of student presentations, feedback can be a powerful tool for enhancing communication skills and understanding of the material.

#### The Importance of Feedback

Feedback is crucial for students as it helps them understand how their presentation was perceived by the audience. It provides an opportunity for students to reflect on their performance and identify areas for improvement. Feedback also allows instructors to assess the effectiveness of their teaching methods and adjust accordingly.

#### Types of Feedback

Feedback can be categorized into two types: formative and summative. Formative feedback is given during the presentation, while summative feedback is provided after the presentation. Formative feedback is more immediate and can be used to guide the presentation in real-time. Summative feedback, on the other hand, is more reflective and can be used to evaluate the overall performance.

#### Providing Effective Feedback

Effective feedback should be specific, constructive, and actionable. It should focus on the presentation rather than the presenter, and should highlight both strengths and weaknesses. Feedback should also be timely, with formative feedback given during the presentation and summative feedback provided shortly after.

#### Receiving Feedback

Receiving feedback can be challenging, but it is crucial for personal and academic growth. Students should approach feedback with an open mind and a willingness to learn. They should listen actively and take notes, and should not be defensive. Feedback should be used as a tool for improvement, not as a measure of personal worth.

#### Feedback and the QUIS

The QUIS (Questionnaire for User Interaction Satisfaction) can be a useful tool for providing feedback on student presentations. The QUIS Version 5.5, in particular, has been designed to address the limitations of previous versions and to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of interface usability.

### Section: 8.1 Work Time:

Work time is a crucial aspect of the creative process in the visual arts. It is the time spent on creating a piece of art, from the initial idea to the final product. In this section, we will explore the various factors that influence work time and the different stages of work time.

#### 8.1a Understanding Work Time

Work time can be broken down into three main stages: planning and research, creation, and final touches. Each stage requires a different amount of time and effort, and the overall work time can vary greatly depending on the complexity of the project and the artist's skill level.

The first stage, planning and research, is where the artist develops their initial idea and gathers information and inspiration. This stage can be time-consuming, as it involves brainstorming, sketching, and researching relevant topics. The amount of time spent on this stage can vary greatly, depending on the artist's creative process and the complexity of the project.

The second stage, creation, is where the artist brings their idea to life. This stage involves translating the initial idea into a tangible form, whether it be a painting, sculpture, or digital art piece. The amount of time spent on this stage can vary depending on the medium and techniques used, as well as the artist's skill level.

The final stage, final touches, is where the artist makes any necessary adjustments and refinements to the piece. This stage can be quick or time-consuming, depending on the artist's level of satisfaction with the final product.

In addition to these stages, work time can also be influenced by external factors such as deadlines, distractions, and the availability of resources. Time management is a crucial skill for artists to develop, as it can greatly impact the quality and success of a project.

#### 8.1b Techniques for Effective Work Time

To effectively manage work time, artists can employ various techniques and strategies. One such technique is the Pomodoro Method, developed by Francesco Cirillo. This method involves breaking work time into 25-minute intervals, with short breaks in between. This allows for focused and productive work, as well as breaks to recharge and refocus.

Another technique is the Eisenhower Matrix, which helps artists prioritize tasks and manage their time effectively. This matrix categorizes tasks based on their urgency and importance, allowing artists to focus on the most critical tasks first.

In addition to these techniques, artists can also benefit from using project management software or tools to track and manage their work time. These tools can help artists stay organized, set deadlines, and track their progress, allowing for more efficient and effective work time.

#### 8.1c Case Studies of Work Time

To further illustrate the importance of work time and effective time management in the visual arts, let's look at some case studies.

One such case study is the work of artist and designer Stefan Sagmeister. In his book "Things I Have Learned in My Life So Far", Sagmeister discusses his approach to work time and how he structures his days to be as productive as possible. He also emphasizes the importance of taking breaks and allowing for creativity to flow.

Another case study is the work of artist and illustrator James Jean. In an interview, Jean discusses his work process and how he manages his time to balance his personal projects with commissioned work. He also touches upon the importance of setting boundaries and prioritizing tasks.

These case studies demonstrate the diverse approaches artists can take to managing their work time, but also highlight the common themes of prioritization, organization, and taking breaks. By understanding and implementing these techniques, artists can effectively manage their work time and create high-quality visual art pieces.


### Conclusion
In this chapter, we have explored the importance of work time in the visual arts. We have discussed the various factors that can affect work time, such as deadlines, distractions, and personal productivity. We have also looked at different strategies for managing work time, including time blocking, Pomodoro technique, and the Eisenhower matrix. By understanding and implementing these techniques, artists can improve their productivity and achieve their goals.

## Chapter: BSAD Foundations in the Visual Arts: A Comprehensive Guide

### Introduction

In this chapter, we will explore the concept of visual arts in the context of BSAD (Basic Sequential Art Design). BSAD is a fundamental approach to creating visual art, which is based on the principles of sequential art. It is a powerful tool for artists to effectively communicate their ideas and stories through a series of images. In this chapter, we will delve into the various aspects of BSAD, including its history, principles, and techniques. We will also discuss how BSAD can be applied in the visual arts, and how it can enhance the creative process. By the end of this chapter, you will have a comprehensive understanding of BSAD and its role in the visual arts.

# Interruption science

## Knowledge workers

Office workers face a number of interruptions due to information technologies such as e-mail, text messages, and phone calls. One line of research in interruption science examines the disruptive effects of these technologies and how to improve the usability and design of such devices. According to Gloria Mark, "the average knowledge worker switches tasks every three minutes, and, once distracted, a worker can take nearly a half-hour to resume the original task". Mark conducted a study on office workers, which revealed that "each employee spent only 11 minutes on any given project before being interrupted". Kelemen et al. showed that a team of programmers is interrupted through a technical Skype support chat up to 150 times a day, but these interruptions can be reduced by introducing a dispatcher role and a knowledge base.

### Notifications

One of the major challenges associated with increased reliance on information technologies is they will send users notifications, without considering current task demands. Answering notifications impedes task performance and the ability to resume to the original task at hand. In addition, even just knowing that one has received a notification can negatively impact sustained attention.

Several solutions have been proposed to this problem. One study suggested entirely disable email notifications. The down side was it may induce a pressure to constant need to check their email accounts. In fact, entirely removing notifications may lead people to spend more time checking their email. The absence of e-mail notifications is often seen as counterproductive because of the required "catch-up" time periods after a long time between email checking. Alternatively, there are several attempts to design software applications that deliver notifications when there is an identified break from work, or categorize notifications based on their relative importance (e.g. Oasis).

Research has also investigated the impact of notifications on work time. One study found that workers who received frequent notifications took longer to complete tasks and made more errors compared to those who received fewer notifications. This highlights the importance of managing notifications and finding a balance between staying connected and maintaining focus on work.

### Section: 8.1 Work Time:

Work time is a crucial aspect of the creative process in the visual arts. It is the time spent on creating a piece of art, from the initial idea to the final product. In this section, we will explore the various factors that influence work time and the different stages of work time.

#### 8.1a Understanding Work Time

Work time can be broken down into three main stages: planning and research, creation, and final touches. Each stage requires a different amount of time and effort, and the overall work time can vary greatly depending on the complexity of the project and the artist's skill level.

The first stage, planning and research, is where the artist develops their initial idea and gathers information and inspiration. This stage can be time-consuming, as it involves brainstorming, sketching, and researching relevant topics. The amount of time spent on this stage can vary greatly, depending on the artist's creative process and the complexity of the project.

The second stage, creation, is where the artist brings their idea to life. This stage involves translating the initial idea into a tangible form, whether it be a painting, sculpture, or digital art piece. The amount of time spent on this stage can vary depending on the medium and techniques used, as well as the artist's skill level.

The final stage, final touches, is where the artist makes any necessary adjustments and refinements to the piece. This stage can be quick or time-consuming, depending on the artist's level of satisfaction with the final product.

In addition to these stages, work time can also be influenced by external factors such as deadlines, distractions, and the availability of resources. Time management is a crucial skill for artists to develop, as it can greatly impact the quality and success of a project.

#### 8.1b Techniques for Effective Work Time

To effectively manage work time, artists can employ various techniques and strategies. One such technique is time blocking, where the artist dedicates specific blocks of time to each stage of the creative process. This allows for a more structured and efficient use of time, ensuring that each stage receives the necessary attention and effort.

Another technique is the Pomodoro method, where the artist works in 25-minute intervals, taking short breaks in between. This method helps to maintain focus and productivity, as well as prevent burnout.

Additionally, artists can also use productivity tools and software to help manage their work time. These tools can include task management systems, time tracking software, and productivity apps.

By employing these techniques and strategies, artists can effectively manage their work time and maximize their productivity in the visual arts.

### Section: 14.1 Review of Shaping Time:

In this section, we will be reviewing the concept of shaping time in the context of BSAD Foundations in the Visual Arts. Time is a fundamental element in the creation and interpretation of visual artworks. It is not only the physical time in which the artwork is created and experienced, but also the temporal qualities that are inherent in the artwork itself. These temporal qualities can range from the immediate and fleeting to the enduring and timeless, and they are crucial in shaping the meaning and impact of the artwork.

#### 14.1a Recap of Shaping Time

In the previous chapters, we have explored various techniques used by artists to shape time in their works. These techniques include the use of light, color, composition, and movement. We have also delved into the role of the viewer in perceiving and interpreting these temporal qualities, and how this can influence the overall experience of the artwork.

Light plays a crucial role in shaping time in visual art. The way light is used can create a sense of time and atmosphere in a work. For instance, the use of natural light can evoke a sense of daytime and naturalness, while artificial light can suggest a different time of day or a different atmosphere.

Color is another important element in shaping time. Different colors can evoke different emotions and moods, which can in turn influence the perception of time. For example, warm colors like red and orange can suggest a sense of energy and immediacy, while cool colors like blue and green can evoke a sense of calmness and timelessness.

Composition is also a key factor in shaping time. The arrangement of elements within a work can create a sense of movement and flow, which can suggest a certain pace and duration. For instance, a composition with strong diagonal lines can suggest a sense of urgency and immediacy, while a composition with horizontal lines can evoke a sense of calmness and timelessness.

Movement is another important aspect of shaping time. The movement of elements within a work can create a sense of dynamism and change, which can suggest a certain duration and pace. For example, a work with rapid and erratic movements can suggest a sense of fleetingness and ephemerality, while a work with slow and deliberate movements can evoke a sense of endurance and timelessness.

In the next section, we will delve deeper into the role of the viewer in perceiving and interpreting these temporal qualities, and how this can influence the overall experience of the artwork.

#### 14.1b Analysis of Shaping Time

In this subsection, we will delve deeper into the analysis of how time is shaped in visual art. We will explore the role of the viewer in perceiving and interpreting these temporal qualities, and how this can influence the overall experience of the artwork.

The viewer plays a crucial role in shaping time in visual art. The viewer's perception of time is influenced by their personal experiences, cultural background, and emotional state. For instance, a viewer who has experienced a particular event or emotion may perceive a work of art in a different way than a viewer who has not. This can lead to different interpretations of the same work, and can also influence the viewer's emotional response to the work.

The viewer's perception of time is also influenced by the temporal qualities inherent in the artwork itself. As mentioned earlier, different colors, compositions, and movements can evoke different emotions and moods, which can in turn influence the perception of time. For example, a viewer who is experiencing a sense of calmness and timelessness may perceive a work with cool colors and horizontal lines in a different way than a viewer who is experiencing a sense of urgency and immediacy.

Furthermore, the viewer's perception of time can also be influenced by the context in which the artwork is viewed. For instance, a work of art viewed in a gallery or museum may be perceived differently than the same work viewed in a private home or public space. The context can provide additional information about the artwork, which can influence the viewer's perception of time.

In conclusion, the analysis of shaping time in visual art involves understanding the role of the viewer in perceiving and interpreting temporal qualities. This can provide valuable insights into the meaning and impact of the artwork, and can also lead to a deeper appreciation of the work.

#### 14.1c Applications of Shaping Time

In this subsection, we will explore some practical applications of shaping time in visual art. These applications demonstrate how the concepts discussed in the previous sections can be applied in real-world scenarios.

One of the most common applications of shaping time in visual art is in the creation of time-lapse videos. Time-lapse videos are a series of images captured at set intervals, which are then played back at a faster rate to create the illusion of time passing more quickly. This technique can be used to capture the passage of time in a single location, or to show the creation of a work of art. For example, a time-lapse video could be used to show the creation of a painting, with each frame representing a different stage of the painting's development. This not only allows the viewer to see the painting being created, but also provides a sense of the time and effort involved in its creation.

Another application of shaping time in visual art is in the creation of interactive installations. These installations often use light, color, and movement to create a sense of time and atmosphere. For instance, an interactive installation might use light to represent the passage of time, with the light changing color and intensity to suggest different times of day or different moods. The viewer's interaction with the installation can also shape the sense of time. For example, the viewer might be able to control the light or color, or their movements might trigger changes in the installation. This allows the viewer to actively participate in shaping the time and atmosphere of the artwork.

Shaping time can also be applied in the creation of digital artworks. Digital artworks can use algorithms and programming languages to create dynamic and interactive experiences. For example, a digital artwork might use a programming language like Processing to create a sense of time and movement. The artwork might use algorithms to generate patterns or shapes that change over time, creating a sense of dynamism and change. The viewer's interaction with the artwork can also shape the sense of time. For example, the viewer might be able to control the speed or direction of the patterns or shapes, or their movements might trigger changes in the artwork. This allows the viewer to actively participate in shaping the time and experience of the artwork.

In conclusion, shaping time in visual art is not just a theoretical concept, but has practical applications in the creation of time-lapse videos, interactive installations, and digital artworks. These applications demonstrate the power of shaping time in creating engaging and dynamic visual experiences.

One of the most famous examples of body extension in the visual arts is Leonardo da Vinci's "The Last Supper." In this painting, da Vinci uses linear perspective to create a sense of depth and space. By drawing the lines of the table and walls in perspective, he creates the illusion of a three-dimensional space. This technique is particularly effective in the upper left corner of the painting, where the lines of the wall and ceiling appear to converge in the distance.

#### 15.1c.2 Michelangelo's "The Creation of Adam"

Another example of body extension in the visual arts is Michelangelo's "The Creation of Adam." In this painting, Michelangelo uses atmospheric perspective to create a sense of depth and space. By using lighter colors and brushstrokes in the background, he creates the illusion of a distant landscape. This technique is particularly effective in the upper right corner of the painting, where the sky appears to fade into the distance.

#### 15.1c.3 Ingres' "La Grande Odalisque"

Ingres' "La Grande Odalisque" is a prime example of body extension in the visual arts. In this painting, Ingres uses long, flowing lines to extend the body of the odalisque, creating a sense of movement and energy. This technique is particularly effective in the lower left corner of the painting, where the lines of the odalisque's body appear to flow into the background.

#### 15.1c.4 Pixar's "Toy Story"

In the world of animation, Pixar's "Toy Story" is a prime example of body extension. In this film, Pixar uses computer animation to create a sense of depth and space. By using perspective and lighting, they create the illusion of a three-dimensional world.

### Subsection: 16.2a Introduction to Sewing Machine

Sewing machines have been an integral part of the textile industry since their invention in the late 18th century. They have greatly improved the efficiency and productivity of the clothing industry, making it possible to produce large quantities of clothing in a shorter amount of time. In this section, we will explore the basics of sewing machines, including their history, types, and how they work.

#### 16.2a.1 History of Sewing Machines

The first sewing machine was invented by Englishman Thomas Saint in 1790. It was a hand-cranked machine that used a series of hooks to create stitches. However, it was not until the early 19th century that sewing machines became widely used in the textile industry.

The first practical sewing machine was invented by French tailor Barthelemy Thimonnier in 1830. His machine used a series of needles to create stitches, and it was the first machine to be used for commercial production. However, Thimonnier's machine was not widely adopted due to patent disputes and resistance from the tailors' guild.

It was not until the 1840s that sewing machines became widely available and affordable. The first mass-produced sewing machine was invented by Elias Howe in 1845. His machine used a single needle and a shuttle to create stitches, and it was the first machine to be powered by a foot-operated treadle mechanism.

#### 16.2a.2 Types of Sewing Machines

There are several types of sewing machines, each with its own unique features and uses. The most common types include:

- Domestic sewing machines: These machines are designed for home use and are typically smaller and less expensive than industrial machines. They are used for sewing clothing, quilts, and other household items.
- Industrial sewing machines: These machines are larger and more powerful than domestic machines. They are used for commercial production of clothing, textiles, and other products.
- Computerized sewing machines: These machines use computerized controls to create precise and intricate stitches. They are often used in the production of high-end clothing and accessories.

#### 16.2a.3 How Sewing Machines Work

Sewing machines work by using a series of needles and threads to create stitches. The machine is powered by either a hand crank or a foot-operated treadle mechanism. The fabric is fed through the machine, and the needles create stitches to hold the fabric together.

The machine also has a bobbin that holds the thread for the bottom stitch. As the fabric is fed through the machine, the bobbin is wound and the thread is fed through the needle to create the stitch. The machine also has a presser foot that holds the fabric in place while the needle creates the stitch.

In the next section, we will explore the different types of stitches that can be created using a sewing machine.

#### 19.2b Analysis of Michael Joo Exhibition

The Michael Joo exhibition at the List Gallery is a complex and multifaceted exploration of space and the universe. Joo's work is characterized by a deep exploration of the space between things, the spaces that are often overlooked or unnoticed. This space, according to Joo, is where the real action happens. It is where the unseen forces of the universe interact, creating the world as we know it. This exploration of the space between is a recurring theme in Joo's work, and it is central to this exhibition.

Joo's work is not just about the physical space, but also about the metaphysical space. This is evident in his use of materials and techniques. For instance, in his sculptures, Joo often uses materials that are associated with the universe, such as rocks and minerals. He also employs techniques that suggest the processes of the universe, such as melting and crystallization. These elements create a sense of the cosmic in the works, underscoring the metaphysical dimensions of the artist's exploration of space.

The exhibition also features a series of drawings, which Joo refers to as "cosmic diagrams." These drawings are maps of the universe, as Joo sees it. They are complex, intricate, and beautiful, reflecting the complexity and beauty of the universe. They are also deeply personal, reflecting Joo's own perceptions and understandings of the universe.

Joo's work is not just about the physical space, but also about the metaphysical space. This is evident in his use of materials and techniques. For instance, in his sculptures, Joo often uses materials that are associated with the universe, such as rocks and minerals. He also employs techniques that suggest the processes of the universe, such as melting and crystallization. These elements create a sense of the cosmic in the works, underscoring the metaphysical dimensions of the artist's exploration of space.

The exhibition also features a series of drawings, which Joo refers to as "cosmic diagrams." These drawings are maps of the universe, as Joo sees it. They are complex, intricate, and beautiful, reflecting the complexity and beauty of the universe. They are also deeply personal, reflecting Joo's own perceptions and understandings of the universe.

## Chapter: - Chapter 20: Work Day:




### Section: 20.1 Work Day:

### Subsection: 20.1a Managing Work Day

In the previous chapter, we discussed the importance of time management in the visual arts. Now, we will delve deeper into the practical aspects of managing a work day in the visual arts.

#### 20.1a Managing Work Day

The work day in the visual arts is a complex and dynamic entity. It is not a fixed schedule, but rather a fluid process that requires constant adaptation and prioritization. As artists, we must learn to navigate this process effectively in order to maximize our productivity and creativity.

The first step in managing a work day is to establish a routine. This can be a challenging task for artists, as our work often involves unconventional hours and schedules. However, establishing a routine can provide a sense of structure and discipline, which can be beneficial for productivity. This routine can include specific tasks, such as setting aside a certain amount of time for sketching, painting, or digital art. It can also involve more general practices, such as starting each day with a warm-up exercise or ending each day with a reflection on the work completed.

Once a routine is established, it is important to prioritize tasks. This can be done using various techniques, such as the Eisenhower Matrix or the Pomodoro Technique. The Eisenhower Matrix, named after President Dwight D. Eisenhower, helps to prioritize tasks based on their urgency and importance. Urgent and important tasks should be given top priority, while non-urgent and unimportant tasks can be delegated or eliminated. The Pomodoro Technique, on the other hand, involves breaking the work day into 25-minute intervals, with short breaks in between. This can help to increase focus and productivity.

In addition to prioritizing tasks, it is important to allocate time effectively. This can be achieved by using time-blocking, a technique that involves dedicating specific blocks of time to individual tasks. This can help to avoid distractions and interruptions, and can also provide a sense of accountability and motivation.

Finally, it is important to regularly review and adjust the work day schedule. As artists, our needs and priorities can change from day to day, and it is important to be flexible and adapt our work day accordingly. This can involve setting weekly or monthly goals, and adjusting the schedule as needed to achieve these goals.

In conclusion, managing a work day in the visual arts requires a combination of routine, prioritization, time allocation, and regular review. By implementing these strategies, artists can maximize their productivity and creativity, and achieve their goals in a sustainable and fulfilling manner.





### Section: 20.1b Techniques for Effective Work Day

In addition to managing tasks and time, there are several other techniques that can help to make the most of a work day in the visual arts. These include:

#### 20.1b.1 Collaborative Work

Collaborative work can be a powerful tool for artists. By working with others, artists can share ideas, learn from each other, and create a sense of community. This can be particularly beneficial for artists who work alone, as it provides an opportunity for social interaction and feedback. Collaborative work can take many forms, from formal partnerships to informal group discussions.

#### 20.1b.2 Continuous Learning

The visual arts are a field of constant learning and evolution. As artists, we must be open to learning new techniques, exploring new mediums, and experimenting with new ideas. This can be achieved through a variety of means, including formal education, workshops, and online tutorials. Continuous learning not only enhances our skills and creativity, but also helps to keep us motivated and engaged in our work.

#### 20.1b.3 Self-Care

Self-care is often overlooked, but it is a crucial aspect of a healthy and productive work day. This includes taking care of our physical health (e.g., eating well, exercising, getting enough sleep), our mental health (e.g., managing stress, practicing mindfulness), and our emotional health (e.g., expressing emotions, maintaining relationships). Self-care can help to improve our overall well-being, which in turn can enhance our productivity and creativity.

#### 20.1b.4 Balancing Work and Life

Finally, it is important to find a balance between our work and our personal life. This can be a challenge for artists, as our work often bleeds into our personal time. However, maintaining a healthy balance can help to prevent burnout and keep us motivated and inspired. This can be achieved through setting boundaries, prioritizing self-care, and regularly taking time off.

In conclusion, managing a work day in the visual arts requires a combination of techniques and strategies. By establishing a routine, prioritizing tasks, allocating time effectively, engaging in collaborative work, pursuing continuous learning, practicing self-care, and finding a balance between work and life, artists can maximize their productivity and creativity.
