## Chapter 1: Course Introduction:




### Section 1.1 Understanding Main Street Sites

Main streets are the heart of any urban area, serving as a hub for commerce, transportation, and community life. However, as cities continue to grow and evolve, these main streets often face challenges that can hinder their vitality and livability. In this section, we will explore the various factors that contribute to the character and condition of main streets, with a specific focus on St. Claude Avenue in New Orleans.

#### 1.1a Understanding Main Street Sites

To fully understand the challenges and opportunities of revitalizing main streets, it is crucial to first understand the unique characteristics and context of each site. Main streets are shaped by a variety of factors, including their physical environment, history, and surrounding community. These factors can have a significant impact on the condition and potential of a main street.

One of the key factors that contribute to the character of a main street is its physical environment. This includes the layout and design of the street, as well as the surrounding buildings and land use. For example, St. Claude Avenue in New Orleans is known for its historic architecture and tree-lined streets, which add to its charm and character. However, these same features can also pose challenges for revitalization efforts, as any changes to the street must be carefully considered to maintain its historic integrity.

The history of a main street also plays a significant role in its current condition and potential for revitalization. Main streets often have a rich history, with many serving as important cultural and economic hubs for their communities. However, this history can also bring challenges, as many main streets have experienced decline and disinvestment over time. For example, St. Claude Avenue has a history of industrial use and neglect, which has left it with a number of vacant and abandoned properties.

The surrounding community also plays a crucial role in the character and condition of a main street. The demographics, income levels, and needs of the community can greatly impact the types of businesses and services that are able to thrive on a main street. Additionally, the level of community engagement and support can greatly influence the success of revitalization efforts.

In the next section, we will explore the specific challenges faced by St. Claude Avenue and the surrounding community, and how these factors have contributed to its current condition. By understanding the unique characteristics and context of main streets, we can better address their challenges and create vibrant and sustainable urban spaces.





### Section 1.1b Analyzing Main Street Issues

In order to effectively revitalize main streets, it is important to first understand the issues that are hindering their vitality and livability. These issues can range from physical challenges, such as deteriorating infrastructure, to social challenges, such as lack of community engagement. By analyzing these issues, we can gain a better understanding of the root causes of a main street's decline and develop targeted strategies for revitalization.

One of the key tools for analyzing main street issues is through the use of GIS (Geographic Information System) technology. GIS allows for the visualization and analysis of spatial data, providing a comprehensive understanding of the physical, social, and economic characteristics of a main street. By using GIS, we can identify patterns and trends in data, such as areas of high crime or low property values, and use this information to inform revitalization efforts.

Another important aspect of analyzing main street issues is through community engagement. By involving the local community in the analysis process, we can gain valuable insights and perspectives on the challenges and opportunities of a main street. This can be done through surveys, focus groups, and community meetings, where residents can share their thoughts and concerns about the main street.

In addition to physical and social challenges, main streets also face economic issues that can hinder their revitalization. These issues can include high vacancy rates, lack of affordable housing, and inadequate transportation options. By analyzing these economic issues, we can develop strategies to address them and create a more vibrant and sustainable main street.

Overall, analyzing main street issues is a crucial step in the revitalization process. By using tools such as GIS and community engagement, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the challenges and opportunities of a main street and develop targeted strategies for revitalization. In the next section, we will explore some of the key issues facing St. Claude Avenue in New Orleans and how they can be addressed.





### Subsection 1.2a Causes of Urban Neighborhood Decline

Urban neighborhood decline is a complex issue that has been studied extensively by urban planners and sociologists. There are numerous factors that contribute to the decline of urban neighborhoods, including economic, social, and physical factors. In this section, we will explore some of the key causes of urban neighborhood decline.

#### Economic Factors

One of the main economic factors that contribute to urban neighborhood decline is the loss of jobs and businesses. As industries and businesses move out of urban areas, they take jobs and economic opportunities with them. This can lead to a decrease in property values, as well as a decrease in the overall economic health of the neighborhood. Additionally, the loss of jobs can also lead to a decrease in income for residents, making it difficult for them to afford basic necessities.

Another economic factor that contributes to urban neighborhood decline is the lack of affordable housing. As housing costs continue to rise, many low-income residents are forced to move to other areas, leading to a decrease in population and a decline in the overall vitality of the neighborhood. This can also lead to a decrease in property values, as there are fewer residents to support the local economy.

#### Social Factors

Social factors also play a significant role in urban neighborhood decline. The loss of social capital, or the sense of community and connection among residents, can lead to a decline in the overall quality of life in a neighborhood. This can be caused by factors such as urban sprawl, which can create barriers to social interaction and community cohesion. Additionally, the loss of public spaces, such as parks and community centers, can also contribute to a decline in social capital.

#### Physical Factors

Physical factors, such as the condition of infrastructure and public spaces, can also contribute to urban neighborhood decline. Neglect and disinvestment in public spaces, such as parks and sidewalks, can lead to a decline in the overall appearance and livability of a neighborhood. This can also make it difficult for businesses to thrive, as they may not want to locate in an area with poor physical conditions.

In addition to neglect and disinvestment, urban neighborhood decline can also be caused by physical factors such as pollution and environmental hazards. These can have a negative impact on the health and well-being of residents, as well as the overall livability of a neighborhood.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, urban neighborhood decline is a complex issue with numerous causes. Economic, social, and physical factors all play a role in the decline of urban neighborhoods. It is important for urban planners and policymakers to address these factors in order to revitalize and improve the quality of life in urban neighborhoods. In the next section, we will explore some of the consequences of urban neighborhood decline.





### Subsection 1.2b Consequences of Urban Neighborhood Decline

The consequences of urban neighborhood decline are far-reaching and can have a significant impact on the quality of life for residents. In this section, we will explore some of the key consequences of urban neighborhood decline.

#### Economic Consequences

The economic consequences of urban neighborhood decline can be devastating. As mentioned earlier, the loss of jobs and businesses can lead to a decrease in property values and overall economic health of the neighborhood. This can also result in a decrease in tax revenue for the city, making it difficult to provide essential services to residents. Additionally, the loss of affordable housing can also lead to an increase in homelessness and poverty, further exacerbating economic inequalities.

#### Social Consequences

The social consequences of urban neighborhood decline can also be significant. The loss of social capital can lead to a sense of isolation and disconnection among residents, making it difficult for them to access support and resources. This can also lead to an increase in crime and other social issues, as there is a lack of community cohesion and support. Furthermore, the loss of public spaces can also limit opportunities for social interaction and community building.

#### Physical Consequences

The physical consequences of urban neighborhood decline can also be detrimental. Neglect and disinvestment can lead to the deterioration of infrastructure and public spaces, making it difficult for residents to access essential services and amenities. This can also lead to a decrease in property values and further exacerbate economic inequalities. Additionally, the loss of green spaces and natural resources can also have a negative impact on the environment and public health.

In conclusion, urban neighborhood decline has far-reaching consequences that can have a significant impact on the quality of life for residents. It is crucial for urban planners and policymakers to address these issues and work towards revitalizing urban main streets to create vibrant and thriving communities. 





### Subsection 1.2c Challenges in Urban Neighborhood Revitalization

Urban neighborhood revitalization is a complex and multifaceted process that requires addressing a variety of challenges. In this section, we will explore some of the key challenges faced in urban neighborhood revitalization.

#### Economic Challenges

One of the main challenges in urban neighborhood revitalization is the economic aspect. As mentioned earlier, the loss of jobs and businesses can lead to a decrease in property values and overall economic health of the neighborhood. This can make it difficult to attract new businesses and investment, as well as provide essential services to residents. Additionally, the cost of revitalization efforts can be a barrier for many communities, especially those with limited resources.

#### Social Challenges

Another challenge in urban neighborhood revitalization is the social aspect. The loss of social capital can make it difficult to build community support and involvement in revitalization efforts. This can also lead to a sense of disconnection and isolation among residents, making it difficult for them to access support and resources. Furthermore, addressing social issues such as crime and poverty can be complex and require collaboration between various stakeholders.

#### Physical Challenges

The physical challenges of urban neighborhood revitalization include the deterioration of infrastructure and public spaces. Neglect and disinvestment can make it difficult to attract new residents and businesses, as well as provide essential services to existing residents. Additionally, the loss of green spaces and natural resources can have a negative impact on the environment and public health.

#### Institutional Challenges

Institutional challenges also play a significant role in urban neighborhood revitalization. The lack of coordination and communication between different levels of government, as well as between government and community organizations, can hinder revitalization efforts. Additionally, the complexity of urban neighborhood revitalization requires a multidisciplinary approach, making it challenging to find and coordinate the necessary resources and expertise.

In conclusion, urban neighborhood revitalization is a complex and challenging process that requires addressing a variety of economic, social, physical, and institutional challenges. However, with proper planning, collaboration, and community involvement, it is possible to revitalize urban neighborhoods and improve the quality of life for residents.

# Title: Revitalizing Urban Main Streets: St. Claude Avenue, New Orleans":

## Chapter: - Chapter 2: New Orleans Background:




### Section: 2.1 Social, Political and Development History:

### Subsection: 2.1a Social History of New Orleans

New Orleans has a rich and complex social history that has shaped the city into what it is today. The city's social history is deeply intertwined with its political and development history, as social issues have often been at the forefront of political debates and have influenced the city's development.

#### The Early Social History of New Orleans

The early social history of New Orleans is closely tied to its founding and development as a French colony. The city was founded in 1718 by the French explorer Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville, who named it after the Duke of Orleans. The city was initially settled by French colonists, but it also attracted a diverse population of immigrants from other European countries, including Spain, Italy, and Germany.

The social dynamics of New Orleans were heavily influenced by the French colonial system, which allowed for a more relaxed and informal social structure compared to other European societies. This led to a more egalitarian society, where social status was not as strictly defined as in other places. This egalitarianism was also reflected in the city's architecture, with many of the early buildings being built in a simple and unpretentious manner.

#### The Influence of African and Caribbean Cultures

One of the most significant social developments in New Orleans' history was the arrival of African and Caribbean slaves in the 18th and 19th centuries. These slaves were brought to the city to work on the plantations and in the city itself, and their presence had a profound impact on the city's social and cultural landscape.

The African and Caribbean cultures brought to New Orleans were diverse and complex, with different traditions, religions, and languages. These cultures were not only preserved by the slaves, but also influenced the city's social and cultural development. The blending of African and Caribbean cultures with French and Spanish influences led to the creation of unique and distinct New Orleans culture, including music, cuisine, and traditions.

#### The Impact of Social Issues on New Orleans' Development

Social issues have played a significant role in shaping New Orleans' development throughout its history. The city has faced numerous social challenges, including slavery, segregation, and poverty, which have had a profound impact on its social and economic landscape.

The arrival of African and Caribbean slaves in the 18th and 19th centuries led to the development of a large and thriving slave community in New Orleans. This community was characterized by a complex social hierarchy, with slaves being owned by both white and black masters. The social dynamics of this community were heavily influenced by the French colonial system, which allowed for a more relaxed and informal social structure.

However, with the arrival of the United States in 1803, the city's social landscape began to change. The U.S. imposed stricter social norms and regulations, leading to the abolition of slavery in 1862. This marked a significant shift in the city's social history, as it led to the emancipation of over 100,000 slaves and the formation of a large and impoverished free black community.

The social issues faced by New Orleans have continued to shape its development in the modern era. The city has faced challenges such as poverty, crime, and racial inequality, which have had a significant impact on its social and economic landscape. However, the city has also made significant progress in addressing these issues, with initiatives such as the New Orleans Anti-Poverty Initiative and the New Orleans Workforce Investment Board.

In conclusion, the social history of New Orleans is a complex and dynamic one, shaped by a diverse and ever-changing population. The city's social issues have played a significant role in its development, and its unique social and cultural landscape continues to make it a vibrant and diverse city.

### Differing circumstances

Reconstruction has been easiest and quickest in the areas least damaged by the storm, mostly corresponding to the parts of the city developed before about 1900. These areas were built on naturally higher ground along the River front (such as Old Carrollton, Uptown, the Old Warehouse District, the French Quarter, Old Marigny, and Bywater), along with areas along natural ridges (such as Esplanade Ridge, Bayou St. John, Gentilly Ridge). Most of these older areas had no flooding at all or escaped serious flooding because of the raised design of older architecture which prevented floodwaters from entering homes. Another high area, much of which escaped serious flooding, was the set of Lake Shore developments between Lake Pontchartrain and Robert E. Lee Boulevard, built at a higher level than nearby land from mid-20th century dredging.

Due to the direction of the storm and the movement of storm surge, the West Bank section of the city, Algiers was spared flooding and became the first part of the city itself to officially reopen to residents.

In neighboring Jefferson Parish, the West Bank communities were similarly spared all but some wind damage (with a few spots of minor rain-generated flooding). On the East Bank, while parts of Metairie and other Jefferson communities experienced some flooding, due to lack of levee breaches this was much less severe than across the Parish line in Orleans (or the devastation of the 1947 Fort Lauderdale Hurricane which flooded most of Jefferson's East Bank).

Reconstruction of each section of the area has been addressed in the Army Corps LACPR Final Technical Report which identifies areas to not be rebuilt and areas to be rebuilt.

### Subsection: 2.2a Impact of Hurricane Katrina

Hurricane Katrina, one of the most destructive hurricanes in United States history, made landfall in New Orleans on August 29, 2005. The storm surge from Katrina, combined with the failure of the city's levee system, resulted in catastrophic flooding throughout the city. The storm surge was particularly severe in the Lower Ninth Ward and St. Bernard Parish, where it reached heights of up to 20 feet. The flooding was so severe that it took several days for rescue teams to reach some areas, and many residents were stranded for weeks.

The impact of Katrina on New Orleans was devastating. The storm destroyed over 150,000 homes, displaced over 1 million residents, and caused an estimated $108 billion in damage. The city's infrastructure was severely damaged, including its power grid, water supply, and transportation systems. The storm also caused significant damage to the city's historic architecture, particularly in the Lower Ninth Ward and other low-lying areas.

In the aftermath of Katrina, the city faced a daunting task of rebuilding and revitalizing its urban main streets. The city's planning process, which had been in place since the 1960s, was put to the test as it had to navigate the complexities of disaster recovery while also addressing the long-term needs of the city.

### Subsection: 2.2b Disaster Recovery and New Orleans’ Planning Process

The disaster recovery process in New Orleans was a complex and challenging endeavor. The city had to address the immediate needs of its residents, while also planning for the long-term future of the city. This required a comprehensive and coordinated effort from various government agencies, community organizations, and private sector entities.

The city's planning process, which had been in place since the 1960s, played a crucial role in guiding the disaster recovery efforts. The city's Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance, adopted in 1967, provided a framework for land use and development in the city. This ordinance was updated in 2006 to address the needs of the city in the aftermath of Katrina.

The city also established the Office of Recovery and Rebuilding, which was responsible for coordinating the city's disaster recovery efforts. This office worked closely with various stakeholders, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Louisiana Recovery Authority, to develop and implement a comprehensive plan for rebuilding the city.

The city's planning process also involved extensive community engagement, with residents, business owners, and other stakeholders participating in various planning processes to voice their concerns and ideas for the future of the city. This community engagement was crucial in ensuring that the city's recovery efforts were responsive to the needs and desires of its residents.

### Subsection: 2.2c Post-Katrina Urban Development

The impact of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans' urban development was profound. The storm not only destroyed physical infrastructure, but also disrupted the city's social and economic fabric. In the aftermath of the storm, the city faced a number of challenges, including a decline in population, a loss of jobs, and a decrease in property values.

However, the city also saw opportunities for revitalization and renewal. The disaster recovery process provided an opportunity to rethink and redesign the city's urban spaces. The city's planning process, guided by the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance, played a crucial role in guiding this process.

One of the key areas of focus in post-Katrina urban development was the revitalization of the city's main streets. The city's main streets, including St. Claude Avenue, were heavily damaged by the storm and required significant reconstruction. This provided an opportunity to not only rebuild, but also to improve and enhance these streets.

The city also focused on creating more sustainable and resilient urban spaces. This included incorporating green infrastructure, such as green roofs and rain gardens, to mitigate the impacts of future storms. The city also implemented stricter building codes to ensure that new developments were better equipped to withstand future disasters.

In addition to physical revitalization, the city also focused on social and economic revitalization. This included efforts to attract new businesses and residents to the city, as well as to support and empower existing residents and businesses. The city also implemented programs to provide affordable housing and job opportunities for its residents.

Overall, the post-Katrina urban development process in New Orleans was a complex and challenging endeavor. However, it also provided an opportunity for the city to rebuild and revitalize itself in a more sustainable and resilient manner. The city's planning process, guided by the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance, played a crucial role in guiding this process and ensuring that the city's recovery efforts were responsive to the needs and desires of its residents.
